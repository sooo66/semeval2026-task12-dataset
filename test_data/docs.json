NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken made the trip on a private space vehicle designed, built and launched by SpaceX.\n\nSpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule docked with the station at 10:17 a.m. ET while flying over the border of northern China and Mongolia.\n\nIt marks a historic moment for both NASA and SpaceX as the space agency relinquishes astronaut flying duties to commercial partners.\n\nNASA is partnering with private companies like Elon Musk's SpaceX to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station. Since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, NASA has relied on the Russian space agency Roscosmos for rides to space. SpaceX's launch of Hurley and Behnken ends a nearly decade-long reliance on Russia for access to the station.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption NASA / NASA TV NASA / NASA TV\n\nDuring their trip to the ISS, Hurley and Behnken tested the vehicle's control and life support systems. The two were even able to get a little sleep--pulling out sleeping bags and astronaut sleepwear for a few hours of shuteye in space. \"It was actually a pretty comfortable night's sleep,\" said Hurley.\n\nCrew Dragon is designed to dock autonomously to the ISS. Since this is a test flight of the spacecraft, Hurley and Doug took manual control of the spacecraft near the station to test the vehicle's controls before letting the computer take over for the final docking sequence.\n\n\"It flew very well, very crisp,\" radioed Hurley after the manual test flight near the station.\n\nHurley and Behnken will spend up to four months on the station. The two trained for spacewalks at Johnson Space Center before their flight. They join NASA's Chris Cassidy and Russian Cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner.\n\nOnce their mission is complete, Hurley and Behnken will return to Earth in the Crew Dragon capsule splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida.\n\nIf all goes well on this flight, SpaceX will send another group of astronauts to the station later this year. NASA's Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker, along with Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi may launch as early as August 30 from Kennedy Space Center.",

        "content": "Pumps and Tanks In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Lewis Research Center’s work with liquid hydrogen began shifting from combustion and cooling to the handling of the cryogenic fluid.\n\nOverview\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Lewis Research Center’s work with liquid hydrogen began shifting from combustion and cooling to the handling of the cryogenic fluid. High-performance liquid-fueled rockets require turbopumps to pump the fuel and oxidizer from their tanks to the fuel injectors at high rates of speed. These devices must operate at hundreds of rotations per minute and be able to restart themselves numerous times during a mission. Hydrogen pumps pose particular challenges since the cryogenic fluid is often near its boiling point. Cryogenic propellant tanks for space applications must be lightweight but sturdy enough to contain a heavy gas such as helium to naturally push the liquid into the supply line. Tanks also require insulation to prevent the cryogenic fuel from evaporating.\n\nThese issues had applications for the Centaur, Saturn, and nuclear rocket programs, as well as for future long-duration missions to other planets. The Rocket Systems Area made important contributions to the mastering of the pumping and storage of liquid hydrogen.\n\nDocuments\n\nBoiling Hydrogen\n\nHydrogen is usually stored just under its –423 °F boiling point so it is often evaporating, forming bubbles, as it enters the pump. Researchers strove to reduce this cavitation, which impairs the performance of the turbopump and eventually cause its physical degradation. Engineers designed impellers and inducers (spiral-shaped rotors that increased flow) at the pump’s inlet to reduce the effects of cavitation.\n\nResearchers used the hydrogen test loop at the Liquid Hydrogen Pump Facility (A Site) to study different impeller and inducer designs on centrifugal and axial-flow turbopumps. They were particularly interested in the coordination of different inducer and impeller designs to optimize flow and limit the effects of cavitation. Each test was run over three speeds while the liquid-hydrogen flow decreased from a maximum level to the point where the pump stopped. The researchers found that inducers with a flow rate that was higher than that of the impeller reduced cavitation but did little to stabilize the propellant flow. They also used A Site to compare the performance of impellers with and without shrouds, which were designed to prevent recirculation of the fluid.\n\nNASA designed the Boiling Fluids Rig at the Turbopump Facilty (C Site) specifically to study pumps operating in cavitating conditions. The experimental turbopump was submerged in a large tank of boiling hydrogen. Lewis researchers conducted extensive studies into the relationship between inducer and pump performance. They analyzed the inducer blade thickness and angles, the length of the propellant supply line, and the effect of radiation heating on the fluid. They also investigated the pumping of colder slush hydrogen, which could reduce the size of the fuel tanks.\n\nDocuments\n\nA mechanic works on a turbopump test rig inside of A Site.

(7/12/1964) NASA Rocket engine tests at Plum Brook Station’s J Site in the summer of 1962. NASA\n\nFluorine Pumps\n\nIn the 1960s rocket designers were interested in using liquid fluorine as an oxidizer paired with the liquid-hydrogen fuel. Fluorine was lighter and produced more energy than the traditional liquid oxygen, but it was extremely toxic and volatile. Researchers used the large test chamber at J–5 to study the ability of certain seal materials to withstand exposure to high-power fluorine or fluorine/oxygen flow present in turbopumps. They also erected an external stand at J–5 to investigate the effect of a fluorine spill on various materials commonly found at launch sites, including sand, gravel, water, and other fuels. Some interactions yielded fiery explosions and others lingering toxic fumes. The researchers identified charcoal as a good mitigation tool.\n\nResearchers from Lewis and Pratt & Whitney used the Fluorine Pump Facility (I Site) to investigate the use of liquid fluorine in turbopumps. Lewis conducted a multiyear study of a centrifugal pump with an inducer to improve performance in cavitating conditions and seals made from Kentanium (tungsten carbide) K–162B (Kennametal Inc.). Despite an explosion that gutted I Site, the program successfully demonstrated that cavitation would not be a significant problem for fluorine pumps. Pratt & Whitney testing in I Site demonstrated that fluorine could be substituted for oxygen in the turbopumps for their successful RL–10 engines. Despite Lewis’ overall success with liquid fluorine, there have been no commercial fluorine rocket engines to date.\n\nDocuments\n\nThe J-5 test chamber at Plum Brook Station was a former Ordnance Works hortonsphere converted into a materials compatibility laboratory. (10/20/1960) NASA The J-5 Materials Laboratory. NASA Researchers used this fluorine spill rig outside of the J-5 tank to study the reaction of liquid fluorine with various materials that might be present at launch areas. (5/27/1964) NASA This experimental fluorine turbopump exploded during an April 7, 1962 run at I Site. NASA\n\nPropellant Tank Durability\n\nLewis researchers used Rocket Systems Area facilities to study tank durability, pressurant variations, and insulation systems for both spacecraft and proposed in-space fuel depots. Rocket designers sought to minimize the weight of the fuel tanks while maximizing their strength. Stainless steel and steel alloys were the preferred materials for cryogenic fuel tanks in the 1960s. The most common method of testing a tank’s durability was referred to as cold shocking. The tank was filled with liquid nitrogen or another stable cryogenic fluid. The staff then emptied the tank and checked to see if the cold temperatures affected any of the welds, couplings, or lines.\n\nEngineers used several of the Rocket Systems Area’s sites to cold shock a variety of propellant tanks during this period. This was sometimes at the request of the manufacturer, sometimes to check the tank before performing another type of test, and sometimes to recheck it after a test run. The cold shock tests included Centaur tanks in the Hydraulics Laboratory (F Site) and Vacuum Environment Facility (J–3), the Arthur D. Little tanks at Tank Test Facility (J–4) and Cryogenic Propellant Tank Facility (K Site), and a variety of tanks ranging from 5 to 13 ft in diameter at K Site.\n\nTank Pressurization\n\nLiquid-fuel propellant tanks use a heavy gas to force the fluid out towards the turbopump. Too much of this pressurant gas would require thicker tank walls, adding to the vehicle’s weight. Not enough gas would slow the flow of the cryogenic fluid, resulting in boiling or cavitation.\n\nLewis researchers used K Site to study the performance of several pressurizing gases and injectors and to determine the effect of internal temperatures on cryogenic propellant tanks. The staff installed the tank in the test chamber, filled it with liquid hydrogen, adjusted the temperature, introduced the pressurizing gas, and measured the resulting hydrogen flow from the tank. They varied the injector types and temperatures, introduced vibrations to the tests, and changed the type of gas. The K Site tests assisted Lewis researchers in refining their predictive tools. The researchers also compared the performance of different pressurizing gases in tanks containing liquid methane.\n\nLewis also initiated a study on the necessity of boost pumps for the Centaur propellant flow system. These pumps accelerated the propellant flow from the tank to the turbopump but also increased the vehicle weight. Researchers conducted tests at the High Energy Rocket Engine Research Facility (B–1) test stand to determine if improved pressurizing gas performance eliminated the need for the boost pumps.\n\nDocuments\n\nA 9-foot diameter Lockheed tank installed in the K Site vacuum chamber at Plum Brook Station for acceptance testing.

NASA/DON PERDUE\n\nTank Insulation Systems\n\nNASA researchers used the Rocket Systems Area sites to examine methods for insulating cryogenic propellant tanks to prevent fuel evaporation during launch and over time in space on long-duration missions. Even minor temperature increases could lead to the loss of enough fuel to cause a mission failure. By the early 1960s, engineers determined that foam or multilayered aluminum was sufficient for short-term missions, whereas the use of shields to block solar radiation was the key to storage on long-term missions.\n\nLewis analyzed multilayer insulation systems designed by the Linde and Arthur D. Little corporations at J–3 and Tank Test Facility J–4. The former consisted of an aluminum and fiberglass layer encapsulated in an aluminum and Mylar jacket; the latter was a gold, Mylar, and aluminum layer separated by mesh silk layers. They also investigated the use of multilayer insulation shaped into removable blankets. The study provided information on methods of applying the blankets to the tank and the optimal number of layers to include. Lewis researchers also developed a unique self-evacuating multilayer insulation (SEMI) to prevent air from contacting the tank during ground holds. They verified SEMI performance at K Site.\n\nLewis researchers designed a Cryogenic Storage Test Vehicle to study the integration of shadowshields (which blocked solar radiation) and multilayer insulation into a realistic tanking system for long-duration missions. The vehicle included hydrogen and oxygen tanks, a simulated engine, and a nozzle. The researchers installed the vehicle in the K Site test chamber with a cold wall to simulate temperatures in space. They then verified the system’s performance in simulated near-Earth and deep space conditions.\n\nDocuments\n\nThe staff used cryoshrouds in K Site to simulate the cold temperatures of space during tests.

Credits: NASA/Bill Ingalls\n\nFor the first time in history, NASA astronauts have launched from American soil in a commercially built and operated American crew spacecraft on its way to the International Space Station. The SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft carrying NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley lifted off at 3:22 p.m. EDT Saturday on the company’s Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\n“Today a new era in human spaceflight begins as we once again launched American astronauts on American rockets from American soil on their way to the International Space Station, our national lab orbiting Earth,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. “I thank and congratulate Bob Behnken, Doug Hurley, and the SpaceX and NASA teams for this significant achievement for the United States. The launch of this commercial space system designed for humans is a phenomenal demonstration of American excellence and is an important step on our path to expand human exploration to the Moon and Mars.”\n\nKnown as NASA’s SpaceX Demo-2, the mission is an end-to-end test flight to validate the SpaceX crew transportation system, including launch, in-orbit, docking and landing operations. This is SpaceX’s second spaceflight test of its Crew Dragon and its first test with astronauts aboard, which will pave the way for its certification for regular crew flights to the station as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program.\n\n“This is a dream come true for me and everyone at SpaceX,” said Elon Musk, chief engineer at SpaceX. “It is the culmination of an incredible amount of work by the SpaceX team, by NASA and by a number of other partners in the process of making this happen. You can look at this as the results of a hundred thousand people roughly when you add up all the suppliers and everyone working incredibly hard to make this day happen.”\n\nThe program demonstrates NASA’s commitment to investing in commercial companies through public-private partnerships and builds on the success of American companies, including SpaceX, already delivering cargo to the space station.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, right, Vice President Mike Pence, and Second Lady Karen Pence watch the launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the company’s Crew Dragon spacecraft on NASA’s SpaceX Demo-2 mission with NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley onboard, Saturday, May 30, 2020, from the balcony of Operations Support Building II at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

Credits: NASA/Bill Ingalls\n\n“It’s difficult to put into words how proud I am of the people who got us here today,” said Kathy Lueders, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program manager. “When I think about all of the challenges overcome – from design and testing, to paper reviews, to working from home during a pandemic and balancing family demands with this critical mission – I am simply amazed at what the NASA and SpaceX teams have accomplished together. This is just the beginning; I will be watching with great anticipation as Bob and Doug get ready to dock to the space station tomorrow, and through every phase of this historic mission.”\n\nSpaceX controlled the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy’s Launch Control Center Firing Room 4, the former space shuttle control room, which SpaceX has leased as its primary launch control center. As Crew Dragon ascended into space, SpaceX commanded the spacecraft from its mission control center in Hawthorne, California. NASA teams are monitoring space station operations throughout the flight from Mission Control Center at the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\nThe SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft is scheduled to dock to the space station at 10:29 a.m. Sunday, May 31. NASA Television and the agency’s website are providing ongoing live coverage of the Crew Dragon’s trip to the orbiting laboratory. Behnken and Hurley will work with SpaceX mission control to verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system, and by maneuvering the thrusters, among other things. The first docking maneuver began Saturday, May 30, at 4:09 p.m., and the spacecraft will begin its close approach to the station at about 8:27 a.m. Sunday, May 31. Crew Dragon is designed to dock autonomously, but the crews onboard the spacecraft and the space station will diligently monitor the performance of the spacecraft as it approaches and docks to the forward port of the station’s Harmony module.\n\nAfter successfully docking, the crew will be welcomed aboard the International Space Station, where they will become members of the Expedition 63 crew, which currently includes NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy. NASA will continue live coverage through hatch opening and the crew welcoming ceremony. The crew will perform tests on Crew Dragon in addition to conducting research and other tasks with the space station crew.\n\nThree astronauts aboard the International Space Station will participate in a live NASA Television crew news conference from orbit on Monday, June 1, beginning at 11:15 a.m. on NASA TV and the agency’s website.\n\nDemo-2 Astronauts\n\nNASA astronauts Robert Behnken, foreground, and Douglas Hurley, wearing SpaceX spacesuits, are seen as they depart the Neil A. Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building for Launch Complex 39A to board the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft for the Demo-2 mission launch, Saturday, May 30, 2020, at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

Credits: NASA/Bill Ingalls\n\nBehnken is the joint operations commander for the mission, responsible for activities such as rendezvous, docking and undocking, as well as Demo-2 activities while the spacecraft is docked to the space station. He was selected as a NASA astronaut in 2000 and has completed two space shuttle flights. Behnken flew STS-123 in March 2008 and STS-130 in February 2010, performing three spacewalks during each mission. Born in St. Anne, Missouri, he has bachelor’s degrees in physics and mechanical engineering from Washington University in St. Louis and earned a master’s and doctorate in mechanical engineering from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Before joining NASA, he was a flight test engineer with the U.S. Air Force.\n\nNASA astronaut Douglas Hurley waves as he and fellow crew member Robert Behnken depart the Neil A.

Credits: NASA/Bill Ingalls\n\nHurley is the spacecraft commander for Demo-2, responsible for activities such as launch, landing and recovery. He was selected as an astronaut in 2000 and has completed two spaceflights. Hurley served as pilot and lead robotics operator for both STS‐127 in July 2009 and STS‐135, the final space shuttle mission, in July 2011. The New York native was born in Endicott but considers Apalachin his hometown. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering from Tulane University in New Orleans and graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in Patuxent River, Maryland. Before joining NASA, he was a fighter pilot and test pilot in the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nMission Objectives\n\nThe Demo-2 mission is the final major test before NASA’s Commercial Crew Program certifies Crew Dragon for operational, long-duration missions to the space station. As SpaceX’s final flight test, it will validate all aspects of its crew transportation system, including the Crew Dragon spacecraft, spacesuits, Falcon 9 launch vehicle, launch pad 39A and operations capabilities.\n\nWhile en route to the station, Behnken and Hurley will take control of Crew Dragon for two manual flight tests, demonstrating their ability to control the spacecraft should an issue with the spacecraft’s automated flight arise. On Saturday, May 30, while the spacecraft is coasting, the crew will test its roll, pitch and yaw. When Crew Dragon is about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) below the station and moving around to the docking axis, the crew will conduct manual in-orbit demonstrations of the control system in the event it were needed. After pausing, rendezvous will resume and mission managers will make a final decision about whether to proceed to docking as Crew Dragon approaches 20 meters (66 feet).\n\nFor operational missions, Crew Dragon will be able to launch as many as four crew members at a time and carry more than 220 pounds of cargo, allowing for an increased number crew members aboard the space station and increasing the time dedicated to research in the unique microgravity environment, as well as returning more science back to Earth.\n\nThe Crew Dragon being used for this flight test can stay in orbit about 110 days, and the specific mission duration will be determined once on station based on the readiness of the next commercial crew launch. The operational Crew Dragon spacecraft will be capable of staying in orbit for at least 210 days as a NASA requirement.\n\nAt the conclusion of the mission, Behnken and Hurley will board Crew Dragon, which will then autonomously undock, depart the space station, and re-enter Earth’s atmosphere. Upon splashdown off Florida’s Atlantic coast, the crew will be picked up by the SpaceX recovery ship and returned to the dock at Cape Canaveral.\n\nNASA’s Commercial Crew Program is working with SpaceX and Boeing to design, build, test and operate safe, reliable and cost-effective human transportation systems to low-Earth orbit. Both companies are focused on test missions, including abort system demonstrations and crew flight tests, ahead of regularly flying crew missions to the space station. Both companies’ crewed flights will be the first times in history NASA has sent astronauts to space on systems owned, built, tested and operated by private companies.\n\nLearn more about NASA’s Commercial Crew program at:\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/commercialcrew\n\n-end-\n\nJosh Finch / Stephanie Schierholz\n\nHeadquarters, Washington\n\n202-358-1100\n\njoshua.a.finch@nasa.gov / stephanie.schierholz@nasa.gov\n\nKyle Herring / Marie Lewis\n\nKennedy Space Center, Fla.\n\n321-867-2468\n\nkyle.j.herring@nasa.gov / marie.g.lewis@nasa.gov\n\nDan Huot / Brandi Dean\n\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n\n281-483-5111\n\ndaniel.g.huot@nasa.gov / brandi.k.dean@nasa.gov",

        "content": "An upgraded version of one of the solid rocket boosters being used for NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) experienced an anomaly during a test June 26.\n\nThe Demonstration Motor-1 (DM-1) Static Test took place at Northrop Grumman's facility in Promontory, Utah, simulating a launch-duration burn lasting about two minutes. It was the first demonstration of Grumman's Booster Obsolescence and Life Extension (BOLE) upgrade, an enhanced five-segmented motor designed with greater lifting power for later versions of SLS.\n\nShortly after the spokesperson on Grumman's recording marks T+100 seconds into the test, an outburst of flames can be seen erupting form the top of the engine nozzle. A few seconds later, as another spokesperson announces, \"activate aft deluge,\" an even larger burst comes from the rocket's exhaust, blowing nearby debris into the flames and around the test site.\n\nA solid rocket booster undergoes testing on June 26 at Northrop Grumman's test facility in Promontory, Utah. (Image credit: Northrop Grumman)\n\n\"Whoa,\" one of the test operators said as burn continued, before audibly gasping. Beyond that in-the-moment reaction, though, the anomaly was not acknowledged during the remainder of the test, which seemed to conclude as planned.\n\n\"While the motor appeared to perform well through the most harsh environments of the test, we observed an anomaly near the end of the two-plus minute burn. As a new design, and the largest segmented solid rocket booster ever built, this test provides us with valuable data to iterate our design for future developments,\" Jim Kalberer, Grumman's vice president of propulsion systems, said in a statement.\n\nSLS, NASA's rocket supporting the agency's Artemis program, was designed on the foundation of legacy systems used during the space shuttle era. SLS's core stage fuel tank is an augmented version of the one used to launch space shuttles, and the same RS-25 engines responsible for launching the space shuttles are launching to space again on SLS missions. The segments from the shuttle's solid rocket boosters are also flying again, too.\n\nAn infographic for one of Northrop Grumman's solid rocket boosters. (Image credit: Northrop Grumman)\n\nNorthrop Grumman supported Artemis 1, and will support Artemis 2 and Artemis 3 with shuttle-era hardware, before transitioning to newer hardware for Artemis 4 through Artemis 8. The company's BOLE engines aren't slated to be introduced for launch until Artemis 9, on the SLS Block 2.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

NASA's proposed budget for 2026 calls for the cancelation of the SLS rocket following Artemis 3.",

        "content": "Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket launches on its debut flight from Florida on Jan. 15, 2025.\n\nA NASA Mars mission's long and winding road to the launch pad is nearing its end.\n\nThe twin ESCAPADE (Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers) Mars probes had been scheduled to launch last October, on the first-ever flight of Blue Origin's huge, partially reusable New Glenn rocket.\n\nBut NASA took the two spacecraft off that flight in September, citing the possibility of a cost-increasing launch delay. That delay did in fact come to pass; New Glenn ended up debuting on Jan. 15, successfully carrying a test version of Blue Origin's Blue Ring spacecraft platform to Earth orbit. The company aimed to land New Glenn's first stage on a ship at sea as well but failed in the attempt.\n\nThe ESCAPADE mission, meanwhile, continued in its state of limbo, without a publicly announced launch date.\n\nBut that has now been cleared up. On Thursday (July 17), Blue Origin announced that ESCAPADE will launch the second-ever flight of New Glenn, which is targeted for no earlier than Aug. 15 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nThat's later than the company had originally planned; Blue Origin had been eyeing late spring for the flight, known as NG-2, but pushed it back last month.\n\n\"This will be an exciting mission for New Glenn and Mars exploration. ESCAPADE is not only New Glenn’s first interplanetary mission, it’s also the first multi-spacecraft orbital science mission to study the Martian magnetosphere. And, we hope to land and recover our booster for the first time. Mars, here we come. Thank you to @NASA for riding with us to space,\" Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp said via X on Thursday.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

(Image credit: NASA/Kim Shiflett)\n\nThe two ESCAPADE probes were built by California-based company Rocket Lab. They're known as Blue and Gold, the colors of the University of California, Berkeley, whose Space Sciences Laboratory will manage the $80 million mission for NASA.\n\nThat mission \"will analyze how Mars’ magnetic field guides particle flows around the planet, how energy and momentum are transported from the solar wind through the magnetosphere, and what processes control the flow of energy and matter into and out of the Martian atmosphere,\" NASA wrote in a description of ESCAPADE.\n\n\"The observations will reveal the planet’s real-time response to space weather and how the Martian magnetosphere changes over time,\" they added.",

        "content": "SpaceX made history today, flying NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to space aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft using a Falcon 9 rocket. The launch, titled ‘Demo-2’, is for the final demonstration mission in the human rating process of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon and Falcon 9, meaning that once this mission is complete, the launch vehicle will finally be certified for operational use for regular transportation of people to space. This was the second attempt, after an initial launch try last Wednesday was scrubbed due to weather conditions.\n\nThis is the first time ever that humans have been aboard a SpaceX vehicle as it launched. To date, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets have succeeded in delivering multiple cargo payloads to orbit, but Behnken and Hurley are the first people to make the trip with the private spaceflight company.\n\nSpaceX also successfully landed its first stage booster from the Falcon 9 used today – which means it will recover the first private spacecraft booster that has ever delivered human astronauts to space.\n\nNASA created the Commercial Crew space program to spur the development of private launch vehicles that would also be able to serve commercial customers in addition to the agency, in order to defray the cost of launch overall. Both SpaceX and Boeing ended up placing winning bids on the Commercial Crew contracts, and have subsequently developed human launch systems, though SpaceX is the first to actually fly people on their vehicle after Boeing encountered some unexpected issues in their last uncrewed demonstration flight.\n\nAstronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley bump fists to celebrate their history-making launch on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon.\n\nIt’s been multiple decades since a human took off from U.S. soil on a brand new launch vehicle, and this is also the first time anyone has flown to space from an American launch site since the Space Shuttle program was officially retired in 2011. Returning U.S. spaceflight capabilities also means NASA won’t have to rely on Russia’s Roscosmos and its Soyuz spacecraft exclusively to transport its astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) – could save more than $30 million per astronaut per trip as a result.\n\nToday’s launch kicks off a multi-week mission for Behnken and Hurley, which next involves a rendezvous with the ISS around 19 hours from now. Crew Dragon will first take around 30 minutes to perform a manual control test, wherein Behnken and Hurley will take over and fly the spacecraft themselves. This isn’t what would normally happen on a normal Crew Dragon mission, since the spacecraft is designed to make the trip to ISS on its own operating entirely in an automated manner.\n\nAfter that manual control test, Crew Dragon will once again take over and then fly the remainder of the way to the ISS, where it’ll dock itself with an entry hatch on the station. From there, Behnken and Hurley will transfer over to the station, where they’re set to stay for a period of between six and sixteen weeks, depending on NASA’s determination of how long the mission should last. This is somewhat dependent on staffing requirements on board the ISS, since currently there’s only one U.S. astronaut there in an operational capacity, and Hurley and Behnken will be tasked with assisting with experiments and maintenance on the station.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA – MAY 30: The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches into space with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken (R) and Doug Hurley aboard the rocket from the Kennedy Space Center on May 30, 2020 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The inaugural flight is the first manned mission since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011 to be launched into space from the United States.

This return part of the program is also designed to be fully automated, with the spacecraft preforming the necessary boost-back engine firing to control its re-entry and descent. Once in atmosphere, it’ll release its parachutes to slow the fall back to Earth, and coast to a landing in the Atlantic Ocean, where SpaceX crews will recover the capsule and provide the astronauts their ride back to dry land.\n\nSpaceX plans to begin flying astronauts to the ISS for fully, regular operational missions later this year if all goes well, and it has also signed agreements to begin offering berths to paying passengers for Crew Dragon space tourist trips (likely with an extremely high price tag) as early as next year.",

        "content": "July will see the launch of the groundbreaking Solar EruptioN Integral Field Spectrograph mission, or SNIFS. Delivered to space via a Black Brant IX sounding rocket, SNIFS will explore the energy and dynamics of the chromosphere, one of the most complex regions of the Sun’s atmosphere. The SNIFS mission’s launch window at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico opens on Friday, July 18.\n\nThe chromosphere is located between the Sun’s visible surface, or photosphere, and its outer layer, the corona. The different layers of the Sun’s atmosphere have been researched at length, but many questions persist about the chromosphere. “There’s still a lot of unknowns,” said Phillip Chamberlin, a research scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder and principal investigator for the SNIFS mission.\n\nThe reddish chromosphere is visible on the Sun’s right edge in this view of the Aug. 21, 2017, total solar eclipse from Madras, Oregon. Credit: NASA/Nat Gopalswamy\n\nThe chromosphere lies just below the corona, where powerful solar flares and massive coronal mass ejections are observed. These solar eruptions are the main drivers of space weather, the hazardous conditions in near-Earth space that threaten satellites and endanger astronauts. The SNIFS mission aims to learn more about how energy is converted and moves through the chromosphere, where it can ultimately power these massive explosions.\n\n“To make sure the Earth is safe from space weather, we really would like to be able to model things,” said Vicki Herde, a doctoral graduate of CU Boulder who worked with Chamberlin to develop SNIFS.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video This footage from NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory shows the Sun in the 304-angstrom band of extreme ultraviolet light, which primarily reveals light from the chromosphere. This video, captured on Feb. 22, 2024, shows a solar flare — as seen in the bright flash on the upper left. Credit: NASA/SDO\n\nThe SNIFS mission is the first ever solar ultraviolet integral field spectrograph, an advanced technology combining an imager and a spectrograph. Imagers capture photos and videos, which are good for seeing the combined light from a large field of view all at once. Spectrographs dissect light into its various wavelengths, revealing which elements are present in the light source, their temperature, and how they’re moving — but only from a single location at a time.\n\nThe SNIFS mission combines these two technologies into one instrument.\n\n“It’s the best of both worlds,” said Chamberlin. “You’re pushing the limit of what technology allows us to do.”\n\nBy focusing on specific wavelengths, known as spectral lines, the SNIFS mission will help scientists to learn about the chromosphere. These wavelengths include a spectral line of hydrogen that is the brightest line in the Sun’s ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, and two spectral lines from the elements silicon and oxygen. Together, data from these spectral lines will help reveal how the chromosphere connects with upper atmosphere by tracing how solar material and energy move through it.\n\nThe SNIFS mission will be carried into space by a sounding rocket. These rockets are effective tools for launching and carrying space experiments and offer a valuable opportunity for hands-on experience, particularly for students and early-career researchers.\n\n(From left to right) Vicki Herde, Joseph Wallace, and Gabi Gonzalez, who worked on the SNIFS mission, stand with the sounding rocket containing the rocket payload at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Credit: courtesy of Phillip Chamberlin\n\n“You can really try some wild things,” Herde said. “It gives the opportunity to allow students to touch the hardware.”\n\nChamberlin emphasized how beneficial these types of missions can be for science and engineering students like Herde, or the next generation of space scientists, who “come with a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of new ideas, new techniques,” he said.\n\nThe entirety of the SNIFS mission will likely last up to 15 minutes. After launch, the sounding rocket is expected to take 90 seconds to make it to space and point toward the Sun, seven to eight minutes to perform the experiment on the chromosphere, and three to five minutes to return to Earth’s surface.\n\nA previous sounding rocket launch from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.

White Sands, a largely empty desert, is ideal.\n\nHerde, who spent four years working on the rocket, expressed her immense excitement for the launch. “This has been my baby.”\n\nBy Harper Lawson\n\nNASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.",

        "content": "Dragon Endeavour comes in for docking at 10:16 a.m. EDT Sunday. Photo Credit: NASA\n\nRiding aboard a spacecraft they christened “Endeavour”—in honor of the now-retired shuttle which kicked off both of their astronauting careers more than a decade ago—NASA veterans Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken completed another milestone earlier today (Sunday, 31 May), with a smooth link-up at the International Space Station (ISS) at 10:16 a.m. EDT. In doing so, the Demo-2 flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon became the 99th human-carrying space vehicle to visit the multi-national orbital complex since STS-88 (another Endeavour) in December 1998.\n\nThirty-seven U.S. shuttle missions, 61 Russian Soyuz flights, the most recent of which launched in April, and now Demo-2, have transported 240 men and women to the station from 19 sovereign nations. But for the first time on Demo-2, they were launched not by a government, but by a commercial entity.\n\nBob Behnken and Doug Hurley, in dark-colored shirts, and Expedition 63 crewmen Anatoli Ivanishin, Ivan Vagner and Chris Cassidy participate in interviews soon after hatch opening on Sunday, 31 May. Photo Credit: NASA\n\nAfter more than a decade in development, Saturday’s successful 3:22 p.m. EDT liftoff of Demo-2 ended an almost nine-year hiatus in American capability to send its own astronauts into space, aboard its own spacecraft, atop its own rockets, and from its own soil, since the retirement of the shuttle fleet. Astonishingly, Expedition 63 Commander Chris Cassidy—the incumbent ISS skipper—managed to snap a photograph of the Falcon 9 booster on the pad just two minutes before liftoff as the station passed high above the Kennedy Space Center (KSC).\n\nHurley and Behnken’s view of the International Space Station (ISS) early Sunday, as they entered the Approach Ellipsoid. Photo Credit: NASA\n\nTwelve minutes after departing historic Pad 39A, the “Dragon Endeavour” separated from the second stage of its Falcon 9 booster and shortly thereafter its nose cone opened to reveal its navigation sensors and docking mechanism. Over the course of the next 19 hours, a series of five thruster “burns” were executed to gradually align the spacecraft’s orbital path with that of the ISS and Hurley briefly took control of his ship to evaluate its capabilities in a “far-field” manual mode. By Sunday morning, Dragon Endeavour was clearly visible as a steadily brightening black-and-white blob to cameras wielded by Cassidy, who had earlier radioed warm greetings to the newcomers.\n\nVideo Credit: AmericaSpace\n\nHurley and Behnken, who provided an on-orbit video tour of Dragon Endeavour a few hours after liftoff, were awakened at 4:45 a.m. EDT Sunday to the strains of Black Sabbath’s “Planet Caravan”. At 8:11 a.m. EDT, the roughly 90-second-long Approach Initiation burn was executed to bring the spacecraft within the ISS Approach Ellipsoid in order to reach Waypoint Zero, the first of three waypoints at 1,300 feet (400 meters) “below” the station. They passed smoothly through a total of three waypoints—the others were Waypoint One at 720 feet (220 meters) and Waypoint Two 66 feet (20 meters)—and Hurley took manual control of Dragon Endeavour for the second time whilst in close proximity to the ISS.\n\nHurley (left) and Behnken are pictured aboard Dragon Endeavour during rendezvous operations. Photo Credit: NASA\n\nThroughout the rendezvous, the crew worked at least 16-17 minutes ahead of the timeline and it came as little surprise that docking, originally planned for 10:29 a.m. EDT, came a few minutes earlier. Reaching Waypoint Two, a hold was called for a “Go/No-Go” poll for final approach and docking. Contact and capture between Dragon Endeavour and International Docking Adapter (IDA)-2 at the forward end of the station’s Harmony node came at 10:16 a.m. EDT, as the combined vehicles flew 262 miles (421 km) over the border between China and Mongolia.\n\nFor the first time in almost nine years, the United States has regained crew access to the ISS. Photo Credit: NASA\n\n“Dragon, arriving,” exulted Cassidy, with the traditional bell-ring to observe the arrival of a new crew. “The crew of Expedition 63 in honored to welcome Dragon and the Commercial Crew Program. Bob and Doug, glad to have you as part of the crew.”\n\nVideo Credit: AmericaSpace\n\nTwo hours later, following pressurization and leak checks between the two spacecraft, Cassidy opened the hatch into IDA-2 at 12:37 p.m. EDT as they orbited 267 miles (430 km) over the South Pacific. And at 1:02 p.m. EDT, on the Dragon Endeavour side, Hurley opened his ship’s hatch to give American astronauts direct crew access to the ISS from an American spacecraft for the first time in almost nine years. Behnken came floating through the hatch first and was quickly engulfed in hugs from Cassidy and Russian Expedition 63 cosmonauts Anatoli Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner. Interestingly, both Cassidy and Behnken are former chiefs of NASA’s astronaut corps and today marked the first time in history that two ex-chiefs have met in low-Earth orbit.\n\nDoug Hurley assists Bob Behnken with the helmet of his Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) during pre-flight spacewalk training. Photo Credit: NASA\n\nIt remains to be seen exactly how long Hurley and Behnken will remain aboard the ISS, although it is understood that they will return to Earth about a month before the scheduled 30 August launch of Crew One—the first Post-Certification Mission (PCM) of Crew Dragon, carrying NASA astronauts Mike Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker, together with Soichi Noguchi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). That suggests an undocking and return of Dragon Endeavour in the late July timeframe, about eight weeks from now.\n\nOfficial Demo-2 mission emblem. Image Credit: NASA/SpaceX\n\nThe recent arrival of Japan’s H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV)-9 brought with it the final set of lithium-ion batteries to upgrade the space station’s S-6 truss segment from its original nickel-hydrogen batteries. A set of four spacewalks are on tap this summer to replace the batteries, together with at least one other Extravehicular Activity (EVA) to complete the installation of the Bartolomeo payloads-anchoring platform and the Columbus Ka-band Antenna (Col-KA) onto Europe’s Columbus lab. Earlier this year, following the decision to potentially extend Demo-2 from a two-week test flight to a multi-month ISS stay, Behnken received additional EVA training and Hurley received robotics training to support this work. “No formal assignment for the spacewalks have been made,” NASA’s Dan Huot told AmericaSpace early last week. “Likely would not until after the Demo-2 crew arrives.”\n\nVideo Credit: AmericaSpace\n\nAnd whilst Hurley and Behnken will work as part of the Expedition 63 crew—and Cassidy joked that missing their original 27 May launch date meant they missed out on Saturday morning cleaning duties—they do have a number of important tests associated with Crew Dragon.\n\nCassidy works inside IDA-2, ahead of Sunday’s hatch opening. Photo Credit: NASA\n\nAccording to Mr. Huot, these tests fall into several key areas. Hurley and Behnken will periodically “reawaken” Dragon Endeavour from its quiescent mode and execute procedures to establish an emergency safe haven. As part of this end, they will evaluate and configure all emergency hardware inside the spacecraft to prepare for a fast-response safe haven if needed. They will perform docked audio evaluations to the U.S. Operational Segment (USOS) and the Russian Operational Segment (ROS), evaluate the wifi signal strength from ISS routers to determine if SpaceX and NASA devices can access wireless networks aboard Dragon Endeavour.

However, it is expected that Cassidy and one or both of the cosmonauts may participate in the tests relating to the overall habitability of Crew Dragon and its functionality to support future missions of up to four astronauts. “Tests will be largely executed by Bob and Doug,” explained Mr. Huot. “Other crew will be tapped if needed.”\n\nFOLLOW AmericaSpace on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nPosts associated with the ISS missions After Daylong Delay, NG-20 Cygnus Launches, Heads to Space Station After Four-Month-Plus Stay, NG-19 Cygnus Cargo Ship Leaves Space Station Last Antares 200-Series Rocket Launches, Delivers NG-19 Cygnus to Space Station Northrop Grumman Prepares for Final Antares 230 Launch Tomorrow Northrop Grumman Launches NG-18 Cygnus to Space Station, Honors Pioneer Sally Ride NG-17 Cygnus Departs Space Station, Wraps Up Four-Month Stay CRS-24 Dragon Launches, Heads to Space Station NG-16 Cygnus Departs Space Station, Heads for Re-entry NG-16 Cygnus Launches, Honors Challenger Veteran, Heads to Space Station NG-16 Cygnus Prepares for Tuesday Launch, as OFT-2 Starliner Delay Lengthens Next Cygnus Cargo Ship Named for Challenger Hero Ellison Onizuka Station Crew Readies for Tuesday Cygnus Departure, NG-16 Launch NET 10 August As CRS-22 Readies for Thursday Launch, SpaceX, AxiomSpace Plan for Four Missions Through 2023 SpaceX, ULA Primed for Five Launches in June, CRS-22 Dragon Set to Fly Thursday Crew-2 Launches, Takes Aim on Space Station for Saturday Arrival SpaceX Static-Fires Falcon 9 for Crew-2, As Boeing OFT-2 Mission Aims for Aug-Sept Launch Crew-2 Astronauts Discuss Upcoming Mission, Eye 20 April Launch to ISS Northrop Grumman Green-Lights Two More Cygnus Missions, As NG-15 Arrives at Space Station ISS-Bound NG-15 Cygnus Honors ‘Hidden Figure’ Katherine Johnson Multi-National Crew-2 Gears Up for 20 April Launch to Space Station NG-14 Cygnus Departs Space Station, Two Weeks of Autonomous Fire Safety, Tech Experiments Ahead NG-14 Cygnus Arrives at Space Station, Ahead of Expedition 64 Launch Next Week Antares Breaks Launch Week Curse, as SpaceX Suffers Last-Second Scrub Scrub Week Continues, Antares Launch Now NET Friday Night Next NASA, SpaceX Crew Launch Set for Oct 31 with ‘Crew-1’ NG-14 Cygnus Readies for Tuesday Night Launch From Wallops Next Cygnus Cargo Ship Named for Columbia Astronaut Kalpana Chawla Second-Heaviest Cygnus, Antares Booster Processing Ramps Up for NG-14 Mission Next Cygnus Supply Mission Targets 29 Sept Launch to Space Station Rubins, Crewmates Discuss Upcoming Space Station Mission Demo-2 Docks at Space Station, Expedition 63 Expands to Five Crew T-1 Day: NASA, SpaceX Ready to Bring Human Spaceflight Back to America (Part 2) NASA, SpaceX Ready to Return Human Spaceflight to American Soil (Part 1) Astronauts Arrive in Florida for Launch Next Week on SpaceX Demo-2 Mission Starlink Mission Slips to NET June;

        "content": "Final Years NASA canceled all of its nuclear propulsion and power programs in December 1972, resulting in the closure of of the Rocket Systems Area.\n\nOverview\n\nThe steady reduction of NASA’s budget in the late 1960s and early 1970s coincided with the agency’s decision to develop the space shuttle. NASA shelved other major programs, such as a space station and long-duration human journeys to other planets. This eliminated the near-term need for a nuclear rocket. In December 1972, NASA canceled all of its nuclear propulsion and power programs, resulting in the closure of Plum Brook Station [today, the Neil Armstrong Test Facility].\n\nThere was very little activity at Plum Brook until the late 1980s when Lewis Research Center reactivated four test sites and resumed testing. The center did not bring the Rocket Systems Area sites, which had fallen into disrepair during the interim, back online. In the 2010s, NASA demolished the Rocket Systems Area as part of the agency’s effort to eliminate its unused structures. Plum Brook Station, however, continues to support NASA and industry with its four large test facilities today.\n\nPlum Brook Station Closure\n\nNeither the Atomic Energy Commission nor NASA Lewis had been given any indication that the nuclear propulsion program would be cancelled until the budget was officially announced on January 5, 1973. It was 1 year to the day after the approval of the shuttle and just 17 days after the splashdown of the final Apollo mission. Lewis Director Bruce Lundin traveled to Plum Brook that day to personally inform the staff that the station would be closed down. Activities at the reactor were terminated immediately, and the other facilities would shut down by fiscal year 1974.\n\nEngineers carefully deactivated the facilities in such a way that they could be restored in the future. This included de-energizing electrical systems, deactivating boilers, shutting down gas systems, depressurizing air service, etc. Technically, this allowed the mothballed test stands to be reactivated within 3 months. Meanwhile Plum Brook continued worked to complete several tests during this period, including testing of the Centaur Standard Shroud for the upcoming Viking mission.\n\nBy May 1974, the staff had mothballed all of the Rocket Systems Area sites. Some staff members found new positions at Lewis, but hundreds of others were soon out of work. Lewis set up a job placement office at Plum Brook to assist those affected. Lewis management also actively solicited other agencies and institutions to use Plum Brook for their test programs. The job placement activities went well, but the attempts to elicit outside interest in Plum Brook failed.\n\nDocuments\n\nMembers of the Rocket Systems Division’s Instrumentation and Controls Service Team in the B Control Building.

(1967) NASA/DON PERDUE\n\nStandby Years\n\nBy 1975, there were only a handful of NASA employees left at Plum Brook Station to supervise the contractors that maintained the facilities. Other Federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, and the Department of the Interior, set up offices in the empty Engineering Building. The center’s continued efforts to entice outside groups to utilize the inactive facilities remained ineffective. By the late 1970s, NASA decided to continue the maintenance of the reactor, Space Power Facility (SPF), Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility (B–2), Cryogenic Propellant Tank Facility (K Site), and the Hypersonic Tunnel Facility (HTF), but ceased protecting the other Rocket Systems Area sites.\n\nIn the 1970s the center expanded the scope of its work into new areas, such as renewable energy sources. As a result, Lewis partnered with the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) to construct a series of experimental large horizontal axis wind turbines. The first was a 100-kW experimental wind turbine at Plum Brook that Lewis researchers erected and operated. Between 1975 and 1985, the researchers investigated several different configurations on the machine. NASA and ERDA constructed larger wind turbines at other sites around the country to study the integration of wind energy into the local power grids. The program demonstrated several technologies employed by large wind turbines today. Overall, however, Plum Brook remained quiet.\n\nDocuments\n\nThe 100-kw wind turbine at Plum Brook Station with its original steel truss tower.

(2007) NASA/QUENTIN SCHWINN\n\nDemolition of the Sites\n\nIn 1985, the Office of Management and Budget recommended that NASA relinquish control of Plum Brook Station. A multiagency commission, however, reviewed the assessment and came to a different conclusion. They called on NASA to restore the test facilities at Plum Brook and resume operation. Lewis reactivated the B–2 vacuum chamber in 1987, SPF and K Site in 1988, and the HTF in 1993. The reactor and Rocket Systems Area remained shuttered. In 2007, the Cryogenic Components Laboratory replaced K Site.\n\nIn 2004, NASA began funding the demolition of unused facilities across the agency. Glenn began making plans to remove a number of its old test sites, including the Rocket Systems Area at Plum Brook. The sites, which had been exposed to the elements for years, were beyond restoration. In addition, safety officials considered several sites to be hazards. In November 2004, the Dynamics Stand (E Stand) became the first to fall. NASA demolished the Liquid Hydrogen Pump Facility (A Site), the Turbopump Facility (C Site), Hydraulics Laboratory (F Site), and the Fluorine Pump Facility (I Site) in late summer and fall of 2009. The Gas Handling Area was removed in March 2010, followed by the High Energy Rocket Engine Research Facility (B–1) and Nuclear Rocket Dynamics and Control Facility (B–3) facilities in fall 2010. The center completed the effort with the demolition of the H Control Building, K Site’s control building, and the J–5 hortonsphere in late 2012. In addition, the center decided to begin removing the Plum Brook Ordnance Works (PBOW) concrete bunkers that had stored munitions during World War II and NASA records and equipment in later years.\n\nDocuments\n\nRusting steam accumulators that were used to support the B-1 test stand at Plum Brook Station.

        "content": "Smaller spacecraft known as sounding rockets sometimes launch from New Mexico on scientific missions for NASA.\n\nA sounding rocket recently launched from White Sands, New Mexico, with equipment to study one of the most complex regions of the sun's atmosphere.\n\nNASA's sounding rocket program has been around for more than 40 years.\n\nStates like Florida, Texas and California are no strangers to routine rocket launches − but New Mexico?\n\nSpacecraft also sometimes get off the ground from the state.\n\nSpace news coverage may be headlined by crewed missions to the International Space Station from Cape Canaveral or SpaceX's latest test of its enormous Starship spacecraft from the Lonestar State.\n\nBut in the oft-overlooked state of New Mexico, smaller rockets often get off the ground from a NASA test site in the remote desert. The latest of the spacecraft, known as sounding rockets, most recently made a successful quick trip to space to study one of the most complex regions of the sun's atmosphere following a New Mexico launch.\n\nHere's everything to know about sounding rockets and the latest NASA mission from New Mexico near the Texas border.\n\nNASA launches sun-studying mission from White Sands, New Mexico\n\nThe latest sounding rocket mission in New Mexico got off the ground around 3 p.m. local time Friday, July 18, at NASA's White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico, located near the border of Texas about 60 miles north of El Paso.\n\nResidents in the local area around White Sands may have been able to spot the sounding rocket and its contrail when it launched, a NASA spokesperson confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nThe mission was expected to last no more than about 15 minutes, NASA said in a press release. After launching, the sounding rocket took about 90 seconds to reach space and point toward the sun, another eight minutes to conduct the experiment on the chromosphere, and no more than five minutes to return to Earth’s surface.\n\nUpon landing, the rocket was expected to drift between 70 to 80 miles from the launchpad so mission operators on the ground could ensure it would land safely in the large, empty desert, according to NASA.\n\nWhat are sounding rockets?\n\nNASA's sounding rocket program has for more than 40 years carried out missions to launch scientific instruments into space.\n\nSounding rockets are much smaller than an average spacecraft that may launch on an orbital flight from major spaceports like the Kennedy Space Center in Florida or the Vandenberg Space Force Base in Southern California.\n\nNASA's fleet of sounding rockets range anywhere in height from about 16 feet tall to about 70 feet tall. The Black Brant IX, the sounding rocket selected for the most recent launch from New Mexico, stands nearly 60 feet tall.\n\nFor comparison, SpaceX's famous two-stage Falcon 9 rocket – one of the world's most active for both human and cargo missions alike – stands at 230 feet tall when fully stacked. And the commercial spaceflight company's Starship megarocket, which is still in development, stands at an imposing 400-feet tall when both the crew capsule and Super Heavy rocket booster are integrated.\n\nBecause of their diminutive stature, NASA says soundings rockets are ideal for quick trips at lower speeds to regions of space that are too low for satellites and other spacecraft to conduct observations. And because sounding rockets don't require expensive boosters, missions costs also tend to be substantially less than other orbiter missions, according to the space agency.\n\nWhere does NASA launch sounding rockets? Missions occur in Virginia, Alaska, New Mexico\n\nOf the approximately 20 sounding rocket missions scheduled in the U.S. in 2025, most get off the ground from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia and the Poker Flat Research Range in Alaska.\n\nOccasionally, though, a sounding rocket will launch from a missile range at the White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico. Prior to July 18, the most recent mission at White Sands came Nov. 23, 2024, when NASA launched a Black Brant IX sounding rocket to test a spacecraft's performance in Earth's low-density magnetosphere.\n\nThe next sounding rocket mission is scheduled for Aug. 12 from Wallops Island in Virginia, according to NASA.\n\nSpacecraft studied solar chromosphere\n\nFor the latest mission from White Sands, a Black Brant IX sounding rocket carried new technology to study the sun's mysterious chromosphere, located between the sun's visible surface, known as the photosphere, and its outer layer, the corona.\n\nThe corona, which became widely visible from Earth in April 2024 during a total solar eclipse, is a region where powerful solar flares and coronal mass ejections can erupt to cause space weather that can disrupt Earthly technologies.\n\nNASA's SNIFS mission aimed to learn more about these events by observing how energy is converted and moves through the chromosphere to power such explosions.\n\nThe mission was the first to carry technology combining a standard imager to capture photos and videos with a spectrograph, which dissects light into its various wavelengths, according to NASA. This reveals which elements are present in the imaged light source.\n\nEric Lagatta is the Space Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network. Reach him at elagatta@gannett.com",

        "content": "Nineteen hours after a spectacular Florida launch, SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule caught up with the International Space Station early Sunday and glided in for a problem-free docking, bringing veteran astronauts Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken to the outpost in SpaceX's first piloted space flight.\n\nThe historic mission marks a major milestone in NASA's push to end the agency's sole reliance on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for carrying astronauts to and from the lab complex, the first piloted launch to orbit by a privately owned and operated spacecraft since the dawn of the space age.\n\nThe Crew Dragon capsule on final approach to the International Space Station. NASA TV\n\n\"Welcome to Bob and Doug,\" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said to the crew in a call from mission control at the Johnson Space Center. \"The whole world saw this mission, and we are so, so proud of everything you've done for our country and, in fact, to inspire the world.\"\n\n\"We sure appreciate that, sir,\" Hurley replied, floating in the space station's Harmony module, flanked by crewmate Behnken, space station commander Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner.\n\n\"It's obviously been our honor to be just a small part of this,\" he said. \"We have to give credit to SpaceX, the Commercial Crew Program and, of course, NASA. It's great to get the United States back in the crewed launch business, and we're just really glad to be on board this magnificent complex.\"\n\nFollowing a picture-perfect climb to space Saturday atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, Hurley and Behnken monitored an automated rendezvous with the station Sunday, approaching the lab complex from behind and below.\n\nExecuting a precise series of thruster firings, the Crew Dragon looped up to a point directly in front of the station and lined up on the lab's forward docking port, the same one once used by visiting space shuttles.\n\nHurley, a former Marine test pilot, briefly took over manual control, firing thrusters by tapping high-tech touch-screen cockpit displays to verify a crew's ability to fly the spacecraft by hand if needed.\n\nThe ship's flight computer than resumed the approach and the Crew Dragon's docking mechanism engaged its counterpart on the space station at 10:16 a.m. ET, about 15 minutes ahead of schedule. A few minutes later, the capsule was pulled in and locked in place by 12 motorized latches.\n\nThe combined Expedition 63 crew, back row, L-R: cosmonaut Anatoly Ivanishin, space station commander Chris Cassidy, cosmonaut Ivan Vagner; front row, L-R: Crew Dragon joint operations commander Robert Behnken and vehicle commander Douglas Hurley. The American flag on the hatch above the astronauts first flew in space on the shuttle Columbia's maiden flight in 1981; it was left aboard the station by Hurley and his Atlantis crewmates during the last shuttle mission in 2011. Hurley and Behnken plan to bring the flag home at the end of their current mission. NASA TV\n\nCassidy, a former Navy SEAL, followed naval tradition and rang the ship's bell aboard the station to announce the Crew Dragon's arrival.\n\n\"Dragon, arriving,\" he said. \"The crew of Expedition 63 is honored to welcome Dragon and the Commercial Crew Program to ... the International Space Station. Bob and Doug, glad to have you as part of the crew. Well done. Bravo zulu.\"\n\n\"We here at SpaceX are honored to have been part of ushering in this new era of human spaceflight,\" said Anna Menon, the spacecraft communicator at SpaceX's Hawthorne, California, control center. \"On behalf of the SpaceX and NASA partnership, congratulations on a phenomenal accomplishment. And welcome to the International Space Station.\"\n\nDuring the post-docking welcome aboard ceremony, Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas asked the Crew Dragon astronauts \"how does she handle?\"\n\n\"It flew just like it was supposed to,\" Hurley said. \"We had a couple of opportunities to take it out for a spin, so to speak (flying manually), and my compliments to the folks back at Hawthorne and SpaceX for how well it flew. It's exactly like the simulator, and we couldn't be happier about the performance of the vehicle.\"\n\nA camera mounted in the Crew Dragon capsule looks over the shoulders of astronauts Douglas Hurley, left, and Robert Behnken, right, showing the ship's high-tech touchscreen displays in the moments after docking with the International Space Station. NASA TV\n\nRepresentative Brian Babin, a Texas Republican who represents the Johnson Space Center, asked the astronauts to describe their impressions of launching atop a Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nBehnken, who flew twice aboard the space shuttle, recalled a fairly rough ride on the orbit while its two solid-fuel boosters were firing, but a smooth ascent after that with the shuttle's three liquid-fueled engines.\n\nHe and Hurley expected the Falcon 9 ride to smooth out after the rocket's first stage, powered by nine engines and generating 1.7 million pounds of thrust, was jettisoned about two-and-a-half minutes into flight. The Falcon's second stage is powered by a single engine.\n\n\"We were surprised a little bit by how smooth things were off the pad,\" Behnken said. \"The space shuttle was a pretty rough ride heading into orbit with the solid rocket boosters, and our expectation was as we continued with (our) flight into second stage, that things would basically get a lot smoother than the space shuttle.\n\n\"But Dragon was huffin' and puffin' all the way into orbit, and we were definitely riding a Dragon all the way up,\" he said. \"So it was not quite the same ride, the smooth ride as the space shuttle was up to MECO [main engine cutoff], a little bit less Gs but a little bit more 'alive' is probably the best way I could describe it.\"\n\nThe Crew Dragon is expected to remain docked to the station for six weeks to four months, allowing Behnken and Hurley to help Cassidy with a full slate of NASA and partner agency research and, possibly, with one or more spacewalks to install new solar array batteries and complete installation of a European experiment platform.\n\nNASA astronauts Bob Behnken, right, and Doug Hurley give a thumbs-up on their way to the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with the Crew Dragon spacecraft at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, on May 30, 2020. Getty\n\nCassidy said he looked forward to the help.\n\n\"We've got a few things to take care of tonight, make sure we're all safe and we know the plan in case something bad happens,\" he said, referring to a standard emergency briefing given to all newly arrived crew members.\n\n\"And then we're looking forward to some operational stuff later in the month, maybe we'll get outside and do some spacewalks. So we're all super excited to have two more crewmates to the Expedition 63 team.\"\n\nNASA originally planned a short one-week to 10-day test flight for the first piloted Crew Dragon. But delays in the agency's Commercial Crew Program and scaled-back production of Russian Soyuz spacecraft forced NASA to reduce the lab's U.S. and partner agency crew to just one — Cassidy.\n\nNASA managers are holding off on making a decision on when the Crew Dragon will return to Earth until they get a better idea of how atomic oxygen in the extreme upper atmosphere might affect the capsule's solar cells.\n\nNo matter how that works out, engineers want time to thoroughly evaluate the capsule's performance before proceeding with the first operational flight. NASA and SpaceX hope to launch that flight, carrying an international three-man one-woman crew, in the late August timeframe.",

        "content": "ORLANDO, Fla. — When two NASA astronauts lift off aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on their way to the International Space Station, the mission will open up a new era of crewed space flight. Here are a few things to know about the mission and the spacecraft.\n\n1. The astronauts will have space — literally.\n\nThe Crew Dragon capsule is roomy compared with the Freedom 7 capsule that Alan Shepard had to squeeze into when he became the first American in space in 1961. At almost 27 feet tall and with a diameter of 13 feet, the Crew Dragon towers over the Freedom 7's 11.5-foot height. The Freedom 7 could only carry one person and was only a little over 6 feet at its widest point. Meanwhile, Crew Dragon, which can carry seven people, is more than 10 times heavier than its predecessor at 26,576 pounds.\n\nFor this first crewed test mission of the Crew Dragon, dubbed Demo-2, there will be two NASA astronauts aboard, Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, plus some supplies.\n\n2. \"The worm\" is back.\n\nThe dark blue globe logo for NASA, dubbed the \"meatball,\" may be the agency's primary symbol these days, but if you're of Generation X or older, you may remember \"the worm\": the letters NASA spelled out in curvy, red pipes. The worm was created by the firm of Danne & Blackburn, according to NASA, and introduced in 1975. The now retro-looking logo was even honored by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, NASA says.\n\nThe worm logo was retired in 1992, but you can still find it on some souvenir items — and now, honored on the Falcon 9 rocket that will carry the Crew Dragon during the Demo-2 flight. NASA says we may also see it sprinkled about in other official ways on this mission and possibly going forward.\n\nNASA says the meatball will continue to be its main logo, but the worm will live on in other ways. Look for it on the Falcon 9 rocket.\n\n3. The Crew Dragon is fully autonomous.\n\nThat means the capsule can be monitored and controlled not just by the astronauts inside, but also SpaceX’s mission control in California. There are a few buttons and knobs, but most of the controls inside the capsule are touchscreens. Besides carrying the crew, the capsule also houses Draco thrusters. These engines allow the capsule to maneuver in space. Additional Draco thrusters are under the nose cone, along with the Guidance Navigation and Control sensors.\n\n4. Two sides to the capsule.\n\nThe Crew Dragon is made up of two parts: The pressurized capsule, which carries the astronauts and any critical cargo, and the unpressurized service module, also known as the trunk.\n\nThe trunk is the connection between the Dragon and the Falcon 9 rocket, which will lift off from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center. Half of the trunk contains a solar array, which will provide power to the Dragon while in orbit; the other half has a radiator that ejects heat.\n\n5. There's a backup crew.\n\nIn case something were to prevent Behnken and/or Hurley from being a part of the Demo-2 mission, there are other astronauts to take their place. U.S. Air Force Col. Michael Hopkins would replace Hurley as spacecraft commander while U.S. Navy Cmdr. Victor Glover would replace Behnken as the joint operations commander. If the Demo-2 mission is a success, Hopkins and Glover, along with NASA astronaut Shannon Walker and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Soichi Noguchi, will be assigned to Crew-1, the beginning of SpaceX's regular crew rotation missions to the space station.\n\nInteractive Timeline: Crew Dragon Milestones",

        "content": "Rocketry Club Wins Innovation Award at NASA Student Launch Challenge\n\nUToday, Alumni, Engineering By Nicki Gorny July 22, 2025 | News\n\nEven a crash landing couldn’t keep them down.\n\nWhen The University of Toledo Rocketry Club competed in NASA’s 25th annual Student Launch Challenge in late April and early May, a twisted parachute grounded their rocket ahead of its final launch. But they were excited to walk away with the NASA Artemis Student Challenge Innovation Award, recognizing the design of the scientific payload system that they call the E.P.I.C. Payload Capsule.\n\nE.P.I.C. standing for Electronics Plus Internal Cooling.\n\n“It’s like winning the Super Bowl,” said Mike Vargas, a master’s student in mechanical engineering who led his peers in the design and execution of the payload system. “It feels like we’re the national champions at making payloads. We were competing against the top schools in the country, and we had the most innovative design.”\n\nThe NASA Student Launch Challenge tasks student teams across the country with designing, building, testing and launching a high-powered rocket carrying a scientific or engineering payload. It’s an intensive nine-month process, with teams required to submit formal reports and presentations along the way, and it culminates in a national competition outside Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nNASA tweaks the criteria for the rocket and payload each year, with this year’s teams challenged to design a payload capable of sending at least three data points from their rockets to a ground-based mission control.\n\nVargas and his teammates went above and beyond with a capsule capable of reporting all eight suggested data points. Inspired by SpaceX’s Dragon spacecrafts, it opens both vertically and horizontally to allow full-circle access to internal electronics, including sensors and high-resolution cameras that record data like apogee and velocity; a cooling system that ensures everything functions as designed; and an omnidirectional antenna and radio transmitter that allows them to report their data points to mission control.\n\nData is reported via voice transmission, rather than the simpler Morse code, Vargas noted.\n\n“The voice transmission is pretty significant,” he said. “It really took a lot of time to develop the hardware and the programming to convert our data into voice transmission.”\n\nThe club recently received their NASA Artemis Student Challenge Innovation Award, which includes a flag flown aboard the Artemis 1 mission in 2022. It’s now proudly displayed inside their workspace in the North Engineering Building.\n\n“I wish that our rocket would have qualified and that we could have had a shot at winning the whole thing, because we really had an amazing team this year,” said Vargas, who will lead the team as president in the 2025-26 academic year. “But we still were able to go to the competition. We still were able to work together and learn new things. This has been the most valuable hands-on experience I’ve had so far at UToledo.”",

        "content": "Two veteran NASA astronauts rocketed away from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday to begin a test flight of a new commercial spaceship designed, built and owned by SpaceX.\n\nThe long-awaited return of human spaceflight to the Florida spaceport marked just the fifth time in U.S. history that astronauts flew into orbit on a new type of spacecraft, and the first time since the inaugural space shuttle launch in 1981.\n\nWith spacecraft commander Doug Hurley in the left seat and veteran astronaut Bob Behnken to his right, SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft lifted off from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 3:22:45 p.m. EDT (1922:45 GMT) Saturday.\n\nNine minutes later, the astronauts were in orbit, ending a nearly decade-long gap in U.S. human spaceflight capability that forced NASA to pay the Russian space agency for rides to the space station on Soyuz spaceships.\n\nA previous launch attempt Wednesday was canceled due to the threat of lightning, and stormy weather again threatened Saturday’s countdown.\n\nBut a wave of showers and thunderstorms pushed through the spaceport and skies cleared sufficiently to allow the 215-foot-tall (65-meter) Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule to take off at Saturday’s instantaneous launch opportunity, a one-second window determined by the location of the space station’s orbital track.\n\nWatch a replay of liftoff! pic.twitter.com/yv1Sw7I80z — Spaceflight Now (@SpaceflightNow) May 30, 2020\n\nHurley and Behnken put on their white SpaceX-made pressure suits at NASA’s crew quarters Saturday, then rode a Tesla Model X car to pad 39A a few miles away. Once the astronauts arrived at the historic seaside launch complex — the departure point for all of NASA’s Apollo moon landing missions, and the first and last space shuttle flights — they rode an elevator up the tower and walked across a 50-foot (15-meter) access warm to board the Crew Dragon capsule.\n\nA half-dozen SpaceX engineers wearing dark jumpsuits and masks helped Hurley and Behnken into their seats, then closed the Dragon’s hatch and evacuated the launch pad before the Falcon 9 was fueled for liftoff.\n\nNine Merlin 1D main engines powered the Falcon 9 northeast from the Kennedy Space Center with 1.7 million pounds of thrust, then a single Merlin upper stage engine tuned to fire in the vacuum of space propelled the Crew Dragon spacecraft into orbit.\n\nSoon after the upper stage engine shut down, the Crew Dragon separated from the Falcon 9. Cameras mounted outside the rocket and inside the Dragon spacecraft beamed down live views throughout the climb into orbit, including video from inside the cockpit.\n\nThe spectacular imagery showed Hurley and Behnken in their flight suits as they soared into space. At eye-level, a three-panel touchscreen graphic display let the astronauts know where they were during ascent.\n\nWatch the Crew Dragon with astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken aboard separate from the Falcon 9 upper stage.

The crowds allowed on NASA property were significantly smaller, with limitations on the number of media representatives and VIPs present to see the historic crew launch.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence attended the launch, and Trump gave remarks inside NASA’s Vehicle Assembly Building later Saturday.\n\nThe successful launch Saturday was a milestone for NASA, with the restoration of crew access to low Earth orbit from U.S. soil. The nine-year gap since the last shuttle mission in 2011 was the longest span of time since the first U.S. human spaceflight in 1961 that NASA did not have a way to send crews into space on domestic rockets.\n\nHurley, a retired Marine Corps colonel who hails from Upstate New York, is the spacecraft commander on the Crew Dragon test flight, designated Demo-2, or DM-2. His responsibilities include launch, landing and recovery operations.\n\nBehnken is the joint operations commander for the Demo-2 test flight. The 49-year-old Missouri native will be responsible for activities once aboard the International Space Station.\n\n“Enjoy your new spaceship,” radioed Jason Aranha, a spacecraft communicator at SpaceX’s mission control in Hawthorne, California.\n\n“We are definitely doing that,” replied Hurley a couple of hours after launch. “It’s been a spectacular spaceship so far. Congrats to the Dragon teams, and obviously everybody there in Hawthorne that’s done all this work to get us up here.\n\n“It was quite a ride,” Hurley said. “Everybody go home and kind of remember this moment. It’s been pretty incredible.”\n\nHear Dragon commander Doug Hurley’s message to the SpaceX mission control team in Hawthorne, California. “It’s been a spectacular spaceship so far,” Hurley says. LIVE COVERAGE: https://t.co/1DF5tRjUzj pic.twitter.com/UPn5kX9Geb — Spaceflight Now (@SpaceflightNow) May 30, 2020\n\nHurley later completed a manual flight test to demonstrate the crew’s ability to command manual inputs to the Crew Dragon’s flight control system. The spacecraft is designed to operate autonomously, and is scheduled to use the autopilot mode for docking with the space station at 10:29 a.m. EDT (1429 GMT) Sunday.\n\nThe astronauts also downlinked live video from inside the spacecraft before beginning an eight-hour sleep.\n\nHurley and Behnken announced they are naming the capsule “Endeavour” after the retired NASA space shuttle. The spacecraft is the third crew vehicle in the U.S. space program to be named Endeavour, after the Apollo 15 command module and shuttle orbiter.\n\n“Without further ado, we would like to welcome you aboard capsule Endeavour,” Hurley said. “We chose Endeavour for a few reasons — one because of this incredible endeavor NASA, SpaceX and the United States have been on since the end of the shuttle program back in 2011.\n\n“The other reason we named it Endeavour is a little more personal to Bob and I,” Hurley continued. “We both had our first flights on shuttle Endeavour, and it just meant so much for us to carry on that name.”\n\nBut this Endeavour is different than the past space vehicles that carried the name. Instead of being a government-owned spaceship, the Crew Dragon is owned by SpaceX. And it’s controlled by SpaceX engineers in Southern California, not by NASA controllers and contractors in Houston.\n\nThe change is a significant step toward the commercialization of spaceflight, a strategic objective of NASA, which says the change will bring about lower costs and more innovation in the space transportation industry.\n\nNASA is looking to incorporate commercial elements in its architecture to return humans to the lunar surface. The agency last month announced SpaceX and two other companies won contracts to advance development of human-rated lunar lander vehicles.\n\nThe launch of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft Saturday was a turning point for SpaceX, the once-upstart space company founded in 2002 by billionaire Elon Musk. It comes after years of development, including delays caused by funding shortfalls in congressional budgets and technical setbacks, including a pair of issues in the last year involving the crew capsule’s launch abort system and parachutes.\n\nMusk said he was “quite overcome with emotion” after the Dragon launch Saturday.\n\n“It’s been 18 years working toward this goal, so it’s hard to believe that it’s happening,” Musk said. “We haven’t quite yet docked safely with the space station, and of course, we need to bring them back safely, and we need to repeat these missions and have this be a regular occurrence. So there’s a lot of work to do.”\n\nNevertheless, Musk and NASA officials were in celebratory mood after Saturday’s launch.\n\n“It’s been nine years since we’ve launched American astronauts on American rockets from American soil, and now we have done it again,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine.\n\nThe Demo-2 astronauts will live and work on the International Space Station for one-to-four months before coming back to Earth for a parachute-assisted splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean just east of Cape Canaveral. The final duration of their test flight will be primarily determined by the performance of the capsule’s solar arrays in orbit, mission managers said earlier this month.\n\nHurley and Behnken were two of four NASA astronauts selected in 2015 to train for commercial crew missions on SpaceX and Boeing capsules. NASA assigned the two-man crew to the SpaceX Demo-2 mission in 2018.\n\nNASA has signed a series of funding agreements with SpaceX since 2011 valued at more than $3.1 billion. With NASA funding and technical oversight, SpaceX has developed the human-rated Crew Dragon spacecraft to launch on the company’s Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nBoeing has received a similar series of contracts from NASA — valued at more than $4.8 billion — to develop the Starliner crew capsule.\n\nBut those figures include NASA payments to the contractors to cover crew transportation services, once the Crew Dragon and Starliner vehicles are operational. Phil McAlister, NASA’s head of commercial spaceflight development, said May 13 that the space agency invested around $5 billion toward Crew Dragon and Starliner design and development.\n\nThe companies also put in an unspecified level of private funding, a requirement under the public-private partnership arrangement pursued by NASA’s commercial crew program since 2010.\n\nWith Saturday’s launch, SpaceX became the first private company to put people into orbit. The achievement follows SpaceX’s earlier milestones, such becoming the first private company to deliver cargo to the space station in 2012.\n\nSpaceX has also carved out a leading place in the global commercial launch industry, and is a trusted contractor to launch satellites for the U.S. military.\n\nBut SpaceX’s long-term vision — as laid out by Musk — is interplanetary space travel. And launching people into space is a core mission for the company.\n\nNASA and SpaceX received numerous congratulatory messages, including from Sergei Krikalev, a veteran cosmonaut who now needs human spaceflight programs at the Russian space agency.\n\nNASA has paid the Russian government approximately $3.9 billion since 2006 to purchase Soyuz seats for astronauts from the United States and the station’s other international partners, according to a report last year by NASA’s inspector general.\n\nMost recently, NASA agreed to pay the Russian government $90.2 million for a single Soyuz seat on a launch this October. The U.S. space agency decided to sign the agreement to guarantee access to the space station for a NASA crew member in the event of additional delays in the new U.S. crew capsules.\n\nAssuming Hurley and Behnken’s test flight goes according to plan, the first operational Crew Dragon launch is scheduled from the Kennedy Space Center no earlier than Aug. 30 with a four-person space station crew.\n\nBoeing’s Starliner spaceship — facing delays after a problem-plagued unpiloted test flight last December — will have to perform a second automated demonstration mission before it is cleared to fly astronauts. The Starliner’s crewed test flight to the space station is now expected in the first half of 2021.\n\nA report by the NASA inspector general last year concluded the space agency is paying roughly $55 million per round-trip seat on Crew Dragon missions, and $90 million for a Starliner ticket to the space station. Both capsules will typically carry four astronauts on missions to the International Space Stations.\n\nNASA expects to end payments to Russia once the new U.S. crew ships are operational. Under the space agencies’ current plans, U.S. astronauts will continue flying on Soyuz spacecraft and Russian cosmonauts will launch and land on the new U.S. vehicles under a barter arrangement, with no funds exchanged.\n\nBut Russian officials say they are not assigning cosmonauts to missions on U.S. vehicles until they are flight-proven.\n\nRussia’s partnership with NASA on the International Space Station program on a technical level has been an unqualified success. Without Russian spacecraft, U.S. astronauts could have not flown to and from the station in the wake of the space shuttle Columbia accident in 2003, or since the shuttle’s retirement in 2011.\n\nBut the political relationship has been tortured at times.\n\nOne low point came in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. That prompted the Obama administration to levy U.S. sanctions on Russian government entities, and some individuals, including then-Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin, who is now the head of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency.\n\nIn response to the sanctions, Rogozin suggested on Twitter in 2014 that the United States “deliver its astronauts to the ISS with a trampoline.”\n\n“The trampoline is working,” Musk joked Saturday.\n\nEmail the author.\n\nFollow Stephen Clark on Twitter: @StephenClark1.",

        "content": "Recently, NASA tested a payload adapter at the Marshall Space Flight Center as part of the preparation for the upcoming Artemis IV mission.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe massive, dark circular payload adapter was carefully lowered from Test Stand 4697 to Test Stand 4705 for storage, after successfully completing initial structural tests. The next stage is for flight engineers to run quality checks on the adapter before building the final device.\n\nThe payload adapter plays an important role in spacecraft launches, as it connects the spacecraft or satellite to a launch vehicle. Without an adapter, the two parts of the spacecraft can't interface.\n\nWhere is it?\n\nThe payload adapter was initially tested and is being stored at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nThe large payload adapter is moved via crane into storage. (Image credit: NASA/Sam Lott)\n\nWhy is it amazing?\n\nThe payload adapter is just one piece of equipment that is being tested as part of NASA's planned Artemis IV mission. This crewed lunar mission will focus on the first lunar space station, Gateway, according to NASA. The international hub will allow astronauts to study both the moon and the planets beyond, especially Mars.\n\nTo get the astronauts to Gateway, NASA plans to launch the crew using the Orion spacecraft with an upgraded SLS rocket. Before that happens, all launch materials, from boosters to payload adapters, have to be thoroughly tested and cleared for takeoff.\n\nWant to learn more?\n\nYou can read more about the upcoming Artemis IV mission and the Gateway hub on the moon.",

        "content": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAstronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley have successfully disembarked the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule and entered the International Space Station.\n\nSpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft docked at the space station at 10:16 a.m. ET Sunday morning after launching from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center Saturday and traveling 19 hours. After making initial contact with the ISS, Crew Dragon went through a series of steps to further mate the spacecraft with its port — including linking power and creating an air-locked seal — before the first of two hatches were opened.\n\nBehnken and Hurley are expected to remain on board the space station for one to three months, or for a maximum of 110 days.\n\nOn Sunday morning, the spacecraft made a careful approach to the space station and then made a “soft capture” — meaning Crew Dragon made its first physical contact with its docking port at the International Space Station. Crew Dragon then made a “hard capture,” which involved using 12 latches to create an air-locked seal between Behnken and Hurley’s crew cabin and their entrance to the space station and linked up Crew Dragon’s power supply to the ISS.\n\nSpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, carrying NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, splashes down into the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday, August 2.

Bill Ingalls/NASA Behnken and Hurley give a thumbs-up before being extracted from the Crew Dragon spacecraft. Bill Ingalls/NASA Boats swarm around the Crew Dragon shortly after splashdown. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said during a news conference that the Coast Guard was supposed to keep a large swath of ocean around the landing site clear but that some boats made a \"beeline\" for the capsule. In a statement on August 2, the Coast Guard said, \"With limited assets available and with no formal authority to establish zones that would stop boaters from entering the area, numerous boaters ignored the Coast Guard crews' requests and decided to encroach the area, putting themselves and those involved in the operation in potential danger.\" Bill Ingalls/NASA Hurley and Behnken prepare to undock from the International Space Station on Saturday, August 1. NASA/AP NASA tweeted this photo of Behnken and Hurley on Friday, July 30. NASA \"If the weather at our splashdown location is right, next week at this time @SpaceX's Crew Dragon Endeavour will no longer be docked to the front of @Space_Station,\" Behnken tweeted on Wednesday, July 29. \"My family is excited!\" NASA Hurley tweeted this photo of Behnken and Chris Cassidy on a spacewalk outside the International Space Station on July 21.

Charlie Riedel/AP In pictures: SpaceX's historic mission Prev Next\n\nBehnken and Hurley emerged, smiling, from the capsule around 1:15 pm ET. They were greeted by fellow NASA astronaut Christopher Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoli Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner, who were already on board the orbiting laboratory.\n\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine called the station from the space agency’s mission control center in Houston, Texas.\n\n“We are so, so proud of everything you’ve done for our country, and in fact, to inspire the world,” Bridenstine said.\n\nWhen asked about their 19-hour journey to the space station, Hurley said he “couldn’t be happier” about the performance of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon.\n\nThe astronauts were able to sleep for a few hours, share meals and use the on board toilet during their journey. “The Dragon was a slick vehicle, and we had good airflow, so we had an excellent, excellent evening,” Hurley said.\n\nCrew Dragon has a name: Endeavour\n\nAstronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley gave a tour of their Crew Dragon spacecraft using onboard cameras while the vehicle was making its way toward the International Space Station on Saturday evening.\n\nAnd they announced a name for the vehicle: Endeavour.\n\nThe astronauts picked that name for a few reasons, Hurley said on NASA and SpaceX’s webcast. On one hand, the name honors the years-long endeavor that was returning human spaceflight to the United States after the Space Shuttle retired in 2011. And it honors the longtime friendship that Hurley and Behnken have shared, and their histories with NASA: Both astronauts began their spaceflight careers with missions aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour. (That vehicle’s namesake was an 18th century ship commanded by British explorer James Cook — hence the British spelling of “Endeavour.”)\n\nSpecial cargo: A glittery dinosaur\n\nNASA and SpaceX already revealed that a couple of special artworks were aboard Crew Dragon with the astronauts. But livestream viewers spotted a small, sparkly dinosaur toy on board with Hurley and Behnken as well.\n\nDuring their update from orbit on Saturday, the astronauts shared what that was all about: They both have young sons who are big fans of dinosaurs, and the astronauts allowed their kids to vote on which of their toys would be stowed away on this mission.\n\nThe selection was a blue and pink, sequin-studded Apatosaurus.\n\nWhat this milestone means\n\nCrew Dragon and the astronauts have now made it through two major milestones — launch and docking — without encountering any major issues. That’s a huge win for SpaceX, which has been working toward this moment since the company was founded in 2002.\n\nIt’s also a point of celebration for NASA, which made the controversial decision to ask the private sector to design vehicles for transportation to the ISS after the Space Shuttle program retired in 2011. NASA has long partnered with the private sector, but it had never before handed over design, development and testing of a human-rated spacecraft to a commercial company.\n\nAfter delays, development hiccups and some political roadblocks, a successful first launch of astronauts will mark a huge win for folks within the space agency who hope to continue using more extensive commercial contracts. That includes for NASA’s ambitions to put people on the moon in 2024.",

        "content": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — SpaceX has begun a new chapter in the history of United States spaceflight.\n\nElon Musk's private space company on Saturday launched NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley into orbit, successfully beginning SpaceX's first crewed mission.

The capsule is the first privately designed and built spacecraft to carry astronauts to space and is bound for the International Space Station.\n\nBeyond the achievement for SpaceX, the launch represents the first time NASA has launched its own astronauts since the end of the space shuttle program nearly a decade ago.\n\n\"It was incredible,\" NASA astronaut Bob Behnken said of the launch, moments after the spacecraft reached orbit. \"Appreciate all the hard work and thanks for the great ride to space.\"\n\nKnown as Demo-2, the launch represents the culmination of SpaceX's work thus far. Musk founded the company in 2002 and has since declared its informal credo to be \"making humanity a multi-planetary species.\" To date, SpaceX has launched dozens of satellites and spacecraft but, before Saturday, it had never put a human in space.",

        "content": "Astronomy spoke with retired NASA astronauts Nicole Stott and Cady Coleman to get their thoughts on the upcoming SpaceX launch, as well as what it means for women.\n\nHearkening back to the Apollo era of the 1960s and 1970s, the next decade is sure to be packed with many historic missions, including sending the first woman to the Moon. So, unlike during the space race, women won’t be hidden behind the scenes . They’ll be on the front lines.\n\nSpaceX’s pioneering crewed mission will serve as a major milestone in the burgeoning era of private spaceflight. But this period will not be led by nations. Companies will pave the way. As private crewed launches become commonplace in the upcoming decades, more and more companies from around the world will push the technological horizon to explore our nearby cosmic neighborhood and beyond.\n\nSaturday’s planned SpaceX Crew Dragon launch will mark the beginning of a new chapter in human spaceflight. For the first time, a private aerospace company will launch two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). It’ll also be the first time Americans will launch from home turf since the end of the Space Shuttle Program in 2011.\n\nA new generation of spaceflight\n\nPeople around the world are waiting with bated breath as Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley prepare for Saturdays’ SpaceX launch — which got pushed back from Wednesday due to poor weather. When SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket, tipped with an occupied Crew Dragon capsule, lifts off from the historic Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, space fans will all be hoping for a successful launch.\n\nBut for Stott, this mission has an even greater meaning.\n\n“I am especially excited about the fact that Bob and Doug are two of my astronaut classmates from the class of 2000,” says Stott. “Their wives are [also] two of my classmates, so this feels like a family event happening.”\n\nStott went on two missions to the International Space Station during her 27-year career at NASA. She was also the last crew member to return home on the space shuttle Atlantis, which marked the temporary end of humans launched from within U.S. borders. But now, Stott’s excited all over again as she gets to follow her friends as they pioneer the next generation of spaceflight.\n\nColeman, who joined NASA in 1992, logged more than 179 days in space during her 24 years as an astronaut. But just like Stott, Coleman is looking forward to what using private spaceflight will mean long-term.\n\n“It’s really exciting because we’ve spent time designing and building together, and now we’re going to see if everything works the way we hoped it would.”\n\nIf Saturday’s mission goes off without a hitch, NASA will finally have an affordable, reusable option to ferry NASA astronauts and their international colleagues to the ISS. This would free up funding and time to focus on other missions, such as the upcoming launch of the Perseverance Mars rover this summer, a Moon landing in a few short years as part of the Artemis program, and an ambitious rotorcraft that hopes to fly just above the surface of Saturn’s largest moon Titan.\n\nSpaceX isn’t going to be the only game in town for long, though. Boeing is also working on a spacecraft that can carry NASA astronauts to orbit. The company is close to passing their final un-crewed test before they can bring humans into low Earth orbit. And once they pass, Boeing and SpaceX will continue to shuttle astronauts back and forth, expanding the research and science output of the ISS.\n\nThe future of women in space\n\nWhen NASA unveiled their plans for the Artemis program, they knew they were paying homage to the former Apollo program. After all, Artemis is the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology. This name, though, also hints that the next lunar landing will feature the first woman to walk on the surface of the Moon.\n\nNASA has promised that at least one of the astronauts returning to the Moon will be a woman, but Stott has another idea.\n\n“Why not make it two?” she says.\n\nWomen have always been a part of NASA but were usually kept behind the scenes. In recent decades, women took on larger roles as astronauts; however, it wasn’t until 2019 that the world saw the first all-female spacewalk.\n\nAnd the journey to this point wasn’t simple. Valentina Tereshkova, a Russian female cosmonaut, crossed the boundary of space in 1963. But it would take until 1983 before Americans finally sent astronaut Sally Ride into orbit.\n\nNow women serve at many high-level roles at NASA and are part of almost every mission on the ISS. “The rocket ship doesn’t care if you’re a boy or a girl,” Stott says.\n\nWhile there may not be any women on Saturday’s planned mission, there are a number of women working to make sure this launch goes smoothly. Plus, astronaut Nicole Mann has been assigned to the flight team of Boeing’s first crewed mission to the ISS, planned for later in 2020.\n\n“I think that NASA, in general, has done a really good job since women have been a part of the office of incorporating and assigning women to the missions,” says Stott.\n\nThis next decade will showcase the wonders of human innovation, as well as highlight what working together can achieve. During it, humanity will see the next generation of moonwalkers, as well as the development of a new wave of technology that will help us better explore our cosmic neighborhood.\n\n“I hope everybody is watching [the SpaceX launch Saturday],” says Stott. “I hope everybody realizes how meaningful this is to all of us.”\n\nYou can watch the historic launch, called “Launch America” on National Geographic or ABC on Saturday, May 30.

        "content": "“You have to learn those hard lessons, and I think sometimes the aerospace industry shies away from failure in the development phase—it looks bad politically, it’s tough, and the media certainly makes a lot out of failures,” SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell said ahead of the Demo-2 launch. “Candidly, I think that those beginnings and those roots are critically important to our success.”\n\nThe Right Stuff: Streaming This Fall on Disney+ Follow seven of the military’s best test pilots at the dawn of the U.S. space program as they train to become the first astronauts. The Right Stuff, a Disney+ Original Series based on the bestselling book by Tom Wolfe, is streaming soon on Disney+. (The Walt Disney Company is majority owner of National Geographic Partners.)\n\nTo date, the company has landed a Falcon 9 first stage 45 times, and it has launched 31 boosters that had already flown to space. One first stage launched five times before SpaceX failed to land it again.\n\n“We’re going to do it our own way, we’re not going to necessarily do it the old way,” the Smithsonian’s Levasseur says of SpaceX’s approach to spaceflight. “We’re able to change the shape of it ourselves, we’re able to change the way it works.”\n\nAfter taking people to the ISS, SpaceX is aiming for the moon and Mars. The company is currently designing and testing a new rocket called Starship—a vehicle that has blown up frequently during testing, most recently on May 29. NASA recently awarded SpaceX $135 million to develop Starship into a potential lunar lander.\n\n“We envision a future where low-Earth orbit is entirely commercialized—where NASA is one customer of many customers, where we have numerous providers that are competing on cost and innovation and safety,” says NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine. “It's an era in human spaceflight where more space is going to be available to more people than ever before.”",

        "content": "A satellite image shows stranded container ship Ever Given after it ran aground in Suez Canal, Egypt March 25, 2021. CNES Airbus DS | Reuters\n\nThe Ever Given, one of the world's largest container ships, is still wedged in the Suez Canal, and the economic effects from the blockage — now in its fourth day — are beginning to unfold. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Friday that the U.S. is monitoring the situation closely. \"We've offered U.S. assistance to Egyptian authorities to help reopen the canal...those conversations are ongoing,\" she said during a press briefing, before adding that there could be \"some potential impacts on energy markets.\" Oil prices jumped on Friday, amid speculation that dislodging the ship could take weeks. West Texas Intermediate crude futures and Brent crude each advanced more than 4%. The gains come after prices dipped on Thursday, despite the gridlock. \"Traders, in a change of heart, decided that the Suez Canal blockade is actually becoming more significant for oil flows and supply deliveries than they previously concluded,\" said Paola Rodriguez-Masiu, vice president of oil markets at Rystad Energy.\n\nA satellite image shows the Suez Canal blocked by the stranded container ship Ever Given in Egypt March 25, 2021, in this image obtained from Twitter page of Director General of Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin. Picture taken March 25, 2021. Roscosmos | Reuters\n\nOf the 39.2 million barrels per day of crude imported by seaborne methods in 2020, 1.74 million barrels per day passed through the Suez Canal, according to data from research firm Kpler. This represents under 5% of total flows, but as the build-up stretches on, the impacts rise. Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, the technical manager of the ship, said another attempt on Friday to re-float the cargo carrier proved unsuccessful. A specialized suction dredger that can shift 2,000 cubic meters of material every hour is now on the site, and \"arrangements are also being made for high-capacity pumps to reduce the water levels in the forward void space of the vessel and the bow thruster room,\" the firm said Friday.\n\nStranded container ship Ever Given, one of the world's largest container ships, is seen after it ran aground, in Suez Canal, Egypt March 26, 2021. Mohamed Abd El Ghany | Reuters\n\nBernhard Schulte added that two additional tugboats will arrive by Sunday to help in the re-float operation. Douglas Kent, executive vice president of strategy and alliances at the Association for Supply Chain Management, noted that even after the ship is dislodged the impacts will continue to be felt. Ships will arrive at ports simultaneously creating new traffic jams, for instance. Cargo schedules created months in advance will need to be reshuffled with ships now sitting in the wrong place. More importantly, there's a lack of visibility throughout the entire supply chain. \"The whole knock-on effect through the multi-hierarchy of the supply base — we're not going to know that,\" Kent said. \"Companies don't have visibility into their supply chain.\" While a company might know it has a product sitting on a ship that's stopped, the impact of delays down the line are unknown.\n\nAn excavator attempts to free stranded container ship Ever Given, one of the world's largest container ships, after it ran aground, in Suez Canal, Egypt March 25, 2021.

        "content": "July 17 (Reuters) – China is threatening to block the sale of more than 40 ports, owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, to BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) if Chinese shipping company Cosco does not get a stake, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing unnamed sources.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify the WSJ report.\n\nCK Hutchison, MSC, BlackRock and Cosco did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for a comment, while the Chinese government could not be immediately reached outside office hours.\n\nChinese officials have told BlackRock, MSC and Hutchison that if Cosco is left out of the deal, Beijing would take steps to block Hutchison’s proposed sale of the ports, the newspaper said.\n\nTycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison in March announced it would sell its 80% holding in the ports business, which encompasses 43 ports in 23 countries. The business has an enterprise value of $22.8 billion, including debt.\n\nAfter much scrutiny and criticism in China, Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison confirmed in May Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run MSC, one of the world’s top container shipping groups, was the main investor in a group seeking to buy the ports.\n\nBlackRock, MSC and Hutchison all are open to Cosco taking a stake, WSJ said.\n\nHowever, the parties would likely not reach a deal before a previously agreed upon July 27 deadline for exclusive talks between BlackRock, MSC and Hutchison, the report added.\n\nThe proposed sale has also drawn the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly expressed his desire to reduce Chinese influence around the Panama Canal and termed the deal a “reclaiming” of the waterway after it was first announced.\n\n(Reporting by Angela Christy and Mrinmay Dey in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)\n\n(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.",

        "content": "A view shows the container ship Ever Given, one of the world's largest container ships, after it was partially refloated, in Suez Canal, Egypt March 29, 2021. Suez Canal Authority | Reuters\n\nThe Ever Given was pulled free from the Suez Canal on Monday after cutting off traffic in the vital waterway for six days, but experts say the disruptions to global trade will continue to reverberate. \"We might celebrate the success of releasing the ship and unblocking the Suez, but that's not the end of the story here,\" said Douglas Kent, executive vice president of strategy and alliances at the Association for Supply Chain Management. \"It's definitely going to continue to backlog ports and other delivery mechanisms as a result, and then of course the chaos that disrupts thereafter,\" he added. The ship, one of the largest in the world, became horizontally wedged in the canal last Tuesday. Since then crews worked night and day to free the vessel, which at more than 1,300 feet is almost as long as the Empire State Building is tall. Ultimately, the ship was dislodged around 9 a.m. ET on Monday after more than 10 tugboats arrived on the scene, along with specialized dredging equipment and expert salvage teams all working together to free the 220,000-ton vessel. But while traffic has now resumed in the key waterway, the repercussions after days of halted movement will continue to be felt.\n\nImagery of the Ever Given in the Suez Canal captured by the company's WorldView-3 satellite on Saturday, March 27, 2021. Maxar Technologies\n\nAround 12% of global trade flows through the Suez Canal on massive ships like the Ever Given, which can hold 20,000 containers. Lloyd's List estimates that more than $9 billion worth of goods passes through the 120-mile waterway each day, translating to around $400 million per hour. \"The disruption of a week of this size is going to continue to have cascading effects ... it's got to be at least 60 days before things get sorted out and appear to be a bit back to normal,\" said Stephen Flynn, professor of political science at Northeastern University. \"This level of disruption cascaded after every 24 hours,\" he added. The knock-on effects include congestion at ports as well as vessels not being in the right place for their next scheduled journey. Most importantly, it further exacerbates supply chains already reeling from a container shortage amid the Covid-19 buying boom. Flynn, who is also founding director at the Global Resilience Institute, noted that this is one of the challenges of a just-in-time system. Assembly lines will be idled because parts don't show up when they're expected, for example.\n\nA satellite image shows the Suez Canal blocked by the stranded container ship Ever Given in Egypt March 25, 2021, in this image obtained from Twitter page of Director General of Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin. Picture taken March 25, 2021. Roscosmos | Reuters\n\n\"It's never been stressed this badly before, and it's going to take a really long time, and they're just beginning the process of sorting it out ... you've essentially created this traffic jam that doesn't allow you just to reset and restart — you have to restack and reset the system and that's something that's going to take a lot of choreography,\" Flynn added. In the hunt for efficiency and low-cost goods, ships have become larger and larger. Not all ports can handle ships the size of the Ever Given, creating concentrated systems. Ships of this size might sail from China to Rotterdam — the path the Ever Given was on — where its containers might then be loaded onto smaller ships that sail to the rest of Europe or other destinations including the United States. In other words, smaller ports can't just absorb the scheduling conflicts created by the traffic jam at the Suez Canal. Nearly 19,000 ships passed through the canal during 2020, for an average of 51.5 per day, according to the Suez Canal Authority. By Monday morning, more than 350 vessels total were backed up on both ends of the Suez Canal, as the Ever Given cut off access in both directions. Shipping agent GAC said that traffic was expected to be back to normal in the next three to four days.\n\nwatch now\n\nShips began heading south from the Great Bitter Lake into the Suez Gulf on Monday afternoon as the Suez Canal Authority sought to get traffic moving again. \"However long it takes, the damage has been done, with carriers warning to expect months of supply chain disruption and even tighter capacity as Asia imports surge to Europe and North America,\" said Mark Szakonyi, executive editor of The Journal of Commerce by IHS Markit. Some shipping companies, including Hapag-Lloyd, made the decision to reroute vessels around the Cape of Good Hope. This adds at least an additional week of sailing time, while also leading to higher fuel costs.\n\nStranded container ship Ever Given, one of the world's largest container ships, is seen after it ran aground, in Suez Canal, Egypt March 26, 2021.

It had lost the ability to steer amid high winds and a dust storm, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said in a statement.\n\nPeter Berdowski, CEO of Dutch company Boskalis, which is trying to free the ship, said it was too early to say how long the job might take.\n\n“We can’t exclude it might take weeks, depending on the situation,” Berdowski told the Dutch television programme “Nieuwsuur”.\n\nDiscover What is the World Economic Forum doing to help the manufacturing industry rebound from COVID-19? Show more The COVID-19 global pandemic continues to disrupt manufacturing and supply chains, with severe consequences for society, businesses, consumers and the global economy. As the effects of coronavirus unfold, companies are asking what short-term actions they need to take to ensure business continuity and protect their employees. How should they be preparing for the rebound and increasing their manufacturing and supply systems’ resilience? The World Economic Forum, in collaboration with Kearney, brought together senior-level executives from various industry sectors to identify the best response to the COVID-19 crisis. Their recommendations have been published in a new white paper: How to rebound stronger from COVID-19: Resilience in manufacturing and supply systems.

The Ever Given, a 220,000-ton mega ship nearly a quarter-mile long with a 20,000 container capacity, ran aground after being blown by strong winds while entering Egypt's Suez Canal from the Red Sea. It's completely blocked the passageway that is home to as much as 12% of the world's seaborne trade and through which 50 container ships normally transit per day. Tugboats and dredgers are currently working to dislodge the ship, which has been stuck since Tuesday evening. But the operation could take weeks, one of the executives involved has warned. \"While we believe and hope the situation will get resolved shortly, there are some risks of the ship breaking,\" JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic wrote in a note Thursday. \"In this scenario, the canal would be blocked for an extended period of time, which could result in significant disruptions to global trade, skyrocketing shipping rates, further increase of energy commodities, and an uptick in global inflation.\"\n\nStranded container ship Ever Given, one of the world's largest container ships, is seen after it ran aground, in Suez Canal, Egypt March 25, 2021. Suez Canal Authority | Reuters\n\nThe crisis is another blow to the global supply chain after a brutal year ridden with delays, shortages and price squeezes on the back of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWhat does this mean for global trade?\n\nThe shipping delays could impact everything from the clothes and shoes you ordered online to gym equipment, electronics, food, and energy supplies — meaning gas prices could get higher, too. \"Suez Canal container blockage to further rattle global supply chains, to drive pricing higher given pent-up demand,\" analysts at JPMorgan said in a research note Thursday. The man-made Suez, at 120 miles long, is a key transit point connecting East to West. And the 20,000 ships that pass through it yearly transport everything from oil and gas to machine parts and consumer goods.\n\nBIMCO\n\nWhile it's still early to say what the full impact of the tanker crisis will be, the bank expects that in the near term, \"the blockage is likely to add to industry supply strains, which are already hampered by ongoing supply chain bottlenecks'' in the form of port congestion and shortages of both vessels and containers due to Covid-19. Ships are going to have to shift to entirely different routes, \"will result in longer voyage times and causing further delays,\" JPMorgan wrote. And those delays could be more than 15 days for many ships, whose alternative is sailing around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, which analysts say would increase shipping times by up to 30%.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"The immediate impact of delays in the canal will centre on European – Asian trade, adding delays to already disrupted supply chains affecting oil and refined products' supplies,\" ING senior economist Joanna Konings wrote in a client note Wednesday.\n\nImpact on crude prices\n\nThe Ever Given's misfortune has already impacted oil prices. News of the Suez blockage drew in buyers, and along with other economic data contributed to international benchmark Brent crude's one-month futures contract gaining \"its biggest one-day gain in nearly a year to close at $64.41\" on Wednesday, according to Arctic Securities, though it lost some of those gains by Thursday. In the meantime, between 5% and 10% of all seaborne oil is transported through the Suez, meaning that for each day that the ship remains stuck, it delays the shipment of another 3 million to 5 million barrels of oil per day. Several tankers carrying jet fuel and gasoil are also held up on the Persian Gulf-Europe route, as well as empty tankers crossing to pick up North Sea oil, S&P Platts reported Thursday.\n\nA graph showing shipping traffic halted around the Suez Canal after the ship Ever Given began wedged in the canal. Source: MarineTraffic\n\nThe canal is also a transit point for around 8% of global liquefied natural gas (LNG), and a prolonged disruption could impact flows to primarily the European market. Any price effect will likely be brief, however, says Peter Sutherland, president of Houston-based energy investment firm Henrietta Resources. \"It won't have a lasting impact on prices, but it will help lend support in the run-up to the OPEC+ meeting,\" Sutherland told CNBC. \"The risk premium in oil markets will likely be short-lived, but the canal back-up still managed to shift the market narrative.\"\n\nThe winners\n\nThe canal blockage is certainly not bad news for everyone — spot freight rates are set to jump even higher on pent-up demand, making money for the operators, market watchers say. \"A more prolonged closure of the Suez Canal would see container shipping as the biggest beneficiary, while tanker, dry bulk and air cargo might also see some higher rates,\" wrote JPMorgan, describing the tightening of shipping rates \"as a upside risk.\"\n\nSatellite images of container ship Ever Given stuck in Egypt's Suez Canal. Source: European Space Agency Sentinel-2 Satellite\n\nWho is set to benefit most? JPMorgan highlights Asian liners, saying that despite higher bunker costs due to longer rerouted journeys and increased congestion, they expect higher spot freight rates. \"This instead of hurting profitability is expected to be positive for bottom-line for Asia liners, in our view,\" the bank wrote. Bank of America's analysts agree. \"A Suez closure of a few weeks would be very positive for spot freight rates — by effectively removing supply by adding 20-30% to sailing distance via Cape of Good Hope,\" it wrote in its note Thursday.\n\nRisks and vulnerabilities grow\n\nIn the meantime, the Suez Canal's blockage \"will add to an already rising Middle East risk premium for oil and refined products,\" Torbjorn Soltvedt, principal MENA analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, said, highlighting increased risk of attacks on oil facilities amid regional tensions. The uncertainty over the blockage's duration \"creates a window of opportunity for state and non-state actors seeking to maximize the impact of attacks against tankers and energy infrastructure in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea,\" he warned.\n\nCargo ship \"Ever Given\" stuck and blocking traffic in the Suez Canal Source: Reuters",

        "content": "The Ever Given, a containership the length of about two city blocks, ran aground and blocked all traffic in the Suez Canal in March 2021. (cc) Rosenfeld Media, via Flickr.\n\nEditors’ note: On March 26, 2024, the 95,000 ton containership Dali drifted into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, destroying the bridge and halting port and road traffic. Three years earlier, the containership Ever Given ran aground in the Suez Canal, blocking the busy waterway for nearly a week. For more insights into the challenges of global shipping, we’ve highlighted this analysis of maritime transportation by contributor Laleh Khalili. Her analysis originally appeared in the Washington Post on March 25, 2021.\n\nOn the morning of March 23, 2021, a gargantuan freighter laden with containers, heading north to the Mediterranean, ran aground in the Suez Canal. The weather was blustery, with sandy gusts blowing across the canal. A strong gust and the hydrodynamics of shallow waters pushed the merchant vessel Ever Given into the east bank of the canal.\n\nIt was immediately clear that the bulbous nose at the prow of the ship had lodged in the canal’s bank, and the 1,300-foot body of the ship lay diagonally across the waterway, blocking traffic. Ironically, as my new book explains, the most dramatic leaps in ship sizes were precipitated by Suez Canal politics in the 1950s and 1960s. Decades later, it’s the vast size of the ship that makes refloating it so difficult.\n\nBy Friday, more than 160 ships were anchored in the Mediterranean and the Red seas. Egyptian officials appeared confident the canal could reopen within days, while salvage engineers cautioned that freeing the stuck ship might take weeks. Oil prices jumped up by a few dollars on Wednesday; and insurance claims on freight delays have begun to trickle in.\n\nWhy ships became so large\n\nAt a quarter-mile, the ship is almost as long as the Empire State Building is tall. When fully laden, Ever Given can carry 20,000 20-foot freight containers, stacked in 10 or 11 rows, both on the deck and in the ship’s hold. Because of its size and its deep draft, only the largest ports with deep harbors and the largest gantry cranes can receive the ship.\n\nSince its inauguration in 1869, the Suez Canal has been one of the most significant arteries of global trade. Its construction by rival European powers — Britain and France — consolidated their empires in Asia and Africa. When Egypt nationalized the canal in 1956, Britain, France and Israel attacked the country through Sinai. In the war that ensued, the canal was closed, filled with war debris and sunken ships.\n\nThe eight-month closure of the canal in 1956 and the eight-year closure after the 1967 war led to significant changes in global shipping. Here’s why: If oil tankers from the Middle East now had to round the Cape of Good Hope to reach Europe, their journey would take at least three weeks longer.\n\nTo ensure profitability of this longer route, many freight carriers opted to take advantage of economies of scale by ordering massive new ships. In the space of a few years, oil tankers mushroomed in size, with the ultra large crude carriers reaching 1,300 feet, the same length as Ever Given.\n\nContainer ships account for much of global trade\n\nAbout 30 percent of the world’s seaborne trade today is in oil and petroleum products. Container ships like Ever Given primarily carry manufactured goods, and now account for one-third of the volume of global trade and an astonishing 60 percent of seaborne trade by value.\n\nNearly 12 percent of the world’s cargo travels through the Suez Canal. That this vast flow of cargo could come to a halt because a gust of wind blew a ship off course makes the simultaneous immensity and brittleness of global trade apparent.\n\nAnd the grounding of Ever Given also has exposed how the complex ownership structures in global shipping might make it difficult to hold anyone accountable. The Ever Given is operated by Taiwan-based shipping company Evergreen Maritime. Evergreen charters the ship from a Japanese firm; a Dubai-based company acts as the agent for the ship in ports; and the ship flies the flag of Panama.\n\nA ship follows the laws of the flag it flies, not that of the ship’s owners or operators. The Panamanian flag is a “flag of convenience.” Flags of convenience, or open registries, have more lax labor and environmental regulations, and lower thresholds for safety and insurance provisions.\n\nLast summer, the Wakashio, another ship owned by a Japanese firm but flagged to Panama, ran aground in Mauritius, spilling oil into the island’s sensitive marine ecosystem. The fracturing of ownership and operation across different legal jurisdictions and national boundaries also makes it much harder to assign responsibility for accidents such as the grounding of Wakashio and Ever Given.\n\nIt is as yet unclear how long it will take for the Ever Given to be towed out of the flow of the canal traffic. As the clock ticks, Egypt is not collecting tolls on ships’ passage. And ships, including those operated by Evergreen, have begun to reroute around the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nFor now, the knock-on effect of the stoppage is the accumulation of insurance claims and late fees, and delays in the delivery of cargo. But in the longer term, much as it did in the mid-20th century, the 2021 blockage of the Suez Canal, combined with the effects of the pandemic, may precipitate a reckoning in how maritime transport operates.\n\nLaleh Khalili is professor of international politics at Queen Mary University of London and the author of Sinews of War and Trade: Shipping and Capitalism in the Arabian Peninsula (Verso 2020).

        "content": "Maybe it’s a favorite sweater or the device you’re using—something you’ve recently worn, held, or eaten very likely passed through the Panama Canal. The roughly 82-kilometer-long channel connecting the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea (and, ultimately, the Atlantic Ocean) has been an important artery of global shipping since it opened in 1914. This year, the canal’s relevance has been thrust into the political spotlight as President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have expressed a desire for the United States to reclaim ownership of it.\n\nIn recent years the operation of the Panama Canal has been increasingly affected by changes in rainfall, and some data suggest that more shifts are on the way. Delays and reductions in traffic caused by these events portend a more volatile future for the shipping route should climate change alter periodic weather patterns.\n\nThe Panama Canal is built around a system of locks. Ships, ranging from privately owned yachts to gigantic Neopanamax vessels capable of transporting more than 13,000 standard cargo containers, traverse three locks to gain roughly 25 meters in elevation and three locks to drop back down on the other side. That process, which takes 8–10 hours, confers enormous savings in both time and fuel: Ships traveling from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean or vice versa would otherwise take a route around the southern tip of South America.\n\n“Five percent of shipping globally traverses the Panama Canal.”\n\n“Five percent of shipping globally traverses the Panama Canal,” said Mark Russo, the chief science officer at Everstream Analytics, a supply chain risk analytics company in Elmhurst, Ill. “It’s a critical artery for global trade.”\n\nPrecipitation is key to ensuring that Gatun Lake, the artificial lake that makes up a major part of the canal, remains full enough for Neopanamax ships to safely navigate without running aground. The lake loses water not only to evaporation and deliberate pumping—it supplies some of the region’s drinking water—but also to the very operation of the canal: Each day, about 7 billion liters of water are extracted to supply the locks.\n\nPanama fortunately tends to receive a lot of rainfall: on average, more than 2,000 millimeters each year. “Panama is an incredibly wet country,” said Steven Paton, the director of the Physical Monitoring Program at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama City. But the past 3 decades have included three relatively dry years in the canal’s watershed. In water years 1998, 2016, and 2024 rainfall dipped below 1,750 millimeters. (Water years span the 12-month period between 1 October and 30 September.)\n\nWater-scarce years tend to occur about once every 2 decades, said Patton, and the relatively tight clustering of dry years is unprecedented in the watershed’s 144-year precipitation record, he added. “We’ve never seen that before.”\n\nYears of Scarcity\n\nBecause of low water levels in Gatun Lake during those years, the Panama Canal Authority significantly reduced the number of ships passing through the canal. A total of 11,240 vessels traversed the canal in 2024, compared with 14,080 in 2023. The Panama Canal Authority also limited ships’ maximum draft. Reducing a vessel’s draft—that is, the depth at which it sits in the water—means removing cargo, Russo said. Such rearranging takes time and results in longer queues at the locks. “That ultimately slows down the vessels moving through,” he said.\n\nResearchers have been keen to understand whether such collisions between supply chain logistics and the weather at the Panama Canal will become more commonplace in the future. Shipping companies reserve a spot in line at the canal more than a year in advance, so such a forward-looking perspective is important, Russo said. “If you’re planning on your shipments through the Panama Canal, you can get out of in front of those risks a year in advance.”\n\nNot surprisingly, all three of the recent water-scarce years in the Panama Canal watershed corresponded to El Niño years, during which warmer-than-average ocean water in the equatorial Pacific unleashes a slew of atmospheric trickle-down effects that culminate in less rain falling in Central America. Such teleconnections between oceanic and atmospheric processes are nothing new, said Michael McPhaden, a physical oceanographer at NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle. “This has been going on for millions of years.”\n\nAs of now, there’s not convincing evidence that climate change is altering the frequency of the cycle between El Niño years and their converse, known as La Niña years. That cycle, lasting anywhere from 2 to 7 years, is known as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Recent research showed that the 2024 precipitation observed in Panama was consistent with the ENSO cycle and could not be conclusively attributed to the effects of climate change.\n\nThe Big Get Bigger\n\nWhat is changing as the planet warms is the intensity of big storms. “The strong events are getting stronger,” said McPhaden. Over the recent instrumental record, there’s been about a 10% increase in storm intensity, and modeling suggests another 10% increase may occur over the next century, he said. “We’ll see more frequent strong events in the future potentially.”\n\n“We know that forest cover is critical.”\n\nThough having more rain in the Panama Canal watershed might seem like a boon to ship traffic, there is such a thing as too much precipitation. In 2010, record-setting rainfall temporarily caused a complete shutdown of the Panama Canal. The problem was the rapidly rising water level in Gatun Lake, which threatened to overtop an earthen dam between the lake and the Chagres River. “You never ever want to overtop an earthen dam because it begins to erode exponentially fast,” said Patton. Crews worked around the clock to siphon water, but the lake still crept to within 1 meter of the top of the dam.\n\nEfforts are underway to better understand the hydrology of the Panama Canal watershed. Such work could help canal managers steel the shipping route against future weather-driven events like those of 1998, 2010, 2016, and 2024. An example is the Agua Salud Project, run by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, which studies forest cover in the region. Forests act like sponges, absorbing rainfall and releasing it in a controlled manner. That’s key to ensuring reasonably constant water levels in Gatun Lake, said Patton. “We know that forest cover is critical.”\n\nThough the trials of the dry past year are still fresh in many people’s minds, there’s also a sense of optimism right now that 2025 will be a good year for ship traffic through the Panama Canal—current water levels in Gatun Lake are the highest they’ve been in the past 5 years.\n\n—Katherine Kornei (@KatherineKornei), Science Writer\n\n13 February 2025: This article has been updated to correct a source’s name.\n\nCitation: Kornei, K.

        "content": "The Wall Street Journal’s Costas Paris and Jack Pitcher reported that “China’s government is threatening to block a deal that would transfer ownership of dozens of seaports to Western investors if Cosco, China’s largest shipping company, doesn’t get a stake. The proposed sale includes two ports at the Panama Canal and more than 40 others around the world, all owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison.”\n\n“China is pushing for state-owned Cosco to be an equal partner and shareholder of the ports with BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Co., a containership operator, according to people familiar with the deal talks,” Paris and Pitcher reported. “BlackRock and MSC in March reached a preliminary agreement to buy the ports in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion.”\n\n“Now, BlackRock, MSC and Hutchison all are open to Cosco’s taking a stake, the people familiar with the talks said,” Paris and Pitcher reported. “Any deal giving a stake in the Panama ports to a Chinese-owned company would likely upset President Trump, who has threatened to take control of the canal and has objected to Hutchison’s ownership of two ports there. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment Thursday.”\n\nReuters reported that “China has always been firmly opposed to the ‘use of economic coercion, hegemony, bullying, and infringement of the legitimate rights and interests of other countries,’ its foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press briefing on Friday, when asked about the report.”\n\nDetails of the Proposed Ports Deal\n\n“Tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison in March announced it would sell its 80% holding in the ports business, which encompasses 43 ports in 23 countries,” Reuters reported. “The business has an enterprise value of $22.8 billion, including debt.”\n\n“After much scrutiny and criticism in China, CK Hutchison confirmed in May that Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run MSC, one of the world’s top container shipping groups, was the main investor in a group seeking to buy the ports,” Reuters reported. “…The proposed sale has also drawn the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly expressed his desire to reduce Chinese influence around the Panama Canal and termed the deal a ‘reclaiming’ of the waterway after it was first announced.”\n\nWhile it has been a while since President Trump addressed issues around the canal, The Hill’s Alex Gangitano reported in January that “President-elect Trump on Tuesday refused to commit to not using the U.S. military to gain control of the Panama Canal, after vowing last month to take over operation of the key passageway.”\n\n“Trump was questioned during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago about his recently targeting the canal as well as Greenland for possible American expansion and if he would say he would not use the military to gain control of it,” Gangitano reported. “‘I’m not going to commit to that. It might be that you have to do something,’ Trump said. ‘Look, the Panama Canal is vital to our country, it’s being operated by China, China. And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama, we didn’t give it to China.’”\n\nCanal of Extreme Importance to U.S. Ag Shipping\n\nFarm News Media’s Dennis Rudat reported in January 2024 that “representing 14% of all U.S. maritime trade, 72% of all the cargo transiting the Panama Canal is either coming from or going to the U.S., including a substantial portion of U.S. agricultural exports, according to (to American Farm Bureau Federation Economist Betty) Resnick.”\n\n“‘So, the Panama Canal is really a critical choke point for U.S. agriculture and U.S. economy in general,’ Resnick said, with 18% of corn exports, 32% of soybean exports and over 90% of sorghum exports moving through the shipping canal,” Rudat reported.\n\nAxios’ Ben Berkowitz reported that globally, “about 2.5% of all global maritime trade passes through the canal. … About 10,000 ships a year transit the canal, though in recent times severe drought has limited capacity and helped push transit rates higher.”",

        "content": "How A Long Shutdown Of The Suez Canal Might Have Roiled The Global Economy\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption ScapeWare3d/DigitalGlobe/Getty Images ScapeWare3d/DigitalGlobe/Getty Images\n\nBefore the grounding of the massive Ever Given container ship in the Suez Canal, some 50 vessels a day, or about 10% of global trade, sailed through the waterway each day — everything from consumer electronics to food, chemicals, ore and petroleum.\n\nWhen the ship was lodged sideways in the canal, closing off the main oceangoing highway between Europe and Asia, much of that cargo sat idle, either waiting to transit or stuck in port while owners and shippers tried to decide what to do. It was a waiting game that Lloyd's List estimated cost $9.6 billion per day.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat traffic will begin flowing again, now that the vessel has finally been freed.\n\nNPR took a look at the implications for the shipping industry and for global trade.\n\nWhat were the alternatives to ships while the Suez Canal was closed?\n\nShip owners and operators had a few options, but none were particularly good ones.\n\nThe adage that time is money couldn't be more true in the shipping business. For vessels already backed up in the canal, if the waterway had remained blocked, a decision would have been needed to be made about whether to continue waiting or go to Plan B.\n\n\"For vessels already up the Suez, it will take several days just to sail south on the Red Sea and get on a shipping lane around Africa,\" Basil Karatzas, CEO of Karatzas Marine Advisors & Co., a New York-based shipping finance advisory and ship brokerage, said Friday. From there, \"round Africa\" — the only practical seagoing route between Europe and Asia for centuries before the Suez was opened in 1869 — would take weeks more.\n\n\"If they start sailing (prematurely) around Africa, they are guaranteed a two- to four-week delay and several million [dollars] extra costs in fuel,\" Karatzas said. Instead, owners and operators of many vessels stuck at the canal were simply waiting and hoping \"for a quick resolution.\"\n\nTo get an idea just what a shortcut the canal represents, commodity analysts Kpler said that for a vessel averaging 12 knots (14 mph), Suez to Amsterdam, takes 13 days via the canal. Around the Cape of Good Hope, it takes 41 days.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe reopening of the canal spares shippers some tough and potentially costly decisions. The same goes for vessels that haven't yet left port, although the cost in time and money for them wouldn't have been as great.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Edwin Remsberg/VWPics/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Edwin Remsberg/VWPics/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nAnother possible option would have been to go through the Panama Canal by way of the Pacific. But many of the largest commercial vessels today, such as the 1,300-foot Ever Given herself, are too big to fit through the Panama Canal.\n\nJonathan Roach, a container market analyst for Braemar ACM Shipbroking, said in a recent letter to clients that if the situation at the canal was not resolved soon, the route via the Cape of Good Hope was the most likely detour, even for vessels that can fit through the Panama Canal.\n\nLast year, due to a combination of excess capacity and falling fuel prices, some shippers did just that — opting to go the Africa route to avoid Suez Canal transit fees.\n\nTheoretically, there was one more possibility, but it too has severe limitations. A shorter route through the Arctic known alternately as the Northeast Passage, or the Northern Sea Route, or NSR, has been touted by Russia.\n\nThe number of vessels using the NSR has increased to several hundred each year, thanks in part to global warming that has reduced polar ice. However, traffic there still amounts to a mere fraction of what passes through the Suez.\n\nThe Northern Sea Route is still not considered practical by most shipping companies. For example, in 2018, Maersk, the world's largest container line, sent one of its ships via the NSR, but the company emphasized it doesn't see the route \"as an alternative to our usual routes\" and that the voyage was merely \"a trial to explore an unknown route for container shipping and to collect scientific data.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLastly, it's worth noting that a prolonged shutdown of the Suez Canal is not unprecedented. The waterway was closed for eight years, beginning in 1967, after war broke out between Egypt and Israel. As a result, ships were forced to divert around the tip of Africa.\n\nAs of Friday, Kpler told NPR that two Europe-bound liquefied natural gas carriers had diverted and that several more ships carrying gasoline and diesel appeared to have also done so.\n\nHow would a prolonged shutdown of the Suez have affected the supply chain?\n\nGlobal supply chains, already significantly disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, could have been further stressed by a prolonged shutdown of the Suez Canal, said Jonathan Gold, vice president for supply chain and customs policy with the National Retail Federation.\n\n\"This is just one more challenge to the supply chain operations that we're seeing across the board,\" Gold said Friday. \"[We are] already seeing congestion and other things impacting the supply chain. This is one more thing that adds to that.\"\n\nThe greatest impact would have been felt in the European market, which relies most on transfers through the canal. But given the interconnected nature of global manufacturing and commerce, there was likely to have been a knock-on effect for the United States.\n\n\"These things can't be looked at discretely,\" said Jennifer Bisceglie, an expert in global supply chain resilience and founder and CEO of Interos Inc. \"Last year, you had this big wake-up call of the concentration risks of the physical supply chain from COVID, and then you had this on top of it.\"\n\nBisceglie said it's time for companies to consider \"having more disparate [supply hubs] instead of having all our eggs on one cargo ship.\"\n\nMaersk told NPR on Friday that it was too early to commit to rerouting any of its massive global container fleet. The Copenhagen, Denmark-based company said in a statement, that while \"out of our control, we apologize for the inconvenience this incident may cause to your business and for critical shipments.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"[We] recommend that you reach out to your local sales representative for dialogues and quotations on alternative solutions, such as air and rail for urgent cargo that is still at origin or elsewhere,\" Maersk had said.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Shen Chunchen/VCG via Getty Images Shen Chunchen/VCG via Getty Images\n\nWould a long shutdown have meant a rise in prices?\n\nAs it turns out, a weeklong delay for a few hundred ships at the Suez will only have a negligible impact for consumers, but a prolonged delay could have increased the cost of shipping, complicated manufacturing and ultimately driven up prices.\n\n\"[A] few days might not have a meaningful impact,\" said John Kartsonas of Breakwave Advisors, which specializes in asset management and advisory services for the shipping and commodities industries. But if the situation had taken weeks to resolve, as had been feared earlier, the disruptions would likely have sent shipping rates higher.\n\nOperating costs would have climbed significantly, too. More days at sea means burning more fuel.\n\n\"The large container ships, the super, mega-max container ships, can burn 100 [to] 150 tons of fuel a day,\" Braemar ACM Shipbroking's Roach told NPR.\n\nThat's $80,000 a day in fuel and an extra 10 days travel time — both to and from Asia. \"So, you're looking at the best part of a million dollars with your operating costs. So it's a million dollars out and a million dollars back,\" he said.\n\nIn his letter to clients, Roach also noted problems at the Suez Canal could disrupt the flow of containers. A trade imbalance between Europe and Asia means that filled containers going west return mostly empty to ports in the east to be refilled. \"If empty stocks dwindle in Asia, there is the short-term possibility of an increase\" in prices, Roach wrote.\n\nInsurance was another consideration.\n\nRichard Meade, editor at Lloyd's List, said a prolonged blockage at the Suez would have had financial implications \"borne by the owners, but then passed onto the insurers.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"And then that will obviously result in a spike in insurance premiums,\" he said on Friday.\n\nOverall, though, Joanna Konings, a senior economist at ING, told Bloomberg that she was \"relatively sanguine\" about the impact on trade. But she wouldn't rule out \"an inflationary shock that could come right to the consumer.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mohamed Elshahed/AP Mohamed Elshahed/AP\n\nWould gas prices have gone up?\n\nShipping rates for petroleum products nearly doubled in the aftermath of the Ever Given's grounding, according to Reuters. But now that the situation is resolved, they are likely to stabilize.\n\nAlthough oil prices may also have felt some upward pressure in the wake of the Ever Given incident, their increase was blunted by news of further COVID-19 lockdowns in Europe that are likely to continue to depress demand.\n\nWhat would it have meant at the pump?\n\n\"If the Suez Canal remains blocked for more than a few more days or over a week, we could likely see some disruptions in oil flows between the Middle East and Europe that could impact price globally,\" Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said Friday, days before the ship was freed.\n\n\"But it should not hamper flows of oil to North America,\" De Haan said. \"At worst, if the issue continues, if oil prices do see a sustained rally, the blockage could have a small and limited impact on gas prices, likely no more than a few cents per gallon on average.\"",

        "content": "Current global economic and geopolitical landscapes are shaped by several key uncertainties. Tensions between Israel and Iran, particularly regarding the Strait of Hormuz, pose risks to regional stability and energy supply routes. Similarly, Houthi activity in the Red Sea threatens shipping through the Suez Canal. Oil sanctions continue to disrupt global energy markets, while evolving U.S. import tariffs add further complexity to international trade dynamics. Additionally, uncertainties around Chinese GDP growth cast doubt on the strength of global economic recovery.\n\nBased on our forecasting data, our Shipping Market Outlook for Q3 2025 offers a quarterly summary of how this uncertainty could play out across the Tankers, Bulkers, Containers, and Gas industries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTankers\n\nGeopolitical risks, sanctions, and shifts in trade flows, particularly due to Red Sea tensions and EU bans on Russian oil, are driving continued volatility in Tanker rates and elevated ton-mile demand.\n\nTanker utilisation is supported by rerouted long-haul crude trades from the Atlantic to Asia, but faces headwinds from new vessel deliveries, improving fuel efficiency, and a global transition to lower oil demand.\n\nFleet growth is expected to outpace demand after 2025 due to low scrapping levels, a rising orderbook, and increased deliveries, although regulatory pressures like the EU ETS and IMO decarbonisation targets may offset this trend.\n\nOil demand growth faces structural headwinds from electrification, engine efficiency, and behavioural shifts, indicating a longer-term challenge for Tanker trade volumes.\n\nChina remains a key swing factor for oil demand and trade volumes, but broader Asian demand, macroeconomic fragility, and inflationary pressures are reshaping global consumption patterns.\n\nWhile 2024 saw a surge in Container and Tanker orders amid Red Sea disruptions, overall ordering activity has declined sharply in 2025, and newbuilding prices remain high, though likely to ease as shipyard pressure reduces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBulkers\n\nLow ordering activity in recent years has reduced the Bulker sector’s orderbook, supporting relatively low supply growth and a healthier market balance, though demand remains uncertain due to tariffs and trade disruptions.\n\nChina’s economic challenges, especially a struggling real estate sector and heavy reliance on exports, are expected to soften dry bulk import demand in 2025, negatively impacting the market balance.\n\nGrowth in ton-mile demand is anticipated over the longer term, driven by new trade routes like increased iron ore shipments from Guinea to China following the opening of the Simandou mine in 2026.\n\nOngoing geopolitical tensions, notably in the Red Sea with potential renewed Houthi attacks, are likely to keep vessel rerouting in place, adding approximately 1% more ton-miles and supporting freight rates.\n\nContainer vessel ordering surged dramatically in 2024 due to Red Sea rerouting and a rebound in earnings, setting records and increasing shipyard utilization, though activity slowed sharply in the first half of 2025.\n\nHigh orderbook-to-fleet ratios in Containers and LNG, along with elevated newbuilding prices, are expected to slow future ordering volumes, easing shipyard capacity pressures and likely leading to a gradual decline in newbuilding prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainers\n\nDespite firm freight rates in 2024 and early 2025, rates are forecast to decline steadily from mid-2025 onward as vessel supply growth outpaces demand, and idle capacity is expected to rise.\n\nNet fleet growth was robust at 5.5% in 2023 and 9.7% in 2024, with an expected average of 8.2% annual growth from 2025 to 2028, driven by high ordering activity in recent years.\n\nRecord ordering activity in 2024 saw around 4.3 million TEUs ordered, pushing the orderbook-to-fleet ratio to 31.1%, with a recent shift in preference from New-Panamax to ULCVs due to route changes.\n\nScrapping activity has remained low but is expected to increase moderately, particularly in smaller vessels under 3,000 TEUs, as older ships become less economical to operate amid forecasted freight rate declines.\n\nAfter surging during the pandemic and again in 2024 due to Red Sea disruptions, Container ordering activity has slowed sharply in 2025, and high orderbook levels combined with elevated newbuilding prices are expected to constrain future ordering and ease shipyard capacity pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGas\n\nUS LPG production grew 5.9% in 2024 and is forecast to grow 4.2% in 2025, with export growth slowing in 2025 due to terminal capacity limits but expected to accelerate from 2026 onward.\n\nVLGC/VLAC fleet growth was 10.9% in 2024, with average annual growth of 7.3% expected through 2028. Strong recent ordering is expected to put pressure on earnings despite healthy demand, while scrapping remains low due to a young fleet.\n\nMedium-sized LPG vessels show robust fleet growth (c.10.8% annually), while smaller vessels face limited ordering and aging fleets, leading to higher scrapping rates in that segment.\n\nVLGC earnings averaged around 43,300 USD/Day in 2024, expected to decline in 2025 due to slower export growth, briefly rebound in 2026 with terminal expansions, then decline again through 2027-28 due to fleet growth; Panama Canal transit conditions remain stable but sensitive to seasonal water levels.\n\nPetrochemical gas trades face overcapacity and weak demand amid trade uncertainties (notably US-China), though regional intra-Asia trade and macroeconomic improvements may support volume rebounds in the medium.\n\nSource: Veson",

        "content": "PANAMA CITY, Panama – The Panama Canal is owned by the Panamanian government, but operates like a business.\n\nIts number one customer, the United States, is unhappy.\n\nAlmost 75% of the cargo passing through the canal is either destined for or originates in the U.S., and President Donald Trump continues to vociferously complain about the canal’s operation.\n\n“American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape, or form. And that includes the United States Navy,” Trump said in his inaugural address on Jan. 20. “And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.”\n\nDespite multiple meetings between diplomats from both countries, Trump hasn’t backed down.\n\nAdministration officials point to The Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, the first of two Torrijos–Carter treaties ratified by the U.S. Senate and signed into law by President Jimmy Carter in 1979.\n\nAs part of the treaty, Panama promised to keep the canal open and secure during peace and war for vessels from all nations. The treaty ensured that all transit tolls and charges would be “just, equitable and reasonable” for all ships seeking passage.\n\nRicaurte Vásquez Morales, the Canal Authority administrator, said Panama has kept its word and that any increase in charges are due to market forces.\n\n“We must have a general application of our tolls and prices,” Vásquez Morales said. “We cannot discriminate, but that does not mean that the market cannot make a decision.”\n\nAccording to Vásquez Morales, the Canal Authority has three elements to its pricing structure – vessel capacity, fresh water surcharge and supply and demand. And they are applied to every customer transiting the canal.\n\nThere is also a formula that ranks ships according to the number of transits they have made and the tolls they have paid, said Jorge Luis Quijano, who was Canal Authority administrator from 2012 to 2019. If more than one ship wants the same transit slot, the vessel with the higher rank wins.",

The vessel possesses dual-fuel capabilities and can run on both liquefied natural gas (LNG) and conventional fuel.\n\nAccording to the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), another unit owned by China’s biggest electric vehicle maker, christened as BYD Hefei, also passed through the Suez Canal on June 27, marking a significant milestone for the SCA and the canal.\n\nThe canal, long a bedrock of global trade, has weathered almost two years of on-and-off disruptions caused by Houthi attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea, prompting rerouted traffic and fears of long-term instability.\n\nOssama Rabiee, Chairman and Managing Director of the Suez Canal Authority, has highlighted that the canal has seen positive indicators concerning the regularity of vehicle carriers’ transit and the increase in transit rates, no matter the present challenges.\n\nAdditionally, he underscored that the recent passages send “a message of confidence” that the return of major shipping lines to the canal was inevitable, but that the pace would always depend on the geopolitical landscape in the region.\n\n​”We expect the tonnage of vehicle carriers transiting through the Canal to increase by at least 20% in the second half of 2025 compared to the first half of the same year,” he shared.\n\nIn line with this, Rabiee shared expectations that the number of journeys linked to BYD’s shipping line should increase, alongside the regular transit of certain voyages by COSCO Shipping (as part of its services together with Neptune Lines).\n\nWhat is more, in February this year, two journeys have reportedly passed through the Suez Canal under the new maritime service launched by United Global Ro-Ro, a recently formed joint venture (JV) between Noatum Maritime – part of AD Ports Group – and Turkiye’s logistics and port services provider Erkport.\n\nAs informed, the service links ports in the Far East with ports in the Mediterranean and northwest Europe.\n\nThe Red Sea crisis, which has been ongoing since October 2023, with attacks recently once again resumed, has brought on numerous hardships for the shipping industry. The Suez Canal’s position as a strategic checkpoint thusly came under repeated pressure, testing its resilience amid widespread rerouting around the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n  • NYK-chartered car carrier seized in Yemen as shipping gets in crosshairs of Israel-Hamas war\n  • Suez Canal blockage caused Maersk to face $89M loss, increased CO2 emissions\n\nIn February 2025, however, the Suez Canal Authority expressed anticipation for the improvement of trade flow through the canal. At the time, the SCA shared that efforts were being actively made to restore services, including for some of the world’s most prominent shipping players, such as France’s CMA CGM.\n\nBeyond infrastructural developments and safety matters, Rabiee explained at the time that the Suez Canal was making progress in implementing the Green Canal strategy. The strategy focused on building eco-friendly ships, converting certain marine units to operate on biofuel, powering pilotage stations with clean energy and unpacking new services for the ‘safe and sustainable’ disposal of marine waste.\n\nThis content is available after accepting the cookies.\n\nView on Offshore-energy.\n\n𝐃𝐨 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐰𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐛 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐚𝐮𝐝𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐞?\n\n𝐇𝐮𝐫𝐫𝐲 𝐮𝐩 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐚𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐬𝐮𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐮𝐩 𝐭𝐨 𝟓𝟎% 𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐝𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬!\n\nADVERTISING OPTIONS\n\n  • View post tag: BYD\n  • View post tag: Car Carrier\n  • View post tag: Red Sea\n  • View post tag: roro\n  • View post tag: Suez Canal\n  • View post tag: Suez Canal Authority\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated news\nTmaz: LNG-fueled BYD Changzhou docks in Mexico for first time\nPosted: about 1 month ago\nBYD: One LNG-powered RoRo newbuild launches, another sets on maiden voyage\nPosted: 3 months ago\nJinling Shipyard hands over ‘world’s largest’ dual-fuel car carrier to BYD\nPosted: 2 months ago\n\nSubscribe to the newsletter\n\nDaily news and in-depth stories in your inbox\n\nSubscribe\n\nFollow us\n\nPartner\nPartner\nGustoMSC\n\nThe Pioneers of Offshore Engineering GustoMSC, part of NOV’s Marine and Construction business, is recognized for providing advanced design & engineering consultancy for mobile offshore units and reliable equipment.

        "content": "One of the world’s most vital trade arteries was blocked by a quarter-mile-long container ship for nearly a week, creating a traffic jam that ensnared over 350 vessels and could take days to clear.\n\nBut even before the Ever Given ran aground in the Suez Canal last week, global supply chains were being stretched to the limits, making it much more expensive to move goods around the world and causing shortages of everything from exercise bikes to cheese at a time of unprecedented demand.\n\nA prolonged closure of the key route between West and East would have made matters much worse. But the knock-on effects could still last months and the costly delays or diversions to longer routes will heap pressure on businesses that were already facing container shortages, port congestion and capacity constraints.\n\nThe grounding of the Ever Given has delayed shipments of consumer goods from Asia to Europe and North America, and agricultural products moving in the opposite direction. As of Monday, some 367 vessels, including oil tankers and dozens of container ships, were waiting to transit the canal, which handles about 12% of global trade.\n\n“There’s been a great convergence of constraints in supply chains like I’ve never seen before,” said Bob Biesterfeld, the CEO of C.H. Robinson, one of the world’s largest logistics firms. The bottlenecks are widespread, affecting transport by air, ocean and road, Biesterfeld told CNN Business in an interview. “It really has been unprecedented.”\n\nThe Ever Given turned sideaways in Egypt's Suez Canal on Tuesday, blocking traffic in a crucial East-West waterway for global shipping. Suez Canal Authority/AP\n\nFreight costs soaring\n\nMore than 80% of global trade by volume is moved by sea, and the disruptions are adding billions of dollars to supply chain costs. Globally, the average cost to ship a 40-foot container shot up from $1,040 last June to $4,570 on March 1, according to S&P Global Platts.\n\nThose costs add up. In February, container shipping costs for seaborne US goods imports totaled $5.2 billion, compared to $2 billion during the same month in 2020, according to S&P Global Panjiva.\n\nThese expenses could soon mean higher prices for consumers, adding upward pressure to rising inflation — a nightmare scenario for Wall Street, which is already fearful that a spike in prices could force the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates sooner than expected.\n\n“At the moment a lot of these costs are within the supply chains,” said Chris Rogers, a research analyst at S&P Global Panjiva. “I think it’s inevitable that it will be passed on to consumers — it’s just going to take time,” he added.\n\nAn aerial view on February 22 of Yangshan Port south of Shanghai, one of the world's busiest container shipping ports. Shen Chunchen/VCG/Getty Images\n\nThe coronavirus wreaked havoc on global supply chains last year, as lockdowns temporarily closed factories and disrupted the normal flow of trade. Economic activity slowed dramatically at the start of the pandemic, and the rapid rebound in trade volumes that followed caught companies off guard.\n\nA pickup in manufacturing and seemingly insatiable demand from housebound consumers for goods such as televisions, furniture and exercise bikes has stretched suppliers and made it difficult for consumers to find the products they’d like to buy.\n\nManufacturers have also struggled to secure crucial components. Major carmakers, including Ford (F) and Volkswagen (VLKAF), have been forced to idle factories because of a shortage of computer chips caused by high demand for smartphones, gaming systems and other tech gadgets.\n\n“One year ago, global trade slowed to a crawl as the Covid-19 pandemic first hit China and then spread worldwide,” Gene Seroka, executive director at the Port of Los Angeles, said in a presentation this month. “Today, we are in the seventh month of a historic import surge, driven by unprecedented demand by American consumers,” he added.\n\nUS seaborne imports were nearly 30% higher in February than the same month last year and 20% up on February 2019, according to S&P Global Panjiva.\n\nThe import surge in the United States and elsewhere has led to a worldwide container shortage. Everything from cars and machinery to apparel and other consumer staples are shipped in these metal boxes. The factories that make them are mostly in China and many of them closed early in the pandemic, slowing down the rate at which new capacity was coming on stream, according to Rogers.\n\nContainers are in all the wrong places\n\nChina’s exports recovered fairly quickly compared to the rest of the world. At the same time, major shipping lines had canceled dozens of sailings to respond to the earlier lull in trade. The result was that empty containers piled up in all the wrong places and couldn’t meet the sudden demand in Europe and North America for Asia-made goods.\n\nHapag-Lloyd, one of the world’s largest container shipping lines, has deployed about 52 additional vessels just to move hundreds of thousands of empty containers to where they’re needed most. In more normal times, there would be fewer than 10.\n\n“That’s in reality about a ship a week that’s doing nothing more than moving empty containers,” CEO Rolf Habben Jansen told investors on a call last week.\n\nShips sit off the coast of Seal Beach, California on January 26, 2021. Jeff Gritchen/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register/Getty Images\n\nThe influx of imports has compounded problems at choked up ports, which are contending with labor shortages due to Covid-19 and a slowdown in operations caused by social distancing measures and quarantines.\n\nOn Wednesday, there were two dozen vessels at anchor awaiting entry into either the Port of Los Angeles or the neighboring Port of Long Beach, according to Port of Los Angeles spokesperson, Phillip Sanfield.\n\n“At the Port of Los Angeles, we are actively working on an additional 17 container ships,” Sanfield told CNN Business. “Pre-pandemic, we would be working about 10 container ships with no container ships waiting to enter.”\n\nThe port processed the equivalent of nearly 800,000 20-foot containers last month — the busiest February in its 114-year history.\n\nCompanies feel the strain\n\nCompanies from Under Armour (UA) and Hasbro (HAS) to Dollar Tree (DLTR), Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Crocs (CROX) have all warned about the supply chain crunch recently, pointing to container shortages, port congestion, rising shipping costs and logistics challenges.\n\nCostco (COST) said earlier this month that it was having trouble stocking imported cheeses because of a shortage of shipping containers and bottlenecks.\n\nAn analysis of 7,000 company earnings calls globally in January and February by S&P Global Panjiva found that more than a quarter mentioned “freight,” 37% mentioned “logistics” and half discussed supply chains.\n\n“We know that the freight pressure across retail is here to stay and we’ve built that into our future plans,” Mark Tritton, the CEO of Bed Bath & Beyond, told investors in January.\n\nAston Chemicals, a UK company that supplies European manufacturers of personal care products, said its shipping costs were 6.5 times more expensive in January compared to November.\n\n“We paid almost $14,000 for a container in January,” said managing director Dani Loughran. That was for a shipment from Malaysia to the port of Felixstowe in England, which just two months earlier had cost $2,100.\n\nPeloton blamed US West Coast port delays for causing “longer than acceptable wait times” for the delivery of its high-end exercise bikes. The company told shareholders in February that it’s investing over $100 million to expedite deliveries by air and sea over the next six months to improve delivery times.\n\nIt’s not the only firm resorting to airplanes to move goods that would ordinarily come by boat, as companies scramble to keep up with customer demand.\n\nAccording to Biesterfeld of C.H. Robinson, a number of durable goods typically transported in shipping containers are being carried in planes, such as toys and games. Companies are “choosing air freight because inventories are so low,” he said.\n\nAir freight is more expensive than ocean freight even under normal circumstances and therefore reserved for high-value goods. These costs are even higher at the moment because fewer flights carrying travelers means less available capacity to transport goods, a chunk of which are typically carried in the bellies of passenger planes.\n\nThat will only add to the costs facing businesses and could trickle down to consumers before long.\n\nHigher prices on the way\n\nCompanies have so far said very little about how they plan to respond to soaring freight rates but there are early signs that import prices are rising. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, US import prices experienced their largest monthly increase in January since March 2012.\n\n“We anticipate strong demand from consumers to continue over the next couple of months and don’t see meaningful change in capacity over that short time period,” said Biesterfeld.\n\nThe cost to move goods by air, ocean, truck and train is now “structurally up” on 2019 and contracts reflect that, he added. “I do think the costs are real and eventually will manifest themselves for consumers,” he said.\n\nThe extent to which this feeds through to consumer prices will vary from one product to the next. Goods that rely more heavily on imported components will likely cost more. At the same time, if the cost of imported goods rises significantly or these products become less readily available, that could give domestic producers more leeway to increase prices, said Joanna Konings, a senior economist at ING.\n\nA satellite image shows the Ever Given and idling ships at the entrance of the Suez Canal. Planet Labs Inc/Reuters\n\nFor Aston Chemicals, the cost increases were so severe that the only option was to pass them on to their customers: businesses that make everyday products such as shampoos, moisturizers and cosmetics.\n\nIf those companies in turn decide to hike prices for their customers, in this case retailers, consumers could start to feel the pinch soon, said Konings.\n\n“Most prices along the supply chain have gone in one direction, and that’s up, so it has to appear somewhere.”",

        "content": "A critical global shipping node – Egypt’s Suez Canal – was reopened on Monday, March 29, six days after being shut down when the 400-meter-long container ship Ever Given became lodged in the canal. A statement by the Suez Canal Authority initially blamed the incident on high winds and a sand storm that reduced visibility, but later said that strong winds were “not the only cause,” and that an investigation was ongoing.\n\nThere is no clear indication at this point that climate change played a role in the sandstorm that led to the ship’s blocking the canal, but the incident raises intriguing questions that likely will prompt research into any correlation.\n\nThe multi-day shutdown of one of the world’s busiest shipping chokepoints underscores the vulnerability of the global food system and economy to disruptions. That vulnerability is playing on the stage of increasingly extreme weather, rising seas, and an increasingly just-in-time world of shipping.\n\nFigure 1. MODIS satellite image from March 23, 2021, the day of the grounding of the container ship Ever Given in the Suez Canal. A cold front over Egypt was causing a widespread dust storm that affected the Red Sea, Suez Canal, and waters of the Mediterranean Sea. (Image credit: NASA Worldview)\n\nMeteorology of the event\n\nThe high winds and sand storm that contributed to the grounding incident were caused by a cold front trailing to the south of a low-pressure system centered near southern Turkey.\n\nAs the cold front swept eastwards across Egypt on March 23, powerful winds of 25-30 knots (29-35 mph) blew along the axis of the Red Sea from the south-southeast, into the southern end of the Suez Canal, as seen in the 6 UTC analysis from the GFS model (Figure 2). The Ever Given became stuck at 05:40 UTC that day. According to the GFS analysis, a sharp wind shift, with winds blowing out of the southwest to west, was present near the spot where the Ever Given blocked the canal, about five miles north of its connection with the Red Sea.\n\nThe New York Times reported that winds in excess of 70 mph blew in the region where the Ever Given became stuck; the owner of the ship, BSM, said that “initial investigations suggest the vessel grounded due to strong wind.” The strong winds were accompanied by large amounts of sand and dust, reducing visibility and making navigation more challenging.\n\nWinds this strong are uncommon in the region, but strong winds have delayed shipping traffic or closed the Suez Canal on at least two occasions – December 11, 2010, and February 11, 2015.\n\nFigure 2. The GFS model analysis from 6 UTC March 23, 2021, at the time of the grounding of the Ever Given. Sustained south-southeasterly winds of 25-30 knots (29-35 mph, yellow-green and yellow colors) were blowing across the Red Sea into the entrance of the Suez Canal. The black wind barbs show a sharp wind shift was present near the southern portion of the canal, where the Ever Given became stranded. (Image credit: Tropical Tidbits)\n\nA video Tweeted by Vakrio Technologies showed the course and heading of the Ever Given as it entered the canal, demonstrating that the canal is initially angled from southwest to northeast. Ever Given passed very close to the northwest bank of the canal at the start of its traverse, presumably pushed by the strong south-southeasterly winds blowing into the canal entrance from the Red Sea. For unknown reasons, the vessel was moving at 15 mph, well in excess of the 10 mph speed limit in the canal. As explained in an excellent analysis in the Financial Times (free registration required) by Brendan Greely, when a ship gets too close to a bank, shallow-water hydrodynamic forces can act to spin the boat – a well-known phenomenon known as the bank effect, where the water speeds up between the boat and the bank, the pressure drops, and the stern is pulled into the bank while the bow is pushed away from shore. Possibly because of the bank effect, the Ever Given then slewed close to the opposite (east) bank of the canal. At that point, the canal is oriented north-south, and the vessel angled its heading to the left, perhaps again due to the bank effect, or possibly in response to a crosswind that had developed due to a wind shift to a more westerly direction. The ship again came close to the west (left) bank, potentially because of a swirling wind that briefly blew from the south, reducing the cross-wind component that was pushing the boat to the right. The Ever Given finally ran aground with its stern on the west bank of the canal and its bow on the east bank (Figure 3), suggesting that the bank effect may have acted to spin the ship and lodge it in the canal when it came too close to the west bank.\n\nFigure 3. Sentinel-2 satellite image of the Ever Given stuck in the Suez Canal on March 24, 2021. The stern of the ship was lodged against the west bank of the canal. (Photo credit: Pierre Markuse)\n\nNear-record March heat preceded the March 23 sandstorm\n\nAn extraordinary March heat wave preceded the cold front and sandstorm that contributed to the canal-blocking incident; the day previously, Kharga, Egypt, recorded a scorching temperature of 44 degrees Celsius (111.2°F), just 0.2 degrees Celsius below the highest March temperature ever recorded in the nation, according to weather records expert Maximiliano Herrera. The day of the sandstorm (March 23), Luxor, Egypt, hit 43.6 degrees Celsius – just 0.6 degrees Celsius below the March national record. Herrera documented that on the day after the sandstorm, Mitribah, Kuwait hit 44.6 degrees Celsius (112.3°F) – the hottest temperature ever recorded in the Arabian Peninsula in March.\n\nExtreme heat dries the soil, allowing winds to more readily mobilize sand grains and create a dust storm. For example, a study of a high-impact sandstorm over the Middle East during August-September 2015 found that unusually hot and dry conditions preceding the event were responsible for its near-record intensity.\n\n“The simulations showed that what was very unique about this storm is that, first, it was preceded by a very hot period, and so the land that was not covered with vegetation would be drier and it would be easier to entrain sand grains from it,” said study co-author Eli Bou-Zeid, in an interview with the Climate News Network.\n\nSimilarly, when the strong cold front swept through Egypt on March 23, 2021, the winds behind the front were able to loft an unusual amount of dust and sand into the air because of the earlier hot conditions. That created difficult circumstances for navigation on the Suez Canal. Climate change is increasing the incidence of such extreme heat events, and may have played a role in the blockage of the Suez Canal if reduced visibility is determined to have played a role in the ship’s grounding.\n\nFigure 4. The GFS model analysis from 6 UTC March 23, 2021, at the time of the grounding of the Ever Given, showing the departure of temperature from average. Temperatures were as much as 20 degrees Celsius (36°F) above average to the east of a cold front moving across Egypt. (Image credit: Tropical Tidbits)\n\nWind a more likely culprit than poor visibility\n\nWind appears to be the main culprit for the grounding of the ship, however, with the sandstorm’s strong and variable winds making it more difficult to navigate the passage. For now at least, it’s speculative whether climate change may have increased the odds of the strong wind event on March 23.\n\nHowever, the large-scale weather pattern responsible for the sandstorm was quite extreme, and climate change could have contributed to make this event more extreme. Observations of the upper-level air patterns at 500 millibars (about 18,000 feet) on that date showed a very amplified and wavy jet stream pattern, with a strong ridge of high pressure over the Middle East and a strong trough of low pressure just to its west over the central Mediterranean Sea (Figure 5). Both features were about two standard deviations from the mean.\n\nThere has been a sharp increase in similar “global weirding” extreme jet stream patterns in summer, as a result of a phenomenon known as quasi-resonant amplification or “QRA” – described in detail in an October 2018 realclimate.org post by Michael Mann and reported in this writer’s 2018 post at Weather Underground. Modeling studies have shown that climate change may be responsible for the observed increase in summer QRA events, potentially because of how the Arctic is warming up more than twice as fast as the planet overall. A March 2021 study, “Large scale connection to deadly Indian heat waves” found that QRA events can also occur in spring, and may be connected to deadly April and May heat waves that affected India in 2010-2015.\n\nBut Dr. Stefan Rahmstorf, a co-author of the 2018 QRA study, wrote in an email that there was no evidence of QRA conditions during the week leading up to the Suez Canal sandstorm on March 23. Dr. Mann, lead author of the 2018 QRA study, added, “Our work certainly supports the increased incidence of persistent weather extremes of this sort (in fact, there’s a new study just out that further confirms that these events are indeed increasing in Europe during the warm season), so the connection is plausible but not confirmed.” Thus, it is possible that climate change may have increased the odds of the unusually amplified jet stream pattern responsible for the March 23 wind event in Egypt, but this possibility is speculative, and only more research may lead to further understanding of a possible connection with a changing climate.\n\nFigure 5.

Colors show how much the predicted 500-mb height deviates from the average for this time of year, in standard deviations. Ridges of high pressures are shown in orange, and troughs of low pressure are blue; Egypt was located at the boundary between a strong trough of low pressure and strong ridge of high pressure. (Image credit: Tropical Tidbits)\n\nClimate change increasingly likely to threaten global trade chokepoints\n\nWhile the connections to climate change of the grounding of the Ever Given and closure of the Suez Canal are speculative, the event serves as a warning that climate change can be expected to cause an increase in extreme events that will impact critical global trade chokepoints. As explained in a 2017 report from Chatham House, much of the food required to feed 2.8 billion people passes through 14 critical shipping chokepoints (Figure 6): maritime corridors such as straits and canals, coastal infrastructure in major crop-exporting regions, and inland transport infrastructure in major crop-exporting regions. These chokepoints are at risk of closure due to three factors:\n\n1) Extreme weather events or sea level rise;\n\n2) Security and conflict hazards from war, political instability, piracy, organized crime and/or terrorism; and\n\n3) Decisions by authorities to close a chokepoint or restrict the passage of food (for example, by imposing export controls).\n\nThirteen of the 14 critical chokepoints have had a closure or interruption in transit at least once between 2002-2017, with the Strait of Gibraltar the only exception. Many of these events had potential climate change connections: for example, the 2011 and 2012 heat waves in the U.S. that led to multiple derailments of trains where railroad tracks warped in excessive heat.\n\nFigure 6. Key global chokepoints for shipping. (Image credit: Chatham House, adapted from Rodrigue, J.-P., Comtois, C. and Slack, B., 2017, “The Geography of Transport Systems,” New York: Routledge\n\nThe report explained, “Climate change is increasing the threat of disruption by acting as a hazard multiplier across all three categories of chokepoint risk. It will increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather, leading to more regular closures of chokepoints and greater wear and tear on infrastructure. Rising sea levels will threaten the integrity of port operations and coastal storage infrastructure, and will increase their vulnerability to storm surges. Climate change is expected to aggravate drivers of conflict and instability. It will also lead to more frequent harvest failures, increasing the risk of governments imposing ad hoc export controls.”\n\nThe forced closure of the Suez Canal due to a possibly climate change-related event should act as a warning: Climate change will cause disruptions to critical global trade chokepoints more frequently in the coming years, and we need to take strong actions to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and reduce vulnerabilities to chokepoint disruptions.\n\nWebsite visitors can comment on “Eye on the Storm” posts (see below).

        "content": "Britain has announced plans to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 before the next national election\n\nBritain will lower its voting age to 16 in a bid to strengthen democracy\n\nLONDON -- Britain will lower the voting age from 18 to 16 before the next national election as part of measures to increase democratic participation, the government announced Thursday.\n\nThe center-left Labour Party pledged before it was elected in July 2024 to lower the voting age for elections to Britain's Parliament. Scotland and Wales already let 16- and 17-year-olds vote in local and regional elections.\n\nBritain will join the short list of countries where the voting age is 16, alongside the likes of Ecuador, Austria and Brazil.\n\nThe move comes alongside wider reforms that include tightening campaign financing rules to stop shell companies with murky ownership from donating to political parties. Democracy Minister Rushanara Ali said the change would strengthen safeguards against foreign interference in British politics.\n\nThe government also said it will introduce automatic voter registration and allow voters to use bank cards as a form of identification at polling stations.\n\nThe previous Conservative government introduced a requirement for voters to show photo identification in 2022, a measure it said would combat fraud. Critics argued it could disenfranchise millions of voters, particularly the young, the poor and members of ethnic minorities.\n\nElections watchdog the Electoral Commission has estimated that about 750,000 people did not vote in last year’s election because they lacked ID.\n\nTurnout in the 2024 election was 59.7%, the lowest level in more than two decades.\n\nHarry Quilter-Pinner, head of left-leaning think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research, said the changes were “the biggest reform to our electoral system since 1969,\" when the voting age was lowered to 18 from 21.\n\nThe changes must be approved by Parliament. The next national election must be held by 2029.\n\n“For too long public trust in our democracy has been damaged and faith in our institutions has been allowed to decline,” Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said. “We are taking action to break down barriers to participation that will ensure more people have the opportunity to engage in U.K. democracy.”",

        "content": "After a half century as senator and vice president, Joe Biden will assume the presidency at a time of health, economic and societal crises.\n\nJoseph Robinette Biden Jr. was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday, assuming office amid several crises after routing a predecessor who fought to stay in power, and clearing the way for a beleaguered nation to turn the page on one of the most divisive chapters in its political history.\n\nBefore taking his oath on the Capitol’s West Front, Biden saw a historic barrier shattered as Kamala Harris, formerly a senator from California, was sworn in as the first woman, Black person and South Asian American to become vice president. Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina Supreme Court justice, administered Harris’ oath.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Biden tried to rally the country to meet the historic challenges of COVID-19, a struggling economy, racial tensions and political divisions that have provoked violence and death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“To overcome these challenges, to restore the soul and secure the future of America, requires so much more than words and requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy: unity,” the new Democratic president said.\n\nCalling for unity is an inaugural staple, but Biden’s appeal resonated due to the country’s dire straits. He plainly was banking on Americans’ desire to transcend politics and find ways to quell extremists’ violence, control the pandemic, rebuild the economy and, even for some Republicans, put the Trump era behind them.\n\nWithout ever naming former President Trump in his 21-minute address, Biden made pointed note of the lingering damage from his predecessor’s postelection campaign to stay in power, which tested the foundations of democracy — damage that was literally evident in places throughout the Capitol, which had been violently invaded just 14 days before by supporters of the outgoing Republican president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We have learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile, and at this hour, democracy has prevailed,” the new president said.\n\nStill, Biden’s message most likely fell flat among the many Republicans who, swayed by Trump’s false claims that the election was rigged against him, refuse to accept the legitimacy of Biden’s presidency.\n\n“At this moment, we are a divided country,” said Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), one of those in Congress who backed Trump’s efforts to overturn the election result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden’s address, while urging conciliation, was laden with stinging implied indictments of his predecessor’s legacy.\n\n“We must reject the culture where facts themselves are manipulated, even manufactured,” he said, calling for a change of political culture, so that people could disagree without “this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal.”\n\n“We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts,” he went on, “if we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we’re willing to stand in the other person’s shoes.”\n\nAnd Biden spoke directly to Trump’s supporters: “To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out, as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart.”\n\nIn a slap at Trump’s style of leadership, which was laser-focused on appealing to his political base, Biden said, “I pledge this to you: I will be a president for all Americans.”\n\nCongressional Republicans were complimentary of Biden’s address, but his words likely will fade once lawmakers turn their attention to policy details.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It was a good speech, and I hope that, in terms of serving as president, he sticks with that,” said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), who immediately raised concerns about an executive order Biden was about to sign canceling Trump’s approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. “It was a speech of unity, and it’s important to govern that way as well.”\n\nWithin hours of taking the oath, the new president signed that order and more, dramatizing the change in direction and reversing some of Trump’s most controversial federal policies. Biden issued executive orders on the environment, immigration and other issues, moving to rejoin the Paris climate agreement, rescind Trump’s order for the deportation of young immigrants known as Dreamers, reenter the World Health Organization and overhaul Trump’s restrictionist immigration policies.\n\nLingering partisan tensions were a subtext in a post-inaugural event inside the Capitol, where congressional leaders gave gifts to Biden and Harris.\n\n“As leaders we are judged not by our words but by our actions,” said House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield, who was one of Trump’s most loyal supporters and voted just after the Capitol siege to challenge Biden’s electoral college victory. “Let’s go forth from here together — accomplish great things.”\n\nA few hours earlier, Trump had left Washington for Florida, making one last trip from Joint Base Andrews on Air Force One to West Palm Beach after a small farewell rally at the airport. In doing so, he broke one last norm — dispensing with the 152-year-old rituals of a peaceful transfer of power by declining to greet his successor at the White House and then attend the inauguration.\n\nAddressing a smaller crowd than expected of family members, aides and supporters, Trump said, “This has been an incredible four years. We’ve accomplished so much together.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We will be back in some form,” Trump said in closing, seeming to hint as he has before of perhaps seeking the presidency again in 2024. Then, at 8:59 a.m., Air Force One lifted off.\n\nTrump did adhere to one tradition: He left a note for his successor at the White House. Biden declined to divulge Trump’s message except to describe it as “very generous.”\n\nMoments after the outgoing president and First Lady Melania Trump waved and disappeared into the plane to depart, the president-elect and wife Jill Biden went to the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle for morning Mass, a reminder that for only the second time in history the nation has a Roman Catholic leader.\n\nThe church service allowed Biden to start his day with the show of bipartisanship that Trump denied him. Joining him at Mass were Congress’ top Republicans — McCarthy and Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who declined to attend Trump’s sendoff, underscoring the isolation of the final days of his presidency.\n\nAmong the Republicans attending the inauguration ceremony was former House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who had often been at odds with Trump but rarely spoke up to criticize him.\n\n“Our institutions were tested this year and our institutions passed the test. I’m here out of respect for the peaceful transfer of power and for the institutions,” Ryan said, adding, “Joe Biden is the legitimately elected president of the United States and I’m here to honor this process.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRarely has a new president had less need for an orientation to the White House: Biden, at 78 the oldest man to become president, brings to the job 44 years of governing experience as a senator and vice president. He has run for president three times in the last 33 years. Now he takes on the job of his dreams, but at a nightmarish time of health, economic and societal crises.\n\nHe took the oath with his hand on a family Bible that he used for swearing-in ceremonies as vice president and senator, an heirloom that has been in his family since 1893. The entire spectacle set a markedly different tone than the event four years ago, when Trump in his inaugural address evoked a dark vision of “American carnage” — a country racked by poverty, industrial decline, drugs and crime.\n\nBiden’s view from the Capitol, looking across the National Mall to the Washington Monument, was devoid of the hundreds of thousands typically in attendance. The crowd limitations were not only a precaution against spreading the coronavirus that has led to more than 400,000 U.S. deaths, but also a safeguard against continued threats of violence by pro-Trump extremists.\n\nAn unprecedented deployment of military and law enforcement personnel stood guard, turning the area around the ceremonial site and the city beyond into a virtual armed encampment.\n\nFor the first time in history, the incoming president was joined on the inaugural platform by a vice president who is not a white man — a pivotal moment for a nation still struggling to end racial disparities. It was especially poignant for Black women who have been a vital if underappreciated force in the Democratic Party.\n\nRep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland) said the ascension of her longtime friend Harris to national office was “just a remarkable historic moment for me.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Black women have fought so hard to elect other people, to be part of this Democratic Party, to get people out to vote,” Lee said. “We never would be here had it not been for the work and the struggle and the fights” of Black women.\n\nThe dignitaries in attendance included three former presidents — Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton — along with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 race to Trump. While Trump stayed away, his vice president, Mike Pence, showed up.\n\nThe ceremony, which began with a light snow falling, featured a lineup of celebrity performers, including Jennifer Lopez, Garth Brooks and Lady Gaga.\n\nAs Lady Gaga sang an unconventional rendition of the national anthem, the sun emerged, and it stayed out to shine as Biden spoke.\n\nYet reminders of the threat of violence were everywhere: Some House members wore body armor. Harris was escorted by Eugene Goodman, the Capitol Police officer newly famous after videos showed him defending the Senate on Jan. 6 as rioters swarmed after him.\n\n“It’s on one hand heartbreaking,” said Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), “and on the other a very poignant reminder of the fragility of democracy.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTimes staff writers Eli Stokols and Sarah D. Wire contributed to this report.",

        "content": "While some would like us to believe that “all’s quiet on the election front”, multipoint attacks are underway with just 17 months until 2026’s voting and less time before off-year elections this November. Awareness of the attacks – and those fortifying trustworthy processes – is crucial for defending democracy.\n\nWhile Donald Trump’s July 2024 statement may not be a MAGA roadmap, it remains a threat to free and fair elections that should be heeded: “We’ll have it fixed so good, you're not going to have to vote”. Just as there was Project 2025, we can be certain that there is a project to maintain and expand power by “fixing” elections or perhaps even keeping power despite them.\n\nEffects of the Political Environment\n\nAmerican elections are taking place in an increasingly bellicose political environment, amid a presidential power grab. The deployment of military troops to Los Angeles despite opposition from its Mayor and Governor, threats to use “ very big force ” against protests of Trumps’ June 14th military parade, and tactics used in stepped up immigration raids in cities aimed to break Democratic power centers portend a more confrontational atmosphere as the summer and pre-election periods develop.\n\nPower grabbing includes: subverting judicial and congressional checks and balances; prodding for an anti-constitutional third presidential term; pressuring news media, law firms, judges, and universities to tow the line politically; issuing executive orders that undermine trustworthy elections; as well as targeting political “enemies”. Such enemies encompass officials who told the truth about the 2020 presidential election and others currently working to protect voting rights.\n\nThose factors are mixing with five years of Big-Lie propaganda claiming that the 2020 presidential race was stolen – a fabrication that is still being propagated , including by people in key roles in the Administration. Repeating the falsehood is part of justifying current actions and softening the ground for false claims about future MAGA election losses.\n\nAdded to the mix is hype around the fiction that voting by non-citizens is a significant threat that warrants overly burdensome proof of citizenship and other barriers to exercising voting rights. Such barriers are incorporated into the SAVE Act, state bills, and EO 14248, the presidential executive order on elections. MAGA-related groups like True The Vote and Election Integrity Network are using such issues to develop local organizations that are advocating for voting barriers and questioning electoral processes. Plus, election officials continue to face harassment and threats, as are many judges.\n\nIn short, we are living in a distressed election environment that is under siege and in need of reinforcements. That includes robust, honest journalism, truthful sources speaking out across social and other digital platforms, community forums that bridge divides where possible, and broad citizen engagement. Fortunately, there are such efforts that merit attention and support.\n\nDefending Constitutional Electoral Protections\n\nIrrespective of notable shortcomings in the electoral arena, the U.S. Constitution protects against the presidential usurpation of electoral powers. Article I, Section 4 is explicit: “The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.…”\n\nThere is no constitutional role for a president to dictate electoral rules, and Article II’s definition of a president’s powers requires an oath to “preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States,” not subvert it under the pretext of executing laws passed by Congress or to address fabricated crises .\n\nYet, President Trump has done just that and will likely try to dictate more rules favoring MAGA power – and MAGA congressional actions, such as those through the SAVE Act or otherwise, could clear the way.\n\nPresident Trump’s Executive Order 14248 , ironically titled “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of Elections”, overrides constitutional powers provided to the states and Congress. It offends the principle of universal and equal suffrage by creating unwarranted barriers to voting in person and by mail, requires unworkable electoral administration actions, breaches citizen privacy rights, and mobilizes the Department of Justice (DOJ) for political advantage. It thus illustrates important elements of the MAGA elections project.\n\nThe Order overlooks that the Federal Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is an independent body established by Congress as a nonpartisan entity. An earlier Executive Order ( 14215 ) claims the power to negate the independence of agencies like the EAC, Federal Election Commission ( FEC ), and Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which also has an electoral impact . And, the Supreme Court’s decision in Kennedy v. Braidwood Management could also undermine their independence . In addition, the FEC’s federal campaign finance oversight role is also being obstructed by an orchestrated quorum deficiency .\n\nIf the EAC and other independent agencies created by Congress are allowed to become political tools of the presidency, future Executive Orders could easily be issued to tilt the electoral playing field or even interfere in determining election results. Court actions to limit such orders would be curtailed if the MAGA congressional agenda is enacted . Plus, the power of lower federal courts to restrain such actions was severely limited by the recent Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v CASA . At the outer edge of the interference spectrum, declaring emergencies and deploying military force to protect those “performing federal functions” should such vaguely defined actions become normalized.\n\nAttorneys general from 19 states are suing in federal court seeking to block many provisions of EO 14248. On June 13, the court issued a preliminary injunction against five subsections of the EO, though several harmful provisions of the EO remain unaddressed. Two of the subsections addressed concerned proof of citizenship, which a different court also enjoined. The ruling restrained three other provisions: a constraint on military voting; the US Attorney General enforcing the EO’s Election Day mail ballot deadline; and instruction to the EAC to condition funding to states on their accepting that deadline (though EO Section 4(a) on withholding EAC funding was not addressed).\n\nWhile further proceedings and appeals will follow, the suit illustrates the importance of attorneys general in defending constitutional protections. That role is heightened by Trump v. CASA decision, which restricts lower federal courts from issuing universal (i.e., nationwide) preliminary injunctions except in very limited circumstances where “complete relief” is necessary for the specific parties to the case (e.g., to states that are plaintiffs) or broad relief is gained through class action cases that are expensive and slow moving. The impact of the CASA decision in the election arena, where swift court action is crucial, could be detrimental.\n\nProof of Citizenship Requirements Disenfranchises Eligible Voters\n\nSection 2(a) of EO 14248 instructs the EAC to modify its national mail voter registration form to include documented proof of citizenship , which would unnecessarily block large numbers of eligible voters from registering and burden state and local officials with onerous record-keeping of details. The EO’s acceptable documents only include a US passport, Real ID , or a military, state, or federal photo ID that indicates US citizenship. According to the State Department ’s 2024 data, just under 50% of the total US population holds a valid passport, and this percentage applies to voters, excluding duplicate holders and children.\n\nThe list does not include a birth certificate, which is often the basis for the listed IDs, thus manufacturing a likely two-stage process. Obtaining a government-certified birth certificate itself can be expensive and time-consuming, and thus can be a voting barrier to potentially millions of people . Such barriers particularly affect young people and minority communities.\n\nThe Order’s Section 2(d) requires federal agencies like the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of the Interior to assess citizenship before providing the federal voter registration form to persons in public assistance programs.\n\nState officials would need to modify voter registration databases and take other measures within an unrealistic timeframe to comply with using the revised federal registration form. The Order also requires the FEC to cut funding to states that do not, among other matters, use the form, though Congress authorized such funding.\n\nThe proof of citizenship requirements in Sections 2(a) and (d) were preliminarily enjoined by a federal court ruling in response to a suit brought by the League of Latin American Citizens (LULAC), League of Women Voters, Democratic National Committee, and others. This ruling will also now work its way through further hearings and appeals in light of the Trump v. CASA ruling, while federal and state legislative proof-of-citizenship requirements remain part of the electoral battlefield.\n\nThe SAVE Act – which may soon come to a Senate vote – does many of the same things as EO 14248, including codifying proof of citizenship for voting and putting unrealistic, unfunded demands on election officials . Plus, the right-wing American Legislative Exchange Council’s ( ALEC ) new Process and Procedures Taskforce is promoting to state legislatures the SAVE Act and other voting restrictions, as are efforts like the August 2025 “ Only Citizens Vote Month ” lobbying campaign by the Tea Party Patriots. Countering such efforts through education and mobilization are pro-voter organizations, including the Brennan Center , IssueOne , the Center for American Progress ( CAP ), and VoteRiders .\n\nThe MAGA election attacks are also being launched on other fronts. Some spring from additional provisions of EO 14248. The salvos entail weaponizing the Justice Department, including its Voting Rights Section, as well as assaults on the courts and other facets of trustworthy elections, which are explored in parts two and three of this series. They emphasize the urgency of building an effective defensive effort that requires taking a position on the ramparts.\n\nPart Two, which will be published on Saturday, July 12, examines the detrimental effects of Executive Orders, the reversal of the Justice Department's stance on voting rights, and the consequences of political retribution.\n\nPat Merloe provides strategic advice to groups focused on democracy and trustworthy elections in the U.S. and internationally.",

        "content": "President Biden’s Inaugural Address Gave America Reassurance and Hope\n\nInauguration Day President Biden’s Inaugural Address Gave America Reassurance and Hope BU’s Thomas Whalen on the substance and the symbolism of the speech and the ceremony\n\nWith Jill Biden holding the Bible, Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th US president by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts at the 2021 presidential inauguration, held at the US Capitol January 20. Moments before, Kamala Harris was sworn in as vice president by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, while Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, held the Bible. Biden photo, AP Photo/Andrew Harnik; Harris photo, Saul Loeb/Pool Photo via AP\n\nPresident Joe Biden told the nation exactly what it needed to hear in his inaugural address on Wednesday—a message of reassurance, honesty, and hope, says BU historian Thomas Whalen.\n\nA College of General Studies associate professor of social sciences, Whalen specializes in 19th- and 20th-century American social and political history, which has made him a sought-after expert for local media during these tumultuous months of impeachment, election, and insurrection.\n\nBU Today asked Whalen for his thoughts on President Joe Biden’s inaugural address, how the whole thing looked on TV, and what he thinks about the future of American democracy now that Donald J. Trump has left town.\n\nQ & A With Thomas Whalen BU Today: Give us your review of the inauguration’s substance, particularly Biden’s speech and what it tells us about how he’ll govern. Thomas Whalen: There were no real details. He was, as presidents usually do at inaugurations, giving broad strokes. It wasn’t a roadmap to where they’re going to take their administration—it was almost like a prayer. The speech was very plainspoken, and given from the heart, really quintessential Joe Biden. He was trying to be hopeful, yet realistic at the same time. Sprinkled throughout the speech was a spirit of generosity, or empathy, given everything that has happened in this country over the last few weeks. I think this is a tone that has been sorely lacking at the White House for the last four years. That message alone is a huge contrast to Trump’s “American carnage” four years ago.\n\n\n\nA lot of people are saying the speech was Lincolnesque, reaching across the aisle, binding our nation’s wounds. It had elements of that, but I looked more to Franklin Roosevelt. Biden’s underlying message—given the pandemic, the economic collapse, the insurrection—was that we can’t be fearful as Americans. One of Roosevelt’s great points was his optimism, especially as he took over the country in the depths of the Great Depression in 1933, when it looked like our very democracy, our republic, was going to fall.\n\n\n\nWhat Joe Biden was saying here was “freedom from fear.” He was taking the nation’s hand and squeezing it and saying it’s going to be all right. And we need that as a nation right now. And I think the speech delivered that. In terms of rhetoric, it wasn’t even as good as George W. Bush’s. But it did its job. Joe Biden is a smart enough politician to kind of throw away flowery rhetoric and get to the point—what do people want to hear? Given recent events, they want reassurance. And honesty, which was another touchstone of his speech. He’s saying, I’m going to be straight with you. What’s come before has been kind of a war on truth. He went out of his way to embrace reason, and compromise.\n\nLady Gaga performs the National Anthem at President Joe Biden’s January 20 inauguration. Photo by Greg Nash/Pool Photo via AP\n\nBU Today: OK, that’s the substance. But this is also politics, where pomp and circumstance and symbolism matter. What’s your take on how the inauguration played out on TV? Because there’s no audience there, it’s all for television, and I think it did well. The president was kind of upstaged by the former National Youth Poet Laureate, Amanda Gorman. She’s going to be remembered for what she said, and I think that might be the only time in history that’s ever happened at an inaugural. We had some showstoppers there. I mean, Lady Gaga was terrific. I thought, J Lo—what a performance. And they represented a huge array of Americans. They looked like America, not a bunch of stuffed suits. Which was especially appropriate on a day when we have Kamala Harris, our first woman and first woman of color being sworn in as vice president.\n\n\n\nEven Garth Brooks, wearing the hat. I can hear my late mother: “Who does he think he is! This is supposed to be a solemn affair.” But we need that kind of light touch.\n\n\n\nThe pageantry was all there, and it was also important that you had Vice President Mike Pence there. It shows that this is the punctuation mark to a peaceful transition of power. And you also had Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) there. Albeit sitting stonily, but at least he showed up. And we had Republican and Democratic presidents there. This was stage-managed to show that no matter what, we are all still Americans.\n\n\n\nBut I think there was a warning sign not to get too carried away here. Garth Brooks gave a great performance, but automatically, in the Twitterverse he was being criticized by his fan base. “How could you perform at Joe Biden’s inaugural?” That to me says it’s good that Joe Biden talked about unity, but there’s still a lot of work to be done.\n\nAir Force One, with the outgoing president, Donald Trump, and his family on board, departs Andrews Air Force Base Wednesday morning. AP Photo/Luis M. Alvarez\n\nBU Today: You said you weren’t able to watch Trump’s departure in the morning, but what do you think of him making an early exit from Washington instead of attending the ceremony? He came in as an outsider and leaves, quite literally, as an outsider, shorn of even his closest supporters in Washington, D.C. Even Kevin McCarthy and Ted Cruz, his staunchest supporters in fighting the certification of Biden’s victory, even they showed up at the inaugural. It reminds me of what Lyndon Johnson said: “Power is where power goes.” That has never changed in Washington.\n\n\n\nNow Trump goes off to Florida, and it kind of reminded me of an old banana republic dictator sneaking off into exile. But according to the Wall Street Journal, he apparently has plans for starting a new party, the Patriot Party, because he’s so upset with the Republicans. And if you’re the Democrats, you’re doing handstands right now, because that’s going to divide the vote that usually goes to the Republican Party, which would guarantee Democratic successes at the ballot box.\n\n\n\nBut part of the poisonous legacy of Trump—and this is what concerns me most for the future of democracy—is that he has kind of laid out a blueprint on how to overturn fair and free democratic elections. If the Republicans were in charge in the House of Representatives, there is no doubt in my mind that Joe Biden’s victory would not have been certified. They would have overturned it and thrown it to Trump. And that would have caused a crisis that would have made what happened on Capitol Hill on January 6 look like a pillow fight. I fear that now that’s possible; let’s hope we never get to the brink again. It just underscores that we have to get rid of the Electoral College, an archaic instrument that serves no purpose in a country that has embraced full-on democracy. BU Today: You’ve been very busy of late, your analysis sought by all kinds of media, including this one. Any plans to take a couple of weeks off? This month has been especially crazy, but really, since the election it’s been a full-on sprint to the finish. But I have to teach starting on Monday. It’s almost as if teaching is going to be my vacation, but that’s OK, because the students always revitalize me. If I’m feeling down or lacking energy, just getting into the classroom, even if it’s a hybrid, always recharges my batteries. That’s what I’m hoping. We’ll see.",

Since the pandemic began early last year, the disease has killed more than 400,000 people in the United States.\n\nThe first members of Biden's Cabinet are slated to be sworn in over the next few days, as well, including Janet Yellen as Treasury secretary. Biden's Democratic Party, likewise, will assume a bare majority in the Senate after three new lawmakers – Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia, and Alex Padilla of California – also take their oaths of office.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, faces his second impeachment trial in the Senate, even though he will be out of power. The Democratic-controlled House, with the help of 10 Republicans, charged Trump with inciting the insurrection at the Capitol. The trial could begin this week.\n\nTrump, in his farewell address, glossed over the Capitol riot, which resulted in five deaths. He did not mention Biden by name in the speech.\n\nHere's what you need to know right now",

If Proposition 1 passes, the property tax will raise $4.5 million a year for 10 years, up from the current annual amount of $3 million.\n\nThe tax will be levied at a rate of $0.0142 per $1,000 of assessed value, according to the Seattle Ethics and Election Commission. That means the owner of a home assessed at $1 million would pay $14.20 a year for the tax.\n\nThe goal of the program is to increase participation and political sway for everyday Seattleites, reducing the influence of a small pool of wealthy donors who typically dominate American political fundraising.\n\nEvery election cycle, Seattle residents get four $25 vouchers to distribute to participating candidates running for local office. Candidates can receive the vouchers if they pledge to abide by campaign fundraising and spending limits.\n\nCandidates must also first collect signatures and donations of at least $10 from Seattle residents to qualify to collect vouchers. The number required varies by office. For example, a mayoral candidate needs 600 signatures and donations to qualify.\n\nProponents of the program argue it’s been successful in its stated goals of increasing small-donor participation in local politics and diversifying the range of donors.\n\n“At a time of deep national concern about the health of our democracy, Seattle can lead by example,” the Yes on Prop 1 campaign wrote in the King County Elections voter guide. “For about $13 a year per median homeowner, we can empower everyday people to support candidates they believe in — even if they can’t afford to give. Eliminating democracy vouchers would reverse the progress we’ve made — just as billionaires pour more money into elections across the country.”\n\nThe pro statement was written by King County Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda and Estevan Muñoz-Howard, who worked on the 2015 initiative to create Democracy Vouchers.\n\nOpponents argue that program participation has been too small to justify its continued cost. They also say it fails to reduce big money’s influence on Seattle elections, since outside spending by big PACs has continued. In 2021, the election with the highest Democracy Voucher participation so far, PACs spent more than $2 million on the mayor’s race alone.\n\n“Seattle’s Democracy Voucher Program is inefficient, underutilized, and fails to curb big money’s influence. Seattleites are forced to pay a tax, in an already unaffordable city, to fund political campaigns where most of the money doesn’t even get used. The city should return the money to the taxpayers. Let’s start by ending the program,” Ari Hoffman wrote in the voter guide opposition statement. Hoffman is a former City Council candidate and conservative media figure.\n\nResearchers from Georgetown and Stony Brook universities analyzed Seattle’s Democracy Voucher program from 2017-2023. They found that the number of voting-age residents donating vouchers increased steadily from 2017-2021 before dropping off in 2023, a reduction they attributed to a combination of lesser interest in district Council elections and post-pandemic political fatigue.\n\nIn 2017, the first election year for the program, just over 20,000 people gave vouchers. In 2019, that number rose to 38,000, or 6.76% of voting-aged Seattleites. The program hit its high-water mark in 2021 with 48,000 participants, or 7.59%. In 2023, that number dropped to just 30,649 participants, or 4.72%.\n\nSightline Institute, a think tank that helped design the 2015 ballot initiative, points out that though those percentages are low, just 1.5% of Seattle adults donated to campaigns in 2013, a mayoral election year.\n\nSightline also argued that the program has been successful in shifting the size of political donations and reducing out-of-state donating. In 2013, about 60% of donations were $400 or more. In 2023, donations of $400 or more accounted for 13% of campaign contributions, with 69% of contributions falling in the $100-$399 range.\n\nIn 2015, 28.6% of donations came from out of state. That percentage fell steadily in subsequent election cycles, down to 12.9% in 2021 and 7.4% in 2023.\n\nThe Georgetown and Stony Brook researchers found that participation in the Democracy Voucher program largely mirrors existing patterns of political participation in Seattle, with higher-income residents participating at higher rates than low-income residents, white people at higher rates than people of color, and older Seattleites more than younger ones.\n\nBut the researchers also noted that Democracy Vouchers increased political donations across demographic categories including income, race and gender relative to cash donations.\n\n“Democracy Voucher users are more representative of all Seattle voters than cash donors,” the report concludes. “This pattern suggests that — even though participation declined sharply in 2023 — the program continues to make progress in diversifying the donor pool.”\n\nData from the city shows that administration costs for the Democracy Voucher program are about $1.4 million in election years and $650,000 in non-election years. Candidate disbursements vary from cycle to cycle. In 2021, the program disbursed $3.4 million to candidates. In 2023, that amount dropped to $2.4 million.\n\nMoney from non-election years is saved for election years when the program costs more than the funding raised by the levy. According to the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission, any money raised by the levy stays within the Democracy Voucher program and is not used elsewhere in the city budget.\n\nIn a presentation to the City Council in March, city staff explained that the jump from $3 million to $4.5 million annually is meant to offset inflation and increased administrative overhead costs.\n\nBallots for the primary must be returned by August 5 at 8 p.m.",

        "content": "Democracy is universal - and African: this is the premise of Senegalese journalist Ousmane Ndiaye's book “Africa against democracy: myths, denial, dangers”.\n\nThe text, released in French on 10 July, retraces the current crisis of democracy in numerous African countries, where, according to the journalist and former editor-in-chief of French TV channel TV5 Monde's Africa desk, leaders are embracing a rhetoric that overtly and officially \"rejects democracy\".\n\nNot only military regimes\n\nOne facet of the problem is what Ndiaye calls the \"khaki danger\", the numerous military regimes that have come to power or ensured they stay in power in recent years.\n\nSince 2020, nine military coups have been successful, with most taking place in West Africa and in particular the \"Sahelian coup belt\", as some analysts term it.\n\nAssimi Goita, initally transitional leader of Mali, earlier this month signed into law a change to the presidential term that would allow him to stay in power without having been elected until at least 2030 - and likely beyond.\n\nHis counterparts in neighbouring Niger and Burkina Faso are also former coup leaders clad in uniform - and on their way to cement their grip on power.\n\nBut Ndiaye warns: it is not only generals and colonels who reject democracy, citing for instance the dubious argument of counter-terrorism or an unstable security situation.\n\n\"Take someone like Kaïs Saïd in Tunisia. He was democratically elected and nevertheless, his rhetoric casts doubts over democracy in the name of being against the system,\" says Ndiaye.\n\nDemocracy as a colonial product\n\nDemocracy is a Western concept: this is the notion that needs to be rejected immediately, says the author.\n\n\"In many places in Africa, there were forms of democracy that preceded the colonial era\", he says.\n\nThe brutality of the colonial systems in many ways destroyed these egalitarian forms of governance and societal organisation, and led to an imposition of a Western and artifical way of democratising countries in the post-colonial period.\n\n\"Until now, what did we get in Africa? Democratisation processes coming from above or from outside. This is what I call a process of democratic evangelisation, which doesn't work,\" Ndiaye points out.\n\nWith his book, Ndiaye seeks to \"re-universalise\" democracy and shows that, although the way forward is lined with dangers - propaganda, repression of popular protest, an obsession with the West that is counterproductive to advancing the fight for democracy - there is hope: the joint force of citizens seeking freedom and equality.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden ended his first day in office with a note of hope and optimism, closing his inaugural activities with an appearance at the Lincoln Memorial on Wednesday night, where he asked the nation to answer his call for unity, saying it will require “us to come together in common love that defines us as Americans.”\n\n“We’ve learned again that democracy is precious. Because of you, democracy has prevailed,” Biden said, alluding to the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, which was incited by former President Donald Trump’s lies about a stolen election but which did not stop a peaceful transfer of power on Wednesday.\n\nLive Updates: The inauguration of Joe Biden\n\nBut Biden noted that the nation is facing myriad challenges, including the pandemic, the recession, last year’s calls for racial justice and equality after the police killing of George Floyd, the climate crisis and the attack on the country’s system of government two weeks ago.\n\n“The question is: Are we up to it?” the President asked. “Will we meet the moment like our forbearers have? I believe we must and I believe we will. You the American people are the reason why. I’ve never been more optimistic about America than I am this very day. There isn’t anything we can’t do if we do it together.”\n\nAfter Trump had refused to formally concede or host Biden at the White House in the morning, Biden and his family walked onto the White House grounds for the first time since he won the election Wednesday afternoon, as did Kamala Harris – who made history Wednesday when she was sworn in as the first female, the first Black and first South Asian vice president of the United States.\n\nKamala Harris is sworn in as vice president as her husband, Doug Emhoff, holds the Bible. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nJust hours after he was inaugurated as the 46th President, Biden signed 17 executive actions to begin overhauling the nation’s approach to the coronavirus pandemic – including instituting a mask mandate for federal buildings and inter-state travel – and undoing some of the Trump administration’s most controversial policies, like rejoining the Paris climate accord and rescinding Trump’s ban on travelers from predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nBiden told reporters he was starting his term “keeping the promises” he’d made, as he sat at the Resolute Desk Wednesday evening. But he noted that the nation has “a long way to go” and that Congress would need to pass legislation to follow through on his priorities, which include a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill.\n\nLater that evening, the US Senate confirmed Biden’s first nominee, Avril Haines as director of national intelligence, in bipartisan fashion – approving the nominee 84-10.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki, during her first press briefing, gingerly sidestepped questions about Trump’s looming impeachment trial in the Senate, which could complicate efforts to quickly confirm Biden’s nominees and take up his legislative priorities.\n\nWhen asked whether Democratic leaders in the Senate should drop the trial, Psaki said that Biden is focused on the “importance of unity and bringing the country together,” adding that the President would defer to Senate leaders on questions of timing.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki speaks during her first press briefing at the White House. Evan Vucci/AP\n\nHarris – who is now the tie-breaking vote in a Senate that is divided evenly between Democrats and Republicans – swore in three incoming senators as one of her first acts in her new role. She administered the oath of office to Alex Padilla, who will replace Harris as the junior senator from California. She also swore in Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, who won hard-fought runoff races that flipped control of the Senate, giving Democrats control of Congress and the White House.\n\nTrump had left Washington Wednesday morning, becoming the first president in 150 years to boycott his successor’s inauguration. But he left a letter for Biden, which, during the new President’s brief exchange with reporters Wednesday, he described as “generous” but whose contents he said he would not reveal until he spoke with Trump.\n\nSetting a tone of unity and calm\n\nPresident Joe Biden addresses staff virtually on his first day in the White House.\n\nBiden took his oath of office at the US Capitol just two weeks after a mob of insurrectionists invaded that building seeking to overturn the presidential election. The new President set out on the daunting task of uniting the nation by urging Americans to come together as they confront the deadly pandemic, an economic collapse that has left millions unemployed and deep divisions over issues of racial justice and police brutality.\n\n“Today on this January day, my whole soul is in this — bringing American people together, uniting our nation, and I ask every American to join me in this cause,” Biden said in his inaugural speech.\n\nThe new President set that tone of unity, calm and comity from the top down on a carefully choreographed day that was striking after the chaos and tumult of the past four years under Trump. The former President poisoned already strained relations between the two political parties in Washington, as he lashed out at his political opponents and anyone who dared to criticize him.\n\nBut that cloud over Washington had notably lifted, at least for the day, Wednesday as members from both parties mingled at the Capitol during the ceremonies. Outgoing Vice President Mike Pence, who attended the inauguration and skipped Trump’s farewell ceremony, and his wife Karen even shared a laugh with Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, on the steps of the Capitol before they departed to begin their private lives.\n\nBiden also made it clear that he would not accept infighting, even within his own ranks when he swore in his new staff Wednesday evening.\n\n“If you’re ever working with me and I hear you treating another colleague with disrespect, talking down to someone, I will fire you on the spot,” Biden told his new employees in a virtual address. He said he believes everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and decency, which he said had been “missing in a big way the past four years.”\n\nBiden’s inaugural speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden delivers his inaugural address. Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nDuring his inaugural speech, Biden, who decided to run for the White House after Trump’s shocking reaction to the White supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, noted that the nation is struggling through a rise of White nationalism, racism and deep political divisions.\n\n“Politics doesn’t have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path,” Biden said, calling on Americans to come together. “We have to be different than this. America has to be better than this.”\n\n“I will be a president for all Americans,” Biden said speaking directly to those who did not support him in the November election. “I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as those who did.”\n\nBiden reflected on the siege in the Capitol several times during his speech, noting that the world is watching after its entire system of government come under attack.\n\n“Here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested and we’ve come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again. Not to meet yesterday’s challenges, but today’s and tomorrow’s challenges,” Biden said.\n\nThe new President also said the nation’s success in getting through this moment will hinge on whether Americans can come together and set aside their differences to defeat the pandemic that has ravaged the nation, costing more than 400,000 lives. He highlighted some of the previous challenges the nation has confronted, including the Great Depression, two world wars and the September 11 attacks.\n\n“I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days; I know the forces that divide us are deep and are real, but I also know they are not new,” Biden said in his speech, calling on Americans to forge a new way forward. “We can see each other not as adversaries, but as neighbors —speaking to each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature. Without unity there is no peace, only bitterness and fury; no progress, only exhausting outrage; no nation, only a state of chaos.”\n\nHe asked his audience to unite to meet the moment as one nation: “If we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail.”\n\n“At this time, in this place, let’s start afresh,” Biden said.\n\nAfter a tumultuous year that began a new chapter of the civil rights movement as Americans took to the streets to protest against racial injustice and police brutality after the death of George Floyd, Biden noted that the swearing in of his vice president was a remarkable achievement for a country that has often struggled to live up to its ideal of equality for all.\n\n“Here we stand looking out on the great Mall, where Dr. (Martin Luther) King (Jr.) spoke of his dream. Here we stand where 108 years ago, at another inaugural, thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote. Today, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office, Vice President Kamala Harris,” Biden said.\n\nIn another ceremony highlight, the nation’s first youth poet laureate, Amanda Gorman, recited a poem about bridging divides that she finished on the night that Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol.\n\n“Somehow we’ve weathered and witnessed a nation that isn’t broken, but simply unfinished,” Gorman said in the poem she read after Biden’s speech. “We’ve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it. Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated.”\n\nAmerican poet Amanda Gorman reads a poem during the inauguration. Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nTrump leaves Washington\n\nBiden’s tone at his inaugural speech could not have been more different than the bitter, divisive one adopted by Trump throughout his presidency in his speeches and tweets, which were threaded with lies and threats that whipped up his crowds and ultimately led to the insurrection at the Capitol earlier this month.\n\nThe former president left the White House as president for the last time Wednesday morning, flying to Florida with first lady Melania Trump. On his way out of the Washington area, Trump – who was not wearing a mask – again used the racist term “China virus” to describe the coronavirus, describing it in the past tense, and touted his administration’s work on developing a vaccine.\n\nHe thanked his staff and family and wished the next administration “great success” but did not mention his successor by name.\n\n“We love you, this has been an incredible four years,” Trump said in unscripted remarks at Joint Base Andrews shortly before leaving for Florida. “We’ve accomplished so much.”\n\n“I will always fight for you. I will be watching. I will be listening.”\n\nBiden’s task has been complicated by the fact that Trump impeded the transition between administrations. But Trump left the White House as a disgraced and diminished figure. CNN’s White House team has reported that although dozens of current and former officials had been invited to the Wednesday morning farewell ceremony, many declined to attend. Pence said his final goodbyes to Trump on Tuesday.\n\nIn a show of unity and Biden’s intent to work with leaders from both parties, his first public appearance Wednesday was at a church service at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in DC ahead of the inaugural ceremonies with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nAfter Biden was sworn in, he went to Arlington National Cemetery for a wreath-laying at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, joined by former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, along with their spouses.\n\nThe three former presidents recorded a free-flowing conversation at Arlington reflecting on the day’s events and how to restore unity in a deeply fractured country.\n\nObama reflected on the graciousness that Bush and his wife, Laura, showed him and Michelle Obama during their inauguration in 2008, and said it was a reminder that “we can have fierce disagreements, and yet recognize each other’s common humanity.”\n\nClinton noted that the nation is struggling through a most unusual time, “trying to come back to normalcy, deal with totally abnormal challenges, and do what we do best – which is try to make a more perfect union.”\n\n“I think the fact that three of us are standing here, talking about a peaceful transfer of power, speaks to the institutional integrity of our country,” Bush said.\n\nThe former President notably missing from the conversation was Trump, and yet it was his absence that allowed the restoration of civility after so much rancor.\n\n“I think if Americans would love their neighbor like they would like to be loved themselves, a lot of the division in our society would end,” Bush said.",

        "content": "North Carolina Republicans have introduced a sweeping elections bill that, among other steps, would bar election officials from encouraging or promoting voter turnout.\n\nIt’s the latest and starkest example of a trend among Republicans of opposing even nonpartisan outreach efforts that could boost voting rates.\n\nThe proposed ban “raises real questions about what democracy means in North Carolina, who really holds the power, who government is answering to,” Andrew Garber, a counsel in the Brennan Center’s Voting Rights and Elections Program, told Democracy Docket.\n\nRep. Allison Dahle, the top Democrat on North Carolina’s House Elections committee, was blunter.\n\n“I get the feeling that people don’t want democracy,” Dahle told Democracy Docket.\n\nDahle said she fears that if it isn’t stopped, the idea of a ban on promoting turnout could spread to other states.\n\n“I think North Carolina has become a testing ground,” Dahle said. “It’s become a place where [Republicans say], ‘let’s see if it works.’”\n\nIndeed, the ban is just the latest extreme anti-democracy tactic pioneered by North Carolina Republicans over the last decade or so. In 2016, a court found that the state’s voter suppression law targeted Black voters with “surgical precision.” They drew multiple gerrymandered maps, and stripped the Democratic governor of several powers before he took office. This year, they waged a months-long campaign, ultimately unsuccessful, to overturn a Supreme Court race by having over 65,000 valid votes thrown out after the vote-counting, and two recounts, had been completed.\n\nDahle represents Wake County, home to Raleigh, where hundreds of local Democrats rallied Thursday as part of a national “Good Trouble” day of protest in honor of the fifth anniversary of Rep. John Lewis’ death.\n\nTheir march to the state capitol focused on one message: Stop the elections bill.\n\nIn addition to the turnout provision, the measure, known as HB 958, would add new voting restrictions for military and overseas voters, and ban ranked choice voting. It also would empower Sam Hayes, the state election board’s new director and a former top aide to the Republican House leader, to replace state election board staff with political appointees.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after Republicans held a hearing to unveil the bill last month, Hayes suggested that he was responsible for much of it.\n\n“There are a number of things I’ve laid out that I would think that anybody, Democrat, Republican or independent or third party could get on board with,” Hayes said. “I have not made any drastic changes and what I’m looking to do is to make elections more efficient, more secure and most importantly, follow the law.”\n\nAfter Republicans gained control of the board in May, they appointed a new GOP majority that quickly ousted Karen Brinson Bell, a respected nonpartisan election administrator, and replaced her with Hayes, a Republican operative.\n\nOn Thursday, Hayes unveiled a separate plan to require over 100,000 registered voters to provide additional information that’s missing from their records, or risk being disenfranchised.\n\nIf the GOP-controlled legislature passes HB 958, Gov. Josh Stein (D) is expected to veto it. But House Republicans are just one vote shy of the three-fifths supermajority required to override a veto.\n\nIn North Carolina, elections are run at both the state and local level by five-person boards, rather than by individual election officials. The ban would bar members of the state board and county boards from making “written or oral statements intended for general distribution or dissemination to the public at large encouraging or promoting voter turnout in any election.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers argue that boosting turnout shouldn’t be a priority for election administrators.\n\n“The idea is that we want the state board to focus on the conduct of the election and that the responsibility for turnout is better handled by other folks,” Rep. Hugh Blackwell, the Elections committee chair and a sponsor of the bill, said when it was unveiled.\n\nBut he acknowledged: “We were trying to draw a line and we may not have gotten it just at the sweet spot,” and said changes could be made to the provision.\n\nBlackwell did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n“Voter turnout is a sign of a healthy democracy, and it should not be treated as a partisan matter,” Ann Webb, policy director of Common Cause North Carolina, said in a statement. “While the primary role of the boards of elections is to ensure orderly and accurate casting and counting of votes, encouraging turnout is a natural and nonpartisan aspect of that mission.”\n\nA resolution of the National Association of Secretaries of State, reauthorized in 2022, states that all members “are committed to encouraging voter registration and increasing access to elections.”\n\nGarber, with the Brennan Center, said the proposed ban likely infringes on constitutionally protected speech.\n\n“This looks like what’s known as viewpoint discrimination,” Garber said. “The bill theoretically would allow them to discourage voter turnout – but they can’t encourage voter turnout. That’s basically always unconstitutional under the First Amendment.”\n\nGarber compared the ban to a Texas law passed in 2021 that prohibited election officials from sending eligible voters an application for a mail ballot unless they requested it. After the Brennan Center sued, a court blocked the law as an infringement on free-speech rights. Though that injunction was later vacated on procedural grounds, the ruling that the provision violated the First Amendment was left unchallenged — suggesting that the North Carolina provision could be vulnerable to a similar challenge.\n\nThe ban also appears to conflict with the National Voter Registration Act. “The right of citizens of the United States to vote is a fundamental right,” the 1993 law says. “It is the duty of the Federal, State and local governments to promote the exercise of that right.”\n\nOf course, a ban on encouraging turnout is hardly the only recent Republican initiative that suggests a hostility to voting.\n\nSince 2020, several red states have passed laws similar to Texas’, blocking election officials from proactively sending out voter registration forms or applications for mail ballots.\n\nNorth Carolina was one of many states that banned election officials from accepting private funds to run elections, after an organization created by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg donated $400 million to election offices during the pandemic. Much of that money funded outreach efforts aimed at encouraging voting.\n\nAfter then-President Joe Biden issued an executive order in 2021 instructing federal agencies to promote voter registration, Republicans reacted by filing lawsuits and launching a congressional probe. Among the executive orders signed by President Donald Trump on his first day in office in January was one rescinding Biden’s order.\n\nPerhaps most revealingly, in 2023, a slew of GOP-controlled states left the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) — which experts call the country’s most effective system for sharing voter roll information between states. Several cited ERIC’s requirement that member states reach out to eligible but unregistered voters to try to get them on the rolls.\n\n“(ERIC) was a way to really identify who was not registered to vote,” Alabama Secretary of State Allen (R) said at the time. “And then, per the contract, the state would have to contact these voters and encourage them to get registered to vote.”\n\n“Our job is not to turn people out,” Allen added. “That is the job of the candidates — to make people excited to go to the polls. Our job is to make sure Alabama elections are the safest in the country.”\n\nIndeed, it’s common to find conservative thinkers and Republican politicians expressing qualms about the idea that everyone should vote — arguing that disengaged voters aren’t likely to make wise or well-informed decisions.\n\nIt’s a way of thinking that can have troubling implications.\n\n“People who aren’t informed about issues or platforms — especially when it is so easy to become informed these days — have no business voting,” Josh Divine, who was nominated this year for a federal judgeship by Trump, wrote in his college newspaper in 2010. “[W]hich is why I propose state-administered literacy tests.”",

Here's What To Know\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eric Thayer/Getty Images Eric Thayer/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 1:10p.m. ET\n\nThe inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States is going to look vastly different than those of his predecessors, given the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and heightened security concerns after a mob of pro-Trump extremists violently breached the U.S. Capitol two weeks ago.\n\nThere will be no throngs of people massed beneath a platform at the Capitol. Also absent will be President Trump, who's skipping town early.\n\nHere's what you can expect on Wednesday:\n\nWhat's the lineup of events?\n\nThe inaugural ceremonies will begin with the national anthem and invocation around 11:30 a.m. ET. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is expected to be sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor shortly before noon.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe president-elect will then be sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts at noon ET on the Capitol's West Front, as is tradition.\n\nIt is anticipated there will be roughly 1,000 guests in attendance, the majority of whom will be members of Congress and their guests.\n\nAfter he's sworn in, Biden will deliver his inaugural address (see more on that below).\n\nBiden will then move to the Capitol's East Front for what's known as Pass in Review, a longstanding tradition in which a new president assesses the military troops.\n\nAfter that, Biden, Harris and former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, along with their spouses, will then travel to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n\nBiden will then receive a military escort, with every branch of the military represented, from 15th Street to the White House before an evening of virtual activities.\n\nWhat can we expect from Biden's address?\n\nThe inaugural address gives a new president a chance to lay out an agenda and vision with all Americans (and the world) watching.\n\nSome of the best-known remarks from past presidents have been uttered during such an address, including former President John F. Kennedy's famous line: \"Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\"\n\nWhile the details of Biden's speech are being kept tightly under wraps, his inaugural team said the address will lay out his vision to \"defeat the pandemic, build back better, and unify and heal the nation.\"\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Biden talked at length about the campaign being a \"battle for the soul of America.\" It's likely he'll draw on that theme as he attempts to offer a message of healing to a nation bitterly divided by politics and in the midst of a pandemic that has cost the lives of nearly 400,000 Americans.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn recent days, Biden has detailed a huge legislative package to deal with the pandemic and its economic fallout, and outlined his plans to accelerate vaccinations. His team has also ticked through executive actions he plans to take after he's sworn in.\n\nTrump won't be there?\n\nNo. Trump, whom the House of Representatives impeached last week for inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol while lawmakers worked to certify Biden's election victory, is breaking with 150 years of tradition by not joining Biden at the event. It's customary for an outgoing president and other former presidents to sit behind a new president, symbolizing the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nBiden called Trump's decision not to attend \"one of the few things he and I have ever agreed on.\"\n\nTrump will leave the White House on Wednesday morning with a departure ceremony at Joint Base Andrews on his way to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nVice President Pence will attend the inauguration, however, as will three former presidents — Bush, Clinton and Obama.\n\nWhat's security like?\n\nJan. 20 comes two weeks to the day after the Capitol was breached and ransacked by a pro-Trump mob, and as such, the events will have the largest security presence of any inauguration in U.S. history.\n\nUp to 25,000 National Guard troops will be in place by Wednesday in response to security concerns. That's five times the number of U.S. service members currently stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe National Mall is closed to the public, and the area surrounding the Capitol has been blocked off. Vast stretches of downtown Washington, D.C., are barricaded and off-limits.\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser extended the city's public emergency following the Jan. 6 attack through Jan. 21, out of concerns there could be additional riots.\n\nThe FBI has also warned there could be violent protests in all 50 states ahead of Biden's inauguration. Statehouses have erected barricades and fencing, and some states have increased law enforcement and activated National Guard troops.\n\nDespite security concerns, Biden and Harris have remained determined to take the oath of office outside, on the West Front.\n\n\"I think we cannot yield to those who would try and make us afraid of who we are,\" Harris told NPR in an interview last week.\n\nHow else will Wednesday differ from past inaugurations?\n\nFor one thing, the size. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies would normally offer 200,000 tickets for the events at the Capitol, along with bundles of tickets for members of Congress to share with constituents.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut because of the coronavirus pandemic, no tickets are being offered to the public, and members of Congress are only able to have one guest join them. In fact, the Biden transition team has been urging supporters to stay home.\n\nInstead, the event will be livestreamed by the Presidential Inaugural Committee.\n\nFor another thing, the pageantry surrounding the inauguration will look a lot different this year, to accommodate public health and security concerns. In essence, the pomp has been stripped down, preserving the simpler elements of the transfer of power.\n\nSo ... does that mean no parade?\n\nThat's right, there won't be the traditional public parade from the Capitol to the White House this year.\n\nInstead, there will be a virtual parade called \"Parade Across America,\" which the Biden inaugural team says will feature \"diverse, dynamic performances in communities across the country\" and will pay \"homage to America's heroes on the front lines of the pandemic.\"\n\nDemocrats have had success recently in re-imagining traditional political moments as virtual events. During the summer convention, Democrats unveiled a highly produced nominating roll call that was widely praised for its creativity and inclusion.\n\nAnd no ball?\n\nYes, no inaugural balls this year. Instead, there will be a TV special Wednesday night hosted by film star Tom Hanks.\n\nThe 90-minute program is called \"Celebrating America\" and will feature musical acts and remarks from both Biden and Harris.\n\nWhat about musical guests?\n\nYes. Pop star Lady Gaga will sing the national anthem, and Jennifer Lopez, who started 2020 performing at the Super Bowl, will also perform a musical number.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, the Presidential Inaugural Committee announced that country star Garth Brooks will also perform on Wednesday.\n\n\"This is an honor for me,\" Brooks told reporters on a press call. \"This is not a political statement; this is a statement of unity.\"",

        "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden was sworn in on a 19th century family Bible on Wednesday, continuing his longtime tradition of using the heirloom during his decades of public service.\n\nThe five-inch thick Bible features a Celtic cross on the cover, and has been in the Biden family since 1893. The President has used the Bible each time he has taken an oath of office, including during his first Senate swearing-in in 1973 and his swearings-in as vice president in 2009 and 2013.\n\nSenator Joseph Biden takes the oath of office from the U.S. Senate's secretary, Frank Valeo with his father-in-law Robert Hunter and son Joseph Beau Biden at his side, in Beau's hospital room. Last month Beau and his brother Robert Hunter were injured in an auto accident that killed their mother Nealia and younger sister Amy. Senator Biden took the oath here with the permission of the Senate so that he could remain in Wilmington until both children were well. Beau is in traction while Hunter has recovered. Date created: January 06, 1973 Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nThe Bible was also used by Biden’s late son, Beau Biden, when he was sworn in as attorney general of Delaware in 2007.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden held the Bible on Wednesday as her husband took the oath of office, which was administered by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\n“Every important date is in there. For example, every time I’ve been sworn in for anything, the date has been on that, and it’s inscribed on the Bible,” Biden told Stephen Colbert in December.\n\n“Our son, when he was sworn in as attorney general, all the important dates in our family, going way back. And it’s just been a family heirloom,” he said.\n\nThe Bible has been so central to Biden’s political career that in 2009 when he took his final oath in the Senate, the swearing-in was delayed when the Bible couldn’t be located, according to the Wilmington News Journal.\n\nKamala Harris’ two Bibles\n\nWill Lanzoni/CNN\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, also used notable Bibles when she was sworn in on Wednesday. She chose two Bibles – one that belonged to former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, one of her heroes who inspired her to pursue a career in the law, and that of Regina Shelton, a neighbor who cared for Harris and her sister Maya when they were growing up.\n\nHarris and her sister attended church with Shelton, where the Vice President was introduced to the teachings of the Bible. Harris has described Shelton as a “second mother to us.”\n\nSecond Gentleman Douglas Emhoff held those two Bibles on Wednesday as Harris took her oath, which was administered by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.",

        "content": "Sunday’s World Cup final, which ended with Lionel Messi finally grasping the one trophy he had never won, was the most dramatic in tournament history. It was great theater, a bare-knuckle brawl that played out over 120 minutes and four rounds of penalty kicks before Argentina was declared the victor after a game that ended in a 3-3 draw.\n\nWhich raises one very vexing question: What to do for an encore?\n\nThe next World Cup kicks off in North America in 3½ years and will be the largest and most complex ever, with a record 48 teams playing 80 games in 16 cities spread across the United States, Canada and Mexico. It’s not so much a soccer tournament as it is a full-scale invasion.\n\nU.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone will be one of those trying to ensure it goes off without a hitch, and she will start that work by looking at what went right and what went wrong over the last month in Qatar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’m the type of person that I can learn from everyone. So I took that approach with Qatar, taking a look around and seeing how they’re doing it, comparing it to how I think things may work in the U.S.,” said Cone, who spent 2½ weeks in Qatar during the World Cup. “What could we do better? What things are they doing that we can maybe kind of adopt in the U.S.?\n\n“There were a lot of things that we can take notice of and hopefully make 2026 the biggest and best World Cup.”\n\nPreparations for the 2026 World Cup began before Messi set down the World Cup trophy after Sunday’s victory celebration. But it’s the differences more than the similarities that stand out when comparing the 2022 World Cup with the 2026 tournament. In Qatar, the 64 games were played in and around Doha, a city of 2.3 million people, and all eight stadiums were located within a 21-mile radius of the city center. In 2026, the tournament will be spread across four time zones with stadiums separated by as many as 3,500 miles, from the altitude of Mexico City and the humidity of Miami to cosmopolitan Toronto and homespun Kansas City, Mo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also different laws. Qatar strictly regulates the sale of alcohol, while the United States, Canada and Mexico pretty much encourage it. Qatar had to build seven of the eight stadiums and its Metro system from scratch and spent billions more to upgrade its international airport. All of the stadiums and much of the infrastructure for 2026 are already in place.\n\n“Not everything can transfer, right?” Cone said. “What works in one country may not work in another country.”\n\nThere’s also the tournament expansion. The last time the men’s World Cup was played in the United States, in 1994, there were just 24 teams. This time, the field will be double that size — so big that even FIFA President Gianni Infantino acknowledges he’s not sure how best to organize the tournament. Should it begin with 12 four-team groups or 16 three-team groups? Both scenarios have their pluses and minuses from a competitive standpoint, but Infantino quickly brought the conversation back to FIFA’s favorite subject: money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Three huge countries, 48 teams. More games, revenues will go up in terms of broadcasting, in terms of sponsorship, hospitality,” he said. “We will play in huge stadiums used for American football, [80,000] to 90,000 capacity. We are expecting 5.5 million fans traveling for these events.”\n\nWhich brings us to the most significant issue for both the three-country host committee and the 16 World Cup cities. FIFA has wrested control of much of the marketing and organization of the event away from its local partners, meaning FIFA will reap most of the profits while leaving the costs to local organizers. As a result, no World Cup will ever again produce the kind of domestic surplus the 1994 U.S. World Cup did, said Alan Rothenberg, a former U.S. Soccer president who organized that tournament, still the most successful in history.\n\n“Before, FIFA kept the TV rights and the international marketing rights and turned everything else over to us. We at least were able to get our share of local television and a handful of categories domestically for sponsorships. And then also participate in the ticket revenue,” Rothenberg said.\n\nAs a result, the 1994 tournament, still the best-attended World Cup ever, produced a surplus of about $50 million, more than double original projections. That funded the creation of the U.S. Soccer Foundation and helped grow the game at the grassroots level. Major League Soccer was also born in the wake of that tournament, with Rothenberg overseeing its creation.\n\n“It’s totally different from ‘94, that’s for sure,” said Rothenberg, now chairman of the sports marketing agency Playfly Premier Partnerships and an advisor to six 2026 host cities. “[FIFA] decided to bring things in house rather than just licensing third parties to do things. They’re running the show. The host cities are going to have the responsibility to operate the event and provide all the public services, and [FIFA is] providing very limited revenue opportunities for the host cities. So the host cities are scrambling to either find donations or public money or some creative ways to earn revenue.”\n\nThe new model will likely narrow the list of countries able to bid on future World Cups to wealthy nations such as the United States or authoritarian ones such as Russia, China and Saudi Arabia, Rothenberg said. But it also makes it harder for the tournament to produce the kind of impact and legacy the 1994 tournament did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Cone believes if this next World Cup comes and goes and nothing changes, it will be a costly missed opportunity, regardless of the financial constraints. The tournament should, at the very least, fuel interest in the sport and participation at the grassroots level.\n\n“There’s a lot to be done,” she said. “We’re looking at how can we use World Cup 2026 to grow participation, to grow our fandom. Not just in the host cities but in every city in every state. Because while I’m looking at the road to 2026, the tournament itself, my big focus is post-’26, when everyone packs their bags and goes home. What is the legacy of this World Cup and how are we changing the game? Have we made people reimagine our game and think about it in different ways?\n\n“Our job is to really think about it and strategize and work with our members, work with our stakeholders and our partners, to make sure that we are maximizing the impact of the World Cup in ‘26 and beyond.”\n\nIf they can pull that off, it would be quite an encore.",

        "content": "The moments that captured our attention at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Clive Brunskill/Getty Images Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nDOHA, Qatar — At the start of every World Cup tournament, the FIFA president usually says something like, \"this will be the best World Cup ever.\" True to form, FIFA's leader, Gianni Infantino, said exactly that during his pre-tournament briefing at the Qatar National Convention Centre last month.\n\nGiven all the uncertainty, protests and angst about holding this World Cup in Qatar, it seemed like a stretch.\n\nBut the competition on the field was stellar. From the surprises, shocks and upsets in the group stages to the excitement of the knockout rounds - and arguably the best final ever - this World Cup has excelled.\n\nArgentina's thrilling win over defending champion France in a penalty kick shootout gave star Lionel Messi the one trophy that he had not been able to capture during his lengthy career.\n\nThat was how the World Cup ended. But it's not how it began. For that, you have to go back a dozen years.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFrom start to finish, a World Cup of controversy\n\nControversies stuck to this World Cup from the moment, in 2010, when then-FIFA president Sepp Blatter opened an envelope and announced the voting result for the 2022 tournament.\n\n\"Qatar!\"\n\nMembers of the Qatari delegation hugged, but others immediately asked \"Qatar?\"\n\nThe U.S. government would later detail how Qatar won the bid through bribing members of FIFA, soccer's international governing body. Allegations Qatar denied.\n\nBut in 2010, those asking \"Qatar?\" had more practical concerns.\n\nSearing heat in the Persian Gulf nation during the World Cup's traditional summer slot. No facilities or infrastructure. A conservative, autocratic government.\n\nQatar and FIFA officials dealt with the first two concerns – a first-ever World Cup shift to November / December for a cooler tournament; a stunning, 12-year transformation costing a reported $300 billion turned Qatar and its largest city Doha into a World Cup ready destination.\n\nThe concern about a conservative autocracy \"welcoming\" more than a million visitors, many from liberal western countries, never was resolved and was a flashpoint for the controversies that created the biggest stir.\n\nOriginally, football fans would be able to buy beer at matches – a significant concession in a Muslim-majority country where alcohol is tightly controlled. But then, there was the 11th hour \"Bud ban.\"\n\nAt first, the message to the world was, everyone is welcome. Although not stated, the implication was that included members of LGBTQ communities, and the right to display rainbow colors as expressions of support for LGBTQ rights. But then, a sudden warning to European team captains that if they wore rainbow armbands, they'd be given a yellow card. The teams backed away from their planned show of support. Fans and journalists wearing rainbow-themed clothing either had it confiscated or were detained.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We didn't expect that,\" said Piara Powar, executive director of the Fare Network, an organization battling issues of discrimination in football. \"We were told by the Qatari's that people who waved rainbow flags openly on the streets of Doha, for example, would not be approached. The Qatari's didn't consider it an appropriate symbol of pride in their country, but they understood [the World Cup] is a global event and they had to respect that.\"\n\nBut Powar said, \"what we've seen is the direct opposite.\"\n\nHe believes there was a shift in perspectives of the government from on high.\n\nThe reversal raised questions about whether host country decisions trump those of FIFA, tasked with organizing the World Cup. FIFA, says Powar, had a more liberal stance on the rainbow colors issue, but Qatar prevailed.\n\nThe other major human rights controversy that preceded and ran through this event was the treatment of thousands of migrant workers who essentially built the World Cup.\n\nAbuses were well chronicled in the media, and to the very end of the tournament, rights groups called on FIFA and Qatari officials to provide compensation for the many workers who endured hardship, even death, due to their labor.\n\nThe officials noted recent labor reforms in Qatar, and insisted a framework already exists to help workers.\n\nBut in his closing new conference, FIFA president Gianni Infantino failed to commit to a compensation fund, when he was asked whether the governing body would share in its expected $7.5 billion in revenue from the tournament.\n\n\"We are defending human rights,\" Infantino said, without explaining how that statement squared with the controversies that stuck to what he called, the best World Cup ever.\n\nThe shocks and surprises\n\nThe biggest surprise of the tournament, arguably, came on the third day in group play. Saudi Arabia shocked Argentina 2-1 in one of the greatest World Cup upsets ever. Messi is one of the finest to ever play the game - but one trophy had eluded him: a World Cup title. (If you missed it, please listen to the NPR Podcast Last Cup which chronicles Messi's life to get to this point.) But the opening loss to Saudi Arabia ended up being just a speed bump. Argentina gelled to win the group, zip through the knockout rounds and win the final.\n\nAnother surprise came in the middle of the tournament - before a game. Portugal coach Fernando Santos shocked the sporting world when he didn't put star Cristiano Ronaldo in the starting lineup for the last two Portugal matches. The 37-year-old Ronaldo has dazzled on the pitch for decades - but wasn't his usual dominant self at this World Cup.\n\nThe United States makes this list too. After failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, the U.S. returned and did not lose a game in group play - and made it to the knockout round. But it would be another early exit with a round of 16 loss to the Netherlands.\n\nThe early exits (and, in some cases, very early exits) of traditional European powerhouses shocked many a soccer/football fan. Belgium didn't even make it out of group play. Portugal, Spain and Germany all bowed out ... and Italy didn't even make this tournament. The biggest surprise of this tournament, Morocco, is covered just below.\n\nWhile much has been written on Qatar's human rights record, prohibitions of stadium beer and questionable awarding of the World Cup, once the tournament began it operated smoothly. Transit around the small country was easy - not to mention having all eight stadiums within an hour of each other was a fan's dream. Past World Cups have required expensive plane trips between games.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe Atlas Lions roared\n\nMorocco's spirited and historic run to the semifinals will forever be part of this World Cup's story. As the first national team from an African and predominantly Arab nation to make it that far, the Atlas Lions inspired millions of fans beyond their North African country.\n\nAs Morocco stormed through the tournament, winning its group and then notching knockout stage wins over traditional European powers Spain and Portugal, fans in Qatar wrapped in all things red and green made the term \"cheering\" seem way too tame. They sang. They chanted. They whistled at the opposition – have you ever heard 50,000 people whistling? The ears still are ringing.\n\nAnd they roared. As their team on the pitch roared back, with its play.\n\nIn the end, Morocco's run, highlighted by a defense that didn't allow an opponent to score a single goal until the semifinals, ended against a stout and seasoned opponent – the defending champions from France.\n\nBut the run resonated in a major way.\n\nThere have been 88 semifinalists in the history of the men's World Cup — 85 have been from Europe and South America.\n\nMorocco, is only the third semifinalist not from those soccer-power continents.\n\nBut as Moroccan coach Walid Regragui said during the tournament, his team's breakthrough wasn't a miracle. It's the result of hard work.\n\nAnd planning.\n\nThirteen years ago, Morocco opened a national training center, the Mohammed VI Football Academy. It was a multi-million dollar investment that appears to have paid off in Qatar.\n\nAnd an indication that while what happened at this tournament didn't quite take down the sport's world order, it represented plates shifting underneath.\n\nMorocco, with this team and a growing pipeline, is positioned to prove Qatar wasn't a one off. And as the next World Cup explodes from 32 teams to 48, traditional soccer outsiders are bound to be inspired. And emboldened to think with planning and work and ok, maybe a little magic, getting inside isn't impossible.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Raul Arboleda/AFP via Getty Images Raul Arboleda/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFirst use of women referees\n\nThere's always grumbling about referees — calls they made or didn't — \"no way was that offside,\" to \"that wasn't a foul,\" and, of course, \"he just flopped.\" But at this World Cup referees made news for another reason. For the first time ever, women officials were used at the men's tournament. Six women - including Kathryn Nesbitt of the U.S. — officiated both on and off the field. And, an all-female crew, officiated the Germany/Costa Rica match.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe FIFA decision to use women referees happened in a country with restrictive women's rights.\n\nSaying goodbye\n\nIt may be the last World Cup we see Messi wearing an Argentina uniform or Ronaldo donning one for Portugal or Luka Modrić sporting the red and white checkerboard for Croatia. For decades they each have shined for their countries at many, many tournaments and given countless fans joy (and sometimes heartbreak).\n\nWe also say goodbye to the three journalists who died while covering this World Cup. American sportswriter Grant Wahl — perhaps the preeminent U.S. soccer reporter — collapsed during the Argentina-Netherlands quarterfinal. An autopsy determined he died of an aortic aneurysm (a burst blood vessel). ITV sports director Roger Pearce \"passed away suddenly\" last month and Qatari photojournalist with Al Kass TV, Khalid al-Misslam, \"died suddenly\" earlier this month.\n\n2026 and beyond\n\nThe stage is set for 2026 when the U.S. will co-host the next World Cup along with Mexico and Canada. As mentioned earlier, FIFA is expanding the number of teams from 32 to 48. It's not clear yet how the tournament will be organized or the format used to advance.\n\nOne thing is clear - it will be hard to top the 2022 tournament. But in four years, we bet FIFA will say that the 2026 World Cup will be the best ever.\n\nTom Goldman reported from Doha, Qatar and Russell Lewis reported from Birmingham, Ala.",

        "content": "With Lionel Messi still scoring for fun at Inter Miami and Cristiano Ronaldo signing a new bumper contract at Al Nassr, the never-ending debate over which player is better is still no closer to an answer.\n\nMessi's Inter Miami are in the mix to retain their Supporter's Shield given to the MLS side with the best regular-season record, and they take on New York Red Bulls this weekend. Messi has 16 goals and eight assists from 17 appearances so far this season, while he also shone at the Club World Cup recently.\n\nHis motivation shows no sign of slowing, which bring backs memories of a tale from a Barcelona training session in 2009, as former teammate recalled an incident involving an 'angry' Messi and his coach Pep Guardiola.\n\nLionel Messi enjoyed some of the best football of his career under Pep Guardiola at Barcelona. (Image: Getty)\n\nAdvert\n\nHenry played alongside Messi for three years after signing from Arsenal and remembers his amazement at Messi's attitude in training - including one time when the Argentine got angry with Pep Guardiola.\n\nIn quotes relayed through Rio Ferdinand's autobiography, Henry told the ex-Manchester United defender of a time when Messi was fouled in training but Guardiola did not award a free kick.\n\n\"So when the ball went back to his goalkeeper, he (Messi) ran back and demanded the ball,\" Henry said. \"The goalkeeper rolled him the ball, and Messi then proceeded to run through the entire team and score in anger.\"\n\nMessi and Ronaldo's rivalry has defined modern football. (Image: Getty)\n\nAdvert\n\nFerdinand added: \"Thierry said that was what he used to do in the playground at school. I did stuff like that too against little kids. But he (Messi) did it against some of the best in the world: Yaya Toure, Puyol, Iniesta, Xavi, Busquets. And it wasn't just that one time. He did it a couple of times.\"\n\n\"Thierry said: 'Can Ronaldo do that?' I said, 'Well, I've never seen him do that.' Thierry played with Zidane and Ronaldinho but they never did anything like that. He said: 'That's when I knew Messi was different to anyone we've ever seen'.\"",

        "content": "Marcus Rashford has already weighed in on the debate about Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as he prepares to complete his move to Barcelona.\n\nThe 27-year-old, who is a boyhood Manchester United fan, watched Ronaldo as a child before they were teammates during Ronaldo's ill-fated second stint at Old Trafford.\n\nBut Rashford only faced Messi twice, in both legs of the 2019 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals, which United were comfortably beaten 4-0 on aggregate.\n\nNow, with Rashford set to officially join Barcelona on a season-long loan this week, he will have the chance to cement his own legacy in Spain.\n\nAdvert\n\nDespite his connection to Ronaldo, Rashford revealed in an interview to CNN Sports back in 2018 that he believes Messi is the greatest player of all time - with his controversial viewpoint likely to anger some United fans.\n\n\"Some of the stuff that he [Messi] does is unbelievable,\" said Rashford.\n\nMarcus Rashford playing Lionel Messi (Image: Eric Alonso/MB Media / Contributor via Getty)\n\n\"I'm a big fan of Ronaldo as well, but I think Messi is the greatest ever.\"\n\nWhen will Marcus Rashford join his new teammates?\n\nRashford has completed his medical and is expected to be formally unveiled on Wednesday, ahead of Barcelona’s pre-season tour - which begins on Thursday.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt is a dream move for Rashford, who said in June that he would love the opportunity to play alongside Lamine Yamal.\n\nAt the time, the Catalans were focused on signing Athletic Club's Nico Williams, but the Spanish international decided to stay in Bilbao.\n\nBarcelona were also interested in Liverpool's Luis Diaz, but he was expected to cost too much for a club still struggling financially.\n\nInstead, Rashford presented an ideal option for Barcelona, who have signed him on a season-loan loan with a buy option of £30.3m.\n\nAdvert\n\nAlthough the England international is taking a wage cut, he will still be one of the best paid players in Europe.\n\nMarcus Rashford with Cristiano Ronaldo (Image: Michael Regan / Staff via Getty)\n\nWhere does Marcus Rashford fit in at Barcelona?\n\nAfter two difficult seasons in England, there is no guarantee that Rashford will start the season as a first-choice forward at Barcelona.\n\nAdvert\n\nBut he should provide healthy competition across the frontline, with the reigning Spanish champions set for another long season.\n\nRashford is most comfortable off the left, which is typically occupied by Raphinha, but the Brazilian is able to operate across the front three.\n\nYamal is still just 18 and Robert Lewandowski is nearly 37, so Hansi Flick will welcome the depth and versatility of Rashford.\n\nAnd in Flick, Rashford will be working under one of the world's best coaches.\n\nAdvert\n\nWith the 2026 World Cup in America looming, this is the biggest season of Rashford's career so far.",

        "content": "Lamine Yamal has named Barcelona and Real Madrid legends Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in a star-studded all-time XI.\n\nThe Barca starlet has been the talk of European football over the past year amid a meteoric rise in Catalonia, where he's broken several records at the age of 18. He played a key role in Hansi Flick's side's La Liga title win and was equally important for Spain in their Euro 2024 triumph last summer.\n\nThere are growing expectations that the Spanish attacker will continue to live up to the hype and become Messi's heir at Camp Nou. He never got the chance to play with the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner but he holds him in high regard.\n\nYamal made an appearance on China Media Group's \"Total Soccer\" program and was asked to come up with his greatest XI of all time. He went with Messi and Ronaldo in a scintillating attack. The longtime rivals aren't the only El Clasico heroes to make the team, although surprisingly there's no place for Xavi, Andres Iniesta or Sergio Busquets.\n\n##\n**Iker Casillas**\n\n###\n**Goalkeeper**\n\nThere have been some terrific goalkeepers to emerge on Spanish soil, and Iker Casillas is up there with the very best. The Real Madrid icon wasn't the most physically imposing shot-stopper, but he boasted tremendous athleticism to pull off constant world-class saves.\n\nCasillas is Madrid's second all-time appearance maker and he was crucial between the sticks for club and country. He came in clutch for Spain at Euro 2008, captaining La Roja and conceding just two goals en route to the nation's first trophy in 44 years.\n\n##\n**Dani Alves**\n\n###\n**Right-Back**\n\nThe Barcelona juggernaut that Pep Guardiola assembled was full of stars that worked in tiki-taka cohesion with one another; a case in point was Dani Alves, who supported Lionel Messi on the right flank with aplomb. The Brazilian was often seen bombing down the channel to offer support on the overlap.\n\nAlves was also a fine defender who could time a tackle to perfection and often made the right decision. He was sublime in Barca's 2010-11 season, registering 16 assists across competitions, particularly shining against Manchester United in a 3-1 Champions League final win.\n\n##\n**Gerard Pique & Sergio Ramos**\n\n###\n**Centre-Backs**\n\nWhen Gerard Piqué and Sergio Ramos met at club level, it often meant war amid the Spaniards' spells at Barcelona and Real Madrid. Both were vital for their respective teams and offered different profiles, which were utilised at international level.\n\nPique was calm and composed and was tidy on the ball alongside a reliable aerial presence with his six-foot-four-inch frame. He flourished alongside Carlos Puyol during Pep Guardiola's reign, having returned to Camp Nou from Manchester United in 2008.\n\nRamos is a menace who isn't afraid of putting his body on the line or doing his side's dirty work, with a red card always on the cards in El Clasico battles. His winning mentality was crucial for Madrid during their Champions League three-peat, which came after his heroic header led to a European title win over Atletico Madrid in 2014.\n\n##\n**Marcelo**\n\n###\n**Left-Back**\n\nCarlo Ancelotti wept at Marcelo's farewell ceremony in June 2022 after the left-back called time on his Real Madrid career. He jetted off to his homeland for a swansong but had already cemented his legacy as one of the best full-backs the game has ever seen.\n\nMarcelo brought Brazilian flair to the Santiago Bernabeu, displaying incredible agility and trickery on the left channel. He was a manager's dream thanks to his constant hard work and ability to help Los Blancos or Brazil in transition.\n\n##\n**Zinedine Zidane**\n\n###\n**Attacking Midfield**\n\nLamine Yamal preferred Real Madrid legend Zinedine Zidane over Barcelona's heroic midfield trio of Xavi, Andrés Iniesta, and Sergio Busquets. It speaks volumes about just how influential the Frenchman was in the sport, boasting astounding vision and creativity that sparked Los Blancos to life.\n\nZidane was often on cruise control, controlling proceedings in the middle of the park among fellow Galacticos such as Luis Figo, Ronaldo Nazario, David Beckham and Roberto Carlos. He loved nothing more than bagging a winner, such as his glorious volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 Champions League final.\n\n##\n**Ronaldinho**\n\n###\n**Right-Wing**\n\nIt's difficult to determine Lamine Yamal's formation because he appeared to adopt a five-man attack, placing Ronaldinho on the right. There was little chance he would omit the most entertaining player to wear Barcelona's red and blue.\n\nRonaldinho was a magnificent trickster who toyed with his opponents using his extensive skill set, including a famous dancing goal against Chelsea in 2005. His Selecao magic paved the way for the likes of Lionel Messi and Yamal to showcase their world-class skillset.\n\n##\n**Cristiano Ronaldo**\n\n###\n**Left-Wing **\n\nCristiano Ronaldo was selected on Lamine Yamal's left wing, but he'd likely be given the freedom to roam as he did during nine seasons at Real Madrid. He flourished during Los Blancos' Champions League dominance and broke several records, including becoming the competition's all-time top scorer with 140 goals.\n\nAt the start of his career, Ronaldo was spotted by Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United during a pre-season friendly and an Old Trafford move soon led to titles, goals and superstardom. He continues to prove that age is just a number at Al-Nassr while also still captaining his country at the age of 40.\n\n##\n**Neymar**\n\n###\n**Attacking Midfield**\n\nNeymar was another Brazilian who set Camp Nou alight during his four years alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez at Barcelona before making a controversial £200m move to Paris Saint-Germain in August 2017. The Parisians knew just how talented he was, which is why they opted to pay a world-record fee for the attacker.\n\nThe Santos star does stir up scrutiny both on and off the pitch, but when he's at his best, he's one of Brazil's outstanding players. He dribbles past players with ease while driving his team forward and leaving the opposition dumbfounded.\n\n##\n**Lionel Messi**\n\n###\n**Attacking Midfield**\n\nIt's quite easy to compare Lamine Yamal to Lionel Messi given their style of play and meteoric rise at Camp Nou. But the Spaniard doesn't like comparisons, much less, than with \"the best player in history\".\n\nMessi's 2022 World Cup crowning meant the Argentinian attacker had completed football, placing another trophy alongside eight Ballons d'Or. His audacious dribbling and unrivaled technical ability have long dominated world football and he continues to flourish at Inter Miami away from the European spotlight.\n\n##\n**Ronaldo Nazario**\n\n###\n**Striker**\n\nThere haven't been many number nines quite like Ronaldo Nazario who was unstoppable in his prime, bullying defenders and bagging goals for fun. He was the catalyst behind Brazil's 2002 World Cup win, claiming the Golden Boot with eight goals.\n\nRonaldo Nazario had pace, instinctive movement and a fierce shot that helped Real Madrid win La Liga twice. If it weren't fitness struggles he likely would have more trophies in his cabinet including a Champions League winners' medal that evaded him.\n\n**All statistics courtesy of ***Transfermarkt ***- correct as of 18.07.2025**",

        "content": "Marco van Basten was a truly elite player during his 17-year career as a professional. When you look at the numbers, it's hard to deny that he was one of the best strikers the world has seen.\n\nDuring his time with Ajax and then AC Milan, he was prolific, scoring an incredible 277 goals in 373 appearances at club level to win three Eredivisie titles, four Scudettos and two European Cups. Additionally, his 24 strikes for the Netherlands helped his nation claim the 1988 European Championships.\n\nScoring 300 career goals and accruing as much silverware as he did helped Van Basten claim three Ballon d'Or prizes. Having been crowned the best player in the world on three occasions, the forward knows what it takes to reach the top.\n\nBut when asked to name the three best players of all time, the Ajax icon decided to omit Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Both players are popular choices considering their legacies in modern-day football, but Van Basten insisted other players were more deserving of the honour.\n\n## Van Basten's Three Greatest Players Ever\n\n### Dutchman believed Messi lacked a certain quality\n\nWhen asked to name the three greatest players of all time in an interview with France Football (via the Mirror), Van Basten listed three players who all made a huge impact on football. Unsurprisingly, all three were attacking-minded players, with Johan Cruyff, Pele and Diego Maradona his preferred options.\n\n\"Pele, Maradona and Cruyff are for me the three great players in history. As a child, I wanted to be like Cruyff. He was my friend. I miss him. Pele and Maradona were also incredible.\"\n\nVan Basten said that his decision to snub Messi, who is regarded by many as the greatest footballer of all time for his record eight Ballon d'Or triumphs, was based on the fact that he lacked a quality that fellow Argentinian Maradona had plenty of - personality. In his eyes, the Napoli legend always wore his heart on his sleeve for the national side.\n\n\"Messi is also a magnificent player, but Maradona has always had more personality in a team. Messi is not the one who gets in front to go to war.\"\n\nVan Basten also paid tribute to Ronaldo along with two other greats of the game. He said: \"I don't forget Cristiano Ronaldo, [Michel] Platini or [Zinedine] Zidane.\"\n\n## Cruyff, Pele and Maradona's Legacy\n\n### The trio made a huge impact on the beautiful game\n\nWhile many supporters will immediately insist that Messi or Ronaldo deserve to replace one of the trio, all of Cruyff, Maradona and Pele undeniably deserve to be in the conversation of being the greatest player ever.\n\nCruyff was vital to the success of Ajax and Barcelona sides during the 1960s and 70s, playing a vital role in the development of Rinus Michels' 'Total Football' philosophy. Ranked as one of the most technically gifted players in football history, his ability in possession enabled teams to play free-flowing football, which allowed Ajax to claim three consecutive European Cups.\n\nPele, meanwhile, was a goalscoring machine, finding the back of the net 680 times in club matches. Also scoring 77 times for Brazil, he led the *Selecao *to three World Cup trophies, the only player to manage the feat. Nicknamed the King of Football, it is little surprise that Van Basten included him in the top three.\n\nLastly, Maradona was the man Argentina fans adored prior to Messi's dominance. Leading his nation to glory at the 1986 World Cup, a tournament in which he scored \"the goal of the century\" against England, the magician was nicknamed the \"Golden Boy\" after his incredible talent on the football pitch. Named FIFA Player of the Century for his achievements alongside Pele, there aren't many who exclude him from debates about the greatest to ever do it.",

        "content": "Lionel Messi had two goals and two assists to lead Inter Miami CF to a bounce-back 5-1 win over the host New York Red Bulls on Saturday night in Harrison, New Jersey.\n\nMessi and Inter Miami (12-4-5, 41 points) erased a 1-0 first-half deficit with a flurry of goals before the break -- two of them coming off the foot of Telasco Segovia -- that staked the Herons to a 3-1 lead ahead of the break.\n\nMiami won its sixth MLS match in its past seven after having a five-game winning streak snapped at Cincinnati on Wednesday. It was also the sixth time in the past seven games in which Messi has scored two goals.\n\n\"The reality is we had five games in the last two weeks, four of which were away. It is a complicated stage, especially because of the travel and the lack of rest between games,\" Miami coach Javier Mascherano said after the match. \"The game against Cincinnati was a reflection of the exhaustion the team carries, but now we have a long week. We will use it to give rest to those who are more tired, and with the expectation to recover a couple players that are injured and add them to the roster.\"\n\nThe Red Bulls (9-9-6, 33 points) failed to string together consecutive wins at home and lost to Inter Miami for the second time this season. Mascherano's team is in fifth place in the Eastern Conference, six points behind Philadelphia, but have three games in hand due to its participation in the Club World Cup this summer.\n\nNew York scored its lone goal in the 15th minute when Emil Forsberg lifted a corner kick in front of Miami goalkeeper Rocco Rios Novo's line of sight. Alexander Hack knocked it home for the score despite having defender Federico Redondo draped all over him.\n\nRios Novo made his second start this season for Oscar Ustari, who sat out with an injury.\n\nLionel Messi celebrates with teammates after a Miami goal against the New York Red Bulls. Getty Images\n\nJordi Alba, who exited the game in the 84th minute with what appeared to be a leg cramp, scored his first goal of the season in MLS league play off a cross from Messi in the 24th minute to tie the score 1-1.\n\nInter Miami took the lead for good in the 27th when Luis Suarez, who assisted on the first goal, sent a ball ahead to Messi, who then directed it quickly to Alba, who crossed it back to Segovia for an easy shot into the back of the net.\n\nIn the third minute of first-half stoppage time, Redondo advanced the ball into the Red Bulls' box but could not fire off a shot. Segovia, though, surged in and fired a shot off a rebound past Carlos Miguel Coronel for a third goal.\n\nMessi followed with goals in the 60th and 75th minutes to seal the outcome, to the delight of the scores of Miami supporters in the stands despite it being a road game.\n\n\"No, it's not a surprise [to see the madness that Messi causes] because I have been with him for eight years at Barca and 15 with Argentina,\" Mascherano said. \"Especially in places where he doesn't go with continuity people go crazy. I have seen it in airports, hotels, he generates this everywhere. I don't think it's only because of his football talent, but because of his admiration as an athlete and the way he's transcended football.\n\n\"Leo Messi, Michael Jordan, Rafa Nadal, these are people that have transcended the sport. We are very privileged the people that are close and can witness this.\"\n\nMessi increased his total goals in MLS games to 18 this season and has contributed on 27 scores. He has 40 goals in MLS since joining the league in the summer of 2023.\n\nThe Red Bulls mustered nine shots in the match, but they were outshot 8-1 in shots on target.\n\nInformation from Field Level Media was used in this report.",

It's a shirt with a complex history, but plenty of its owners have claimed the Ballon d'Or down the years, and Yamal will want to be next.\n\nAs he follows in the footsteps of some greats of the game, the winger has vowed to forge his own path, saying: \"I'm under no pressure; I'll continue enjoying myself with a different number.

Below, GOAL ranks the top 10 No.10s in Barcelona's storied history...",

One made it inside the bus, the other fell onto the pavement.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Victor Caivano/AP Victor Caivano/AP\n\nFootball association head Claudio Tapia blamed law enforcement for the changeup of plans. \"The same security organisms that were escorting us are not allowing us to move forward,\" Tapia wrote on social media. \"I apologize in the name of all the champion players.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nToward nightfall, when most of the fans had already poured out of downtown Buenos Aires, there were isolated clashes between a few stragglers and law enforcemen. At least eight people were injured, according to local media reports.\n\nThe incidents began when firefighters went to the Obelisk, the iconic Buenos Aires landmark that is the traditional site of celebrations, to evict a few people who had broken their way inside the monument.\n\nThe bus had been moving at a snail's pace for more than four hours through the throngs of humanity before the overland parade was cut short. Team Captain Lionel Messi and the rest of the players waved at the massive crowd as they carried the World Cup trophy aloft after securing the country's third title.\n\n\"This is madness, it's indescribable,\" said Brian Andreassi, 23, as he walked downtown wearing the team's jersey. \"There are no words.\"\n\nThe World Cup and the success of the Messi-led squad brought much-needed good news for a country stuck for years in economic doldrums and suffering one of the world's highest inflation rates, with nearly 4-in-10 people living in poverty.\n\n\"There's an immense union among all Argentines — unity, happiness. It's as if you can breathe another air, there's another energy in the air,\" said Victoria Roldán. \"My body and heart are about to burst.\"\n\nCarrying a World Cup replica, the 32-year-old and her 36-year-old sister, Mariana, were eager to catch a glimpse of the team and in particular its captain, Messi.\n\n\"We're dying to see him,\" Roldán said. \"Seeing him with that immense smile, with those bright eyes filled with hope, it really fills our heart with joy and happiness. ... I think that Leo has deserved it for years, and this was his moment.\"\n\nThe players were all smiles as they watched the multitudes hostling to get as close as possible to the bus. An estimated 4 million people were in the streets by Tuesday afternoon, according to local media citing police sources.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I celebrate the way the people took to the streets to honor our squad,\" President Alberto Fernández wrote on social media after the parade was cut short.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matilde Campodonico/AP Matilde Campodonico/AP\n\nCelebrating fans took over highways, avenues and the access routes into the capital as temperatures climbed to 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nThousands had set up camp since early Tuesday morning at the Obelisk.\n\nThe Argentine president declared a national holiday Tuesday so the country could celebrate the World Cup victory.\n\nThe song \"Muchachos,\" which was written by a fan and became a popular unofficial anthem for the Argentine team at the World Cup, filled the streets as fans joined in singing it over and over again.\n\nSome fans also paid tribute to Argentine soccer legend Diego Maradona, the captain of the 1986 squad that won the World Cup and who died two years ago, with flags bearing his name and face. \"This is for Diego, who's seeing it from heaven,\" fans chanted.\n\n\"This is a party. The last time Argentina was a champion I was 3 years old, I don't remember anything,\" said Yael Torchinsky, 39. \"I want to live this intensely because the Argentine people need this happiness.\"\n\nBy mid-afternoon, fans started filling up Plaza de Mayo in front of Government House, amid rumors the players might go there for a reprise of the festivities for Argentina's 1986 World Cup victory that were held there. Fernández's administration had offered the palatial mansion, popularly known as the Casa Rosada, or Pink House, according to Security Minister Aníbal Fernández.\n\nThe raucous welcome for the team began before dawn as thousands of fans lined up upon their return from Qatar.\n\nThe players were beaming as they descended from their plane in Ezeiza, outside Argentina's capital, shortly before 3 a.m. onto a red carpet. Messi was the first one out, carrying the World Cup trophy, flanked by coach Lionel Scaloni, who put his arm around the captain as they walked past a sign that read, \"Thank you, champions.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe team was welcomed by rock band La Mosca singing \"Muchachos,\" and several players, including Messi, could be seen singing the words as they boarded the bus taking them to the Argentine Football Association headquarters.\n\nIt took the bus an hour to travel the 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) from the airport to AFA headquarters, where the players were welcomed with fireworks, and then spent the night. In the morning, Messi posted a photo on social media showing him hugging the World Cup trophy next to him while he slept.",

        "content": "There has never been a greater rivalry in the world of sport, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo dominated football for several years and made LaLiga the most important football tournament for almost two decades\n\nAnd while Ronaldo often takes the media spotlight for his presence on social media and his commercial empire, Messi has not been left behind and his importance in the sporting world is indisputable.\n\nLionel Messi magic play with Inter Miami makes New Jersey stadium erupt\n\nCristiano can boast the record for the most goals scored in official matches, which shows how complete he is as a player Messi.\n\nDuring a recent MLS match between Inter Miami and the New York Red Bulls, Messi scored two goals to reach 764 official goals without penalties, surpassing Cristiano Ronaldo's 763.\n\nRemarkably, he did it in 167 fewer games, demonstrating a goalscoring efficiency that is hard to match.\n\nBut beyond the numbers, former players and experts have begun to point out what really sets Messi apart from other players.\n\nSteve Nicol reveals the secret behind Leo Messi's success\n\nThe former Scottish footballer praised Messi and revealed what the key element to his success is: \"His mentality, 100%\", says Steve Nicol\n\nDuring a talk on ESPN FC, former player and analyst Steve Nicol was clear in pointing out the main reason for Messi's sustained success: his absolute focus on football.\n\nMessi treats every game as if it were a Champions League final. His priority is the game. What he does on the pitch is what takes care of his family and his legacy Nicol\n\nCompared to other stars who came to MLS with the intention of relaxing, such as Pirlo, Gerrard or even Ibrahimovic, Messi came with the intention of competing. \"He didn't come on vacation,\" said presenter Kay Murray. It is this professional and competitive attitude that has made the difference, even in a league that many continue to underestimate.\n\nMessi, the best MLS ambassador\n\nMessi's arrival at Inter Miami in 2023 was a turning point for Major League Soccer. After winning the World Cup with Argentina, the star had more lucrative, or more attractive from a footballing point of view, offers in Saudi Arabia or returning to Barcelona. However, he chose the United States, a completely surprising decision, as Inter Miami was a very modest team at the time.\n\nThe Messi effect in MLS\n\nSince his debut, the effects were immediate: sold-out tickets, record-breaking shirt sales and an explosion of interest in the league. In 2023, 2024 and 2025, he led global football shirt sales, even with special editions such as the \"Miami Vice\" model.\n\nIn addition, his influence has extended to teammates such as Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, and young stars such as Benjamin Cremaschi, who now play under the international spotlight.\n\nAnd as the United States prepares to co-host the 2026 World Cup, Messi's impact continues to grow. His presence has transformed the perception of MLS, attracting new fans, investors and future talent.\n\nWhat David Beckham started in 2007, Messi has taken to another level and soccer in North America is increasingly enjoying a better reputation and largely thanks to the Argentine No.10.",

        "content": "Finally. Lionel Messi leads Argentina over France to win a World Cup championship.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Catherine Ivill/Getty Images Catherine Ivill/Getty Images\n\nAL DAAYEN, Qatar — The 2022 World Cup started terribly for Argentina. The shocking opening loss to Saudi Arabia - and the whispers began immediately.\n\nIs this it?\n\nWill Lionel Messi end his glorious career without winning a World Cup?\n\nThe statistics were clear. Losing the first game in group play makes it almost impossible to advance to the knockout round. Not only would Argentina advance, it won the group and kept winning and never stopped.\n\nNow, with a 3-3 (4-2 penalty kick shootout) victory over defending champion France, Lionel Messi can call himself a World Cup champion in what was probably his final World Cup match. It's Argentina's third title and those early whispers have been replaced by tears and cheers.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nArgentina started the match against France with aggressiveness and relentless attacks. The French, who looked so dominant all tournament, struggled to find their rhythm, cohesion and energy it had showcased in Qatar.\n\nThe Argentina attack paid off midway through the first half. Argentina forward Ángel Di María scooted past France's Ousmane Dembélé who tripped him in the box and won a penalty kick.\n\nThere was no doubt who would take it. Lionel Messi, playing in his 26th World Cup game (the most ever in the men's tournament), walked up to the penalty spot, 12 yards from the French keeper. With a deep breath and calm strike, he powered it low and to the right. 1-0.\n\nWith the goal, Messi became the first man to score in every game of a World Cup knockout round in a single tournament (round of 16, quarterfinal, semifinal and final).\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe South Americans were not done. In the 36th minute, Argentina managed to dissect the French defense across midfield. With just two crisp passes, it was Di María creating the chances, again, streaking into the box with a shot lifted above diving French keeper Hugo Lloris. 2-0.\n\nAfter the goal, Di María trotted back to the Argentina side of the field, wiping away tears.\n\nFrance looked out of sorts. Coach Didier Deschamps did the unthinkable - replaced two of his starters in the first half: Dembélé (whose foul led to the first goal) and all-time French scoring leader Olivier Giroud.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAt halftime, defending-champion France looked shocked. The French star, Kylian Mbappé, had little to show in the first 45-minutes of the match.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Franck Fife/AFP via Getty Images Franck Fife/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMbappé shined during the 2018 World Cup as a 19-year-old. The comparisons were many to another teenager with a stellar soccer pedigree: Pelé. (In 2018, Mbappé became the first teenager to score at a World Cup final since Pelé in 1958). At the 2022 tournament, Mbappé picked up where he left off.\n\nHe set another World Cup record — surpassing Pelé's record for a player under 24 with his 12 total goals. Mbappé scored eight goals in Qatar - entering the final tied with Messi with the overall goal lead. But against Argentina, Mbappé had been largely silenced. Which is saying something. His first recorded shot came in the 71st minute.\n\nThe nearly 89,000 people inside Lusail Stadium were overwhelmingly for Argentina - most wearing the team's trademark white and sky blue uniform. It was electric. They cheered every touch, every pass and every shot.\n\nBut in the 80th minute, Mbappé sliced the Argentina lead in half with a penalty shot to make it 2-1. All match long, France had been muted. Quiet. Unsure. But then the game's energy changed as France showed some life.\n\nThen, 93 seconds later, unbelievably Mbappé did it again. He evened the score with a blistering right-footed shot beyond the Argentinian keeper Emiliano Martínez. 2-2.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Catherine Ivill/Getty Images Catherine Ivill/Getty Images\n\nThis is the French team everyone expected to see in the championship. It was finally Messi vs. Mbappé. The 35-year-old, one of the finest to ever play the game, against the 23-year-old, who continues to add to his impressive soccer pedigree.\n\nThe teams played nine more minutes in regulation - and eight more in stoppage time. Neither would score - forcing 30-minutes of extra time.\n\nArgentina had been here before. It lost in the 2014 World Cup final when Germany scored in extra time and won 1-0.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThis time it would be Argentina which scored in extra time. And was there ever any doubt who would knock it in? Lionel Messi, of course. The ball ricocheting in front of the French goal and Messi booting it in. In the 109th minute. His second goal of the evening. 3-2.\n\nOf course that score wouldn't hold. A handling call inside the Argentine box led to another penalty kick attempt for France. And of course it would be Mbappé. And of course he scored in the 118th minute. A hat trick for the young French star. 3-3.\n\nBoth sides battled in the waning minutes. But it would come down to a penalty kick shootout to end what will likely go down as the best World Cup final in history.\n\nArgentina got the early advantage. After penalty kicks scored by Mbappé and Messi, the Argentina keeper stopped the attempt by France's Kingsley Coman. Then, Aurélien Tchouaméni missed his attempt. It came down to Argentina's Gonzalo Montiel who scored the winning penalty kick. Tears and hugs and smiles for Messi and all of Argentina, really.\n\nIt had not been since 1986 when Argentina last won a World Cup carried by Diego Maradona - the man whose shadow has loomed large over Messi.\n\nThe 2022 World Cup belongs to Argentina. It's Argentina's third title and the first for Lionel Messi. The first time he can call himself a World Cup champion. It was his last chance. Now his resume is full.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Julian Finney/Getty Images Julian Finney/Getty Images\n\nTom Goldman contributed reporting from Al Daayen, Qatar, and Russell Lewis reported from Birmingham, Ala.",

        "content": "Javier Mascherano says Lionel Messi is \"someone who transcends the sport\" after he inspired Inter Miami to another big victory.\n\nMessi scored twice and grabbed an assist for Jordi Alba as Miami came from behind to record a 5-1 win over the New York Red Bulls on Saturday.\n\nIt was the Argentinian's sixth brace in seven games, while it took his total to 18 goals for the season, the joint-most in MLS (also Sam Surridge).\n\nMessi also had the most expected goals (xG) of anyone on the pitch with 1.8, as well as the most shots (five), the most touches in the opposition box (11), the most final-third entries (nine) and the most chances created (four).\n\nAnd Mascherano compared his former team-mate to greats from other sports after the warm reception he received in New Jersey.\n\n\"I was with him for eight years at Barcelona, with the national team, at airports, hotels - especially in places he hasn't visited often, people go crazy,\" Mascherano explained.\n\n\"He generates all of this. I think the admiration is total, but it's not just because of the kind of footballer he is. I think he's a role model, someone who transcends the sport.\n\n\"Any sports fan feels admiration for athletes like Messi, Michael Jordan, Rafael Nadal – people who have made history in their sport. We are very privileged to witness this up close.\"\n\nMiami got back to winning ways on Saturday, after a 3-0 loss to FC Cincinnati had ended a three-game winning streak.\n\nThe Herons are fifth in the Eastern Conference on 41 points, seven behind leaders Cincinnati, though Miami do have three games in hand on the teams above them due to their Club World Cup participation.\n\nMascherano highlighted that Miami need to improve defensively ahead of a busy end to the season, with MLS also being paused for the Leagues Cup from the end of this month.\n\nMiami have not kept a clean sheet since a 1-0 win over Columbus Crew on April 19, going 13 matches without a shutout since then.\n\n\"This was a difficult period with all the travel and little rest – the match against Cincinnati reflected our fatigue,\" he added.\n\n\"Now we have a long week, and we'll use it to let the guys who are the most tired get some rest.\n\n\"If you want to be competitive, you have to be very solid defensively. We've been okay, but we need to improve.\"",

        "content": "Argentina has won the 2022 FIFA World Cup!\n\nIn a thrilling match that went to extra time and then a shootout between Argentina and the former reigning champion France, Lionel Messi scored two goals to help secure the win for Argentina.\n\nThe final score was 3-3 decided in a shootout, which ended 4-2.\n\nFrance's star player Kylian Mbappe scored three times, twice in regulation to tie the game and again to tie the game in extra time.\n\nODD ANDERSEN/AFP via Getty\n\nThis is Messi's first World Cup win and Argentina's third. They previously won the FIFA tournament in 1978 and 1986. Before that, Argentina had been runners-up thrice, in 1930, 1990, and 2014.\n\nFrance had previously taken home the title in 2018, defeating Croatia 4-2 in the final round.\n\nMatthew Ashton - AMA/Getty\n\nThe 2022 World Cup set historical records since its' start on Nov. 20 in Doha, Qatar. The 22nd edition of the tournament was the first to be played in the Middle East. Because of the location's intense summer heat, the 2022 World Cup was the first not to be held in May, June, or July.\n\nAdditionally, it was played in a reduced timeframe of 29 days (whereas it typically runs just over a month).\n\nDuring the tournament's semi-final round, Morocco made history when they defeated Portugal 1-0, marking the first African team to advance to the World Cup semifinals.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Yassine \"Bono\" Bounou, the Morocco goalkeeper, reflected on the win after the game at the Al Thumama Stadium.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"Pinch me, I think I'm dreaming,\" he said, per the outlet. \"These moments are great, but we're here to change the mentality. With this feeling of inferiority, we have to get rid of it. The Moroccan player can face any in the world. The generation coming after us will know we can create miracles.\"",

François-Xavier Mart/AFP/Getty Images A view inside Al Bayt Stadium during the opening ceremony. Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters The best photos of the 2022 World Cup Prev Next\n\nThe clashing of two stars\n\nThis match had been billed as Kylian Mbappé vs. Messi – the 23-year-old French star ready to assume the mantle of the world’s greatest player from his 35-year-old Paris Saint-Germain teammate.\n\nMbappé was defending France’s 2018 win at the tournament in Russia, Messi was playing in his final World Cup match, looking to claim the trophy which has eluded him for so long and which would enable him to match Diego Maradona’s achievement of winning the 1986 competition.\n\nThe opening 79 minutes was all about Messi. Argentina’s captain converted the penalty to give Argentina the lead. Next, his deft touch was key in springing the move which led to La Albiceleste’s second.\n\nThen in the closing stages of normal time, Mbappé single-handedly took a grip of the game, scoring two goals in two minutes and sending the final to extra time.\n\nMessi looked shot and Mbappé looked like he was just getting going.\n\nExcept it was the diminutive Argentine who next popped up to score his second goal of the match and restore his team’s lead in the 109th minute.\n\nRefusing to accept defeat, Mbappé roused his teammates, scoring a second penalty to grab his hat-trick and take the final to a penalty shootout.\n\nBoth Mbappé and Messi scored in the shootout but in the end – with France missing two penalties – it was the Argentina captain who was mobbed by his teammates as his World Cup dream was lived out in real time.\n\nOver two hours of soccer, these was two players – at two different points of their careers – demonstrating the beautiful game in vivid, glorious technicolor.\n\nMbappé sits on the bench at the end of the World Cup final. Manu Fernandez/AP\n\nFrom the spot\n\nThe last time a World Cup final went to penalties was in 2006 when France was once again beaten, this time by Italy.\n\nSometimes, it feels unfair to settle a game in a shootout, a series of actions between the penalty taker and the goalkeeper.\n\nHowever, at the Lusail Stadium on Sunday, the abundance of penalties seemed to ratchet up the pressure and tension.\n\nMessi’s penalty in the first half gave him his first World Cup final goal, while his spot kick in the shootout was coolness personified.\n\nMbappé’s ability to not once, not twice, but three times successfully convert from the spot in one game showed extreme gumption.\n\nMbappé scores France's third goal against Argentina in the World Cup final. Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nPreviously at Qatar 2022, one team had already experienced the intensity of that pressure cooker atmosphere and emerged the other side, and one which had not.\n\nArgentina got the better of the Netherlands in the quarterfinals in an epic which culminated in a penalty shootout, and one which saw the South American team display distraction and delaying tactics to arguably mentally monster their opponents.\n\nIn Sunday’s final, Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez showing his ability to distract the French takers, throwing the ball away before Aurélien Tchouaméni attempt, which flew wide. France’s previous attempt – from Kingsley Coman – had been saved by Martinez.\n\nA penalty shootout is arguably unlike anything else in sports – it’s a modern day duel and a World Cup final with so much at stake only heightens the tension and drama.\n\nMartínez saves the penalty from Kingsley Coman of France in the World Cup final. Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images\n\nGreat goals\n\nWorld Cup finals are often tight and cagey affairs, with goals at a premium.\n\nArgentina and France threw away that playbook – delivering six goals, two of which were of the highest quality.\n\nArgentina’s second was arguably as good as Carlos Alberto’s breathtaking goal in the 1970 World Cup final in Brazil’s 4-1 win over Italy.\n\nIt was in the 35th minute, when a flick round the corner from Alexis Mac Allister to Messi, relieved some pressure on the Argentina defense as France pushed for an equalizer.\n\nAfter Messi’s deft touch to Julián Álvarez and the Manchester City forward’s excellently weighted pass to Mac Allister, who had continued his run, Argentina was in on goal.\n\nUnselfishly, Mac Allister had the presence of mind to square the ball to Ángel Di María who finished off a brilliant sweeping counterattack to put Argentina 2-0 up.\n\nDi María celebrates after he scored Argentina's second goal against France in the World Cup final. Stefan Matzke/sampics/Corbis Sport/Getty Images\n\nAt that point, it looked to be the crowning moment of a dominant Argentina victory, until Mbappé stepped up.\n\nAfter his penalty reduced the deficit to 2-1, a neat one-two with Marcus Thuram had the ball falling to the PSG star out of the sky on the edge of Argentina’s penalty area.\n\nWith seemingly all the time in the world, Mbappé produced a wonderful display of technique and timing to thunder the ball past a despairing Martínez.\n\nThese are the moments that capture imaginations and the moments that came to define the 2022 World Cup final.\n\nIt will be remembered for so many reasons – Messi’s moment of history, Mbappé’s hat-trick in defeat, the seesaw nature of the game that oscillated from end to end and never ceased to tug on gobsmacked watchers’ emotions.\n\nOther great World Cup finals\n\nOf course, there’s plenty of competition for the title of ‘greatest World Cup final.’\n\nIn 1950, Uruguay upset Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, while four years later, West Germany provided another huge surprise, beating Hungary’s Magical Magyars, earning the country its first World Cup title.\n\nGeoff Hurst scored the first World Cup final hat-trick in the 1966 final between England and West Germany. Hurst’s second goal is still talked about 56 years later – had the ball crossed the line? It did, according to the game’s officials and England won 4-2.\n\nThe 1970 final marked Pelé’s last World Cup appearance as he secured his third title in Brazil’s swashbuckling victory over Italy.\n\nFour years later in Munich, host West Germany came from behind to win 2-1 against a star-studded Netherlands team – made up of Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens – to win its second World Cup.\n\nMuch like Messi at Qatar 2022, Diego Maradona almost single-handedly drove his team to its second title in eight years, beating West Germany 3-2 in the final.\n\nIn 1998, France hosted and won its first World Cup, mainly down to the genius of Zinedine Zidane, who scored twice in the final, to beat a formidable Brazil side, composed of Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Cafu, Bebeto and Roberto Carlos.\n\nHowever, with its multiples story lines and the drama and artistry on display, surely the 2022 showpiece now owns the title of ‘greatest World Cup final.’",

        "content": "A World Cup that opened with a beer ban ended with a champagne toast. A tournament that started with a call for cultural sensitivity finished with a cultural icon being celebrated.\n\nThe first World Cup held in the Middle East and the first played in a majority-Muslim country will someday be remembered for many things, but for now there’s no reason to look past Sunday’s epic final, which ended with Lionel Messi finally lifting the 14-inch solid gold World Cup trophy as fireworks exploded from the roof of a sold-out 89,000-seat stadium, lighting up the night sky.\n\nIt was the only prize Messi, widely considered the greatest player in soccer history, had never won. And when he came face to face with it for the first time after Argentina’s penalty-kick win over France, he paused to give it a gentle kiss.\n\nIn football-mad Argentina the late Diego Maradona, who led Argentina to its last world championship in 1986, is so revered, there was a religion — La Iglesia Maradoniana or the Church of Maradona — dedicated to him. In Messi’s hometown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMessi, meanwhile, can’t even claim a pew. But that might soon change after tens of thousands of people poured into the streets of Buenos Aires to celebrate Sunday’s title.\n\nMessi’s title.\n\nArgentina’s captain scored seven goals in the tournament; six of them gave Argentina a lead. His two goals Sunday also made him the first player in history to score in all five rounds of a World Cup: the group stage, the round of 16, the quarterfinals, semifinals and final.\n\nAnd when it was over, Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, global soccer’s governing body, handed the World Cup trophy to Messi, who might have done more than any other player in history to earn it.\n\n“We’ve done it,” said Messi, whose postgame celebration was a mix of smiles and tears. “We couldn’t have asked for more. What can I say? We were destined to become world champions and now we are.”\n\nLionel Messi kisses the World Cup trophy after Argentina’s victory over France in the Qatar World Cup final. (Martin Meissner / Associated Press)\n\nNo one has played more World Cup games than Messi, a seven-time world player of the year, and only Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal has scored more goals for club and country. Messi has won league titles in France and Spain and played more games and scored more goals than anyone in Argentine history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut at home, where soccer is more a passion than a sport, the national team is everything. And all Messi had brought it was an Olympic gold medal in 2008 and a Copa América title last year. Now he has as many World Cups as Maradona.\n\n“It’s just a football game. Life goes on. Your problems will still be there,” Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said. “But maybe this will make people just a little bit happier. We managed to lift this trophy. Something we’ve been dreaming about for so long.”\n\nBut if the World Cup ended in a dream, it started as anything but. Two days before the opening game of a tournament Qatar had waited 12 years to stage, the government told FIFA it wouldn’t honor an agreement to let Budweiser, a major World Cup sponsor, sell beer at the tournament’s eight stadiums. With FIFA’s help, the country also banned rainbow-colored clothing and other LGBTQ-friendly symbols from tournament venues.\n\nThe hard line came in response to public concerns that the 1.2 million visitors expected to flood Qatar for the monthlong tournament would not respect the culture and laws of a country where alcohol sales are heavily restricted and same-sex relationships are prohibited.\n\nGermany’s players reacted by wearing rainbow colors on their boots and covering their mouths with their hands during a team photo, claiming FIFA was censoring them. Iran’s team also went silent, refusing to sing the country’s national anthem in a show of support for women’s rights protesters at home. It fell to Morocco, which hadn’t won a World Cup game this century, to bring the focus for many back to soccer.\n\nGermany’s soccer team players cover their mouths in show of protest before a World Cup group match against Japan on Nov. 23. (Ricardo Mazalan / Associated Press)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the first Arab World Cup, Morocco united the Arab world by rolling into the semifinals unbeaten. It knocked Belgium, the second-ranked team in the world, and Spain, the 2010 champions, out of the tournament, then sent Ronaldo and Portugal home with a win in the quarterfinals. Morocco didn’t allow an opposing player to score in five games, becoming the first Arab country and first African country to reach the World Cup’s final four.\n\n“We realize that we made a great achievement. We saw the pictures and we saw that everyone was proud of us in our country,” said Walid Regragui, the team’s French-born coach. “I think the world as a whole is proud of this Moroccan team because we show great desire.”\n\nSpeaking of great desire, Qatar’s wish for this World Cup was to showcase itself to the world. But while 12 years of planning and more than $220 billion in infrastructure spending bought seven new stadiums, world-class museums and a state-of-the-art public transportation system, it couldn’t hide the country’s horrific treatment of migrant workers, which drew scorn from human rights groups around the globe.\n\nThat spotlight grew brighter early in the World Cup when the secretary general of Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, which helped organize the tournament, admitted there had been “400 to 500” migrant-workerdeaths related to World Cup construction, dozens of times the number the government had previously claimed.\n\nPakistani migrant laborers pose in front of the skyline of Doha. Migrant laborers who built Qatar’s World Cup stadiums often worked long hours under harsh conditions and were subject to a number of abuses, according to human rights groups. (Nariman El-Mofty / Associated Press)\n\nThe human rights issues, the free speech questions and the sidelining of a major corporate sponsor probably won’t help Qatar in its bid to host the 2036 Olympics. If Infantino wasn’t already bald, he certainly would have been tearing his hair out after a month of dealing with the Qataris’ ever-changing whims. Why would the International Olympic Committee voluntarily put itself in the same position?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich is why Sunday’s game, played on National Day, the commemoration of Qatar’s unification and the country’s most important secular holiday, was so important. It wasn’t the greatest final ever played; France’s poor play for most of the first 80 minutes disqualifies the match from that conversation. But as pure theater, it might have been the best ever, the drama likely unmatched.\n\nArgentina took a 2-0 lead into the final 10 minutes only to have France’s Kylian Mbappe score two quick goals to tie the score. Messi untied it in the second extra-time period, only to have Mbappe tie it again, this time with two minutes left, sending the game into a penalty-kick shootout that Argentina won — with Messi contributing the first goal.\n\nSoccer ⚽ Complete coverage: 2022 Qatar World Cup For the first time, the FIFA World Cup is heading to the Middle East for a fall showcase. Here is The Times’ complete coverage of the 2022 Qatar World Cup.\n\nAfterward, Mbappe was consoled by his country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, while Messi was congratulated by an emir, with Qatar’s leader giving him a Bisht, a black and gold robe, and a backslap. All he really wanted was the World Cup trophy, which he gripped tightly as his teammates carried him off the field after what he said was his last World Cup match.\n\nScaloni, the coach, was asked afterward if Messi, who will be 39 when the next World Cup final is played in the U.S., might reconsider his retirement.\n\n“If he wants to keep playing,” Scaloni said, “he’ll be with us.”",

Europe's ever-hotter and increasingly common blistering summer heatwaves are a direct result of that warming, they argue.\n\nIn Italy, 17 cities -- from Milan in the north to Palermo in the south -- were put on red alert for high temperature, with peaks recorded of 39 degrees Celsius (12 Fahrenheit).\n\nIn Rome, the high temperatures drove the Eternal City's many tourists and pilgrims towards its 2,500 public fountains for refreshment.\n\nAnd in Venice, visitors to -- and protesters against -- Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos's Friday wedding in Venice sweltered in the extreme heat.\n\n\"There is no wind, a lot of humidity, we are sweating, and I'm suffocating at night,\" Alejandra Echeverria, a 40-year-old Mexican tourist to the city, told AFP on Saturday.\n\nA man in Venice uses an umbrella to protect himself from the heat. © Marco Bertorello, AFP\n\nSunday forecast hotter\n\nIn France, as temperatures in the southern port city of Marseille flirted with 40C, the city's authorities ordered public swimming pools be free of charge to help residents beat the Mediterranean heat.\n\nTwo-thirds of Portugal will be on high alert on Sunday for extreme heat and forest fires, with 42C (108F) expected in the capital Lisbon.\n\nThe heatwave is forecast to become even more intense on Sunday.\n\nSpain, which has in past years seen a series of deadly summer blazes, is expecting peak temperatures in excess of 40C (104F) across most of the country.\n\nAccording to AEMET, Spain's meteorological agency, El Granado in the southwest Huelva region recorded 46 Celsius (114F), which if confirmed would be the hottest temperature ever recorded in Spain during June.\n\nThe past three years have been the hottest in Spain's history.\n\nTourists by the Bridge of Sighs in Venice walking in the heat. © Marco Bertorello, AFP\n\nPrecautionary measures\n\nWith peaks of 39C (102F) expected in Palermo, Sicily has ordered a ban on outdoor work in the hottest hours of the day, as has the Liguria region in northern Italy.\n\nThe country's trade unions are campaigning to extend the measure to other parts of the country.\n\nAnd in France, where heatwave alerts were extended Saturday across the country, the central city of Tours ordered schools there closed on Monday and Tuesday in the afternoon.\n\nThe nearby city of Orleans had already made access to some air-conditioned museums free and announced it was keeping parks and gardens open late.\n\nIn the French Mediterranean city of Nice, where the mercury hit 33 Celsius at midday (91F), residents and tourists were seeking refuge in misted parks and museums.\n\n\"We're not going to stay cooped up all day,\" said one retiree resting in the shaded Promenade du Paillon, a central greenway.\n\nWatch moreClimate change and Europe's ‘suffocatingly’ hot heatwaves\n\nFamilies with young children flocked to water jets and cooling sprays.\n\n\"We live in a city-centre flat without a pool, and the sea is tricky with a two-year-old,\" said Florence Oleari, a 35-year-old GP.\n\nAt the Albert I garden, organisers of a triathlon to be held on Sunday briefed 4,000 competitors on emergency measures, including ice stations and electrolyte stations.\n\n\"If I feel unwell, I'll stop,\" said Frederic Devroye, a participant who travelled from Brussels for the triathlon, which includes a 3.8 km swim, a 180 km cycle with 2,600 m of elevation, and -- to top it off -- a marathon. Local authorities have distributed nearly 250 fans to schools over the past fortnight, while tourists like Jean-Luc Idczak opted to explore Nice's air-conditioned museums to keep cool.\n\n\"With this weather, it's perfect,\" he said as he entered the city's photography museum.\n\nIn Seville, where forecasts suggested temperatures could reach up to 43 degrees Celcius, locals and tourists used handheld fans and caps to shield themselves from heat.\n\n\"Lots of cream, sun protection, on the face, everywhere, and very light clothing,\" said Marta Corona, a 60-year-old tourist holding a fan.\n\n\"People come asking for water and drinks, that's what sells, because with this heat you have to cope somehow,\" said Fernando Serrano, a 69-year-old kiosk owner at his stand.\n\nThe heatwave comes hot on the heels of a series of tumbling records, including Europe's hottest March ever, according to the EU's Copernicus climate monitor.\n\nAccording to Copernicus and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Europe has been warming at roughly twice the global average since the 1980s.\n\nAs a result of the planet's warming, extreme weather events including hurricanes, droughts, floods and heatwaves like this weekend's have become more frequent and intense, scientists warn.\n\nBy some estimates 2024, the hottest year in recorded history so far, saw worldwide disasters that cost more than $300 billion.\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP)",

        "content": "Paris CNN —\n\nExtreme heat has engulfed parts of western Europe, with wildfires raging in France and Spain, a worsening drought in Portugal, and the third hottest day on record in the UK on Monday.\n\nFire has spread across 27,000 acres in the Gironde department of southwest France, forcing 32,000 people to evacuate, the local prefecture said Monday night.\n\nThe nearby town of Cazaux recorded 42.4 degrees Celsius (108.3 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday, the hottest it has seen since its weather station first opened more than 100 years ago in 1921, according to French national meteorological service Météo France.\n\nMajor cities in Western France, such as Nantes and Brest, also hit new heat records, it said.\n\nIn Finistère, on the country’s Atlantic coast, fires had first been reported on Monday afternoon; less than eight hours later, the flames had decimated more than 700 acres of land, prompting the evacuation of several villages.\n\nIn Spain, wildfires swept the central region of Castile and Léon, as well as the northern region of Galicia Sunday, Reuters reported. Fire also forced the state railway company to suspend service between Madrid and Galicia.\n\nMore than 70,000 hectares have been destroyed in Spain because of fires this year, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday. “Seventy-thousand hectares, to give you an idea, is almost double the last decade’s average,” he said.\n\nThe heat wave in Portugal has intensified a pre-existing drought and sparked wildfires in central parts of the country, including in the village of Memoria, in the Leiria municipality. Paulo Cunha/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nThe country’s Carlos III Health Institute on Monday estimated a cumulative total of more than 510 heatwave-related deaths in the country, based on statistical calculation of excess deaths.\n\nHundreds have also died in neighboring Portugal, where sweltering temperatures exacerbate a severe drought.\n\nOn Saturday, Portugal’s Health Ministry said 659 mainly elderly people had died in the previous seven days, Reuters reported.\n\nAn elderly couple also died Monday after their vehicle overturned while fleeing wildfires in northern Portugal, the country’s state broadcaster RTP reported.\n\nIn total, over 1,100 people are thought to have died due to the ongoing heatwave in southern Europe.\n\n‘Peak of intensity’\n\nThe blistering heat wave is expected to peak early this week.\n\nAs the heatwave moves across the country, French capital Paris is expected to reach 39 degrees Celsius (102.2 degrees Fahrenheit) on Tuesday.\n\nIn the UK – where Monday’s temperatures reached 38.1 degrees in eastern England’s Santon Downham, making it the third hottest day on record – officials warned things would likely get worse.\n\nThe head of the UK's Met Office said the country could experience the \"hottest day\" on record Monday. Alberto Pezzali/AP\n\nTuesday is “expected to be even hotter,” according to the Met Office’s CEO, Penelope Endersby.\n\n“It’s tomorrow that we’re really seeing the higher chance of 40 degrees and temperatures above that,” Endersby told BBC Radio on Monday.\n\n“Even possibly above that, 41 is not off the cards. We’ve even got some 43s in the model but we’re hoping it won’t be as high as that.”\n\nIn France, the heat wave is expected to move away from the western part of the country on Tuesday, heading toward the center and eastern part instead, including Paris.\n\nBelgium’s Royal Meteorological Institute (KMI/IRM) has issued a “code red” weather warning for heat in two provinces on Tuesday, forecasting temperatures up to 40 Celsius in the west and southwest.\n\n“With such very high temperatures certain measures will be necessary: drink regularly, wear lighter clothes, spend the day in cooler rooms, monitor the state of your health regularly, eat easily digestible food (and in smaller portions), keep doors and windows closed to keep the heat out. Pets and animals also need extra care,” it warned residents.\n\nFacing drought\n\nNearly half of Europe’s territory, including the UK, is “at risk” of drought, researchers at the EU Commission said Monday.\n\nThe Joint Research Centre highlighted that the drought in much of Europe is “critical” as the “winter-spring precipitation deficit … was exacerbated by early heatwaves in May and June.”\n\nWater supply may be “compromised” in the coming months, according to the report.\n\nSpeaking to CNN on Monday, Oxford University Professor Myles Allen warned that such heatwaves will be inevitable if mankind doesn’t soon reduce its carbon emissions.\n\n“This isn’t a new normal because we’re just on a trend towards ever hotter temperatures,” Allen told CNN on Monday.\n\nThe solution, he said, is sweeping change across the energy industry. Individual companies are unlikely to change their business models unilaterally due to concerns over losing competitiveness with rivals, he added.\n\n“It’s got to be a regulation on the industry as a whole,” said Allen.",

        "content": "Elizabeth O’Connell of Northeastern University-London worked through Britain’s record breaking heat wave Tuesday at home with her curtains closed and a Dyson fan at her side.\n\n“Regular cold showers are a must,” says O’Connell, director of marketing and admissions for Northeastern’s London location.\n\n“Dog walks now take place at 6 a.m. when it is relatively cool. Few homes have air conditioning, as historically we have not experienced the temperatures to warrant its installation,” she says in an email.\n\nThe heat wave striking Europe has sent temperatures in Britain above 40 degrees Celsius–or 104 Fahrenheit—for the first time ever, caused wildfires in France and killed more than 1,000 people in Spain and Portugal.\n\nNortheastern University professors say it is a sign of more to come as climate change continues to create extreme weather challenges.\n\n“Continents across the globe are going through enormous heat waves,” says Auroop Ganguly, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Northeastern University.\n\n“It’s not that they have never happened before. They have not happened continuously for this long and over and over,” he says.\n\n“We are seeing records being broken almost each successive year.”\n\nAuroop Ganguly, professor of of civil and environmental engineering at Northeastern University.

Photos by Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University\n\nTo say that northern latitudes such as Britain were unprepared for the broiler to be turned on is an understatement.\n\n“Our overall lack of readiness for extreme heat extends to our overall infrastructure,” O’Connell reports from London.\n\n“So while some of my luckier colleagues are working in the wonderfully air-conditioned campus at St. Katharine Docks, many staff have been unable to travel to the campus for reasons such as train cancellations and no air conditioning in the Tube or buses,” she says.\n\nCBS News reported that hundreds of trains were canceled in Britain, and people were advised not to take public transportation. It said London’s Luton Airport had to cancel flights after part of the runway melted.\n\nBut it’s not just Europe.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Central Asia and Oklahoma and Texas are currently baking in excessive heat.\n\nLast month, Phoenix and Las Vegas experienced record daily high temperatures, while the North African city of Tunis experienced a scorching record high of 118 degrees Fahrenheit on July 13, according to NASA.\n\n“It is extraordinary, but it’s completely expected,” says Samuel Munoz, Northeastern University assistant professor of marine and environmental sciences.\n\n“Environmental and climate scientists have been predicting an increase in extreme weather events for years due to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the climate,” Munoz says.\n\n“We’re going to keep breaking records,” he says.\n\nThe combination of larger wildfires, hotter heat waves and more intense hurricanes is prompting experts at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Cambridge to dub summer “the danger season.”\n\nUnion of Concerned Scientists principal climate scientist Kristina Dahl said in a June blog post that the dangers are many: heat stress and heat stroke, mold exposure in flood-damaged homes and poor air quality from wildfires.\n\nThe extreme weather events “compound one another and cause cascading chains of hazards,” Dahl writes.\n\nAs an example, she says, the “megadrought” in the U.S. Southwest is making fires more difficult to contain, resulting last month in New Mexico experiencing its largest wildfire ever, the Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon fire.\n\nExtreme weather poses a risk to summer tourism, making travel inconvenient or downright dangerous in beloved destinations around the globe.\n\nThis month, the Washburn wildfire threatened Yosemite’s National Park famed Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias, and a collapsing glacier killed 11 hikers in the Italian Dolomites, one day after record heat was recorded at the base of the glacier.\n\nSamuel Munoz, Assistant Professor in the Department of Marine & Environmental Sciences, says, “We’re going to keep breaking records.” Photo by Alyssa Stone/Northeastern University\n\nEarlier this summer, historic floods temporarily closed Yellowstone National Park for the first time in 34 years.\n\nIncreased flooding is as much a part of climate change as heat waves and drought, Munoz says.\n\n“A warmer atmosphere is a ‘thirstier’ atmosphere, increasing the likelihood of droughts and wildfires by causing more water to evaporate from the earth’s surface,” he says.\n\n“At the same time, the extra water held in the atmosphere can also create heavier rainstorms that cause flooding,” Munoz says.\n\nIn the case of Yellowstone, scenic roads were built next to rivers when there was a low likelihood the roads would get flooded and washed out.\n\n“We designed and built infrastructure for a 20th century climate. It might not work as well for a 21st century climate,” Munoz says.\n\nThe impact of extreme events on critical infrastructure can determine the difference between life and death, Dahl writes in her blog post.\n\nDuring “the massive heatwave that followed on the heels of Hurricane Ida in Louisiana in 2021, for instance, residents of the state were left without water or power for weeks,” she says.\n\n“In Louisiana, the inability to cool off in the wake of the storm ultimately led to more deaths due to heat after the storm than to the storm itself even as the storm (traveled) northward, wreaking havoc and claiming dozens of lives from Mississippi to New York.”\n\nOfficials who have planned around extreme weather events occurring every 100 to 500 years are finding that the pace has picked up dramatically, Ganguly says.\n\nHe says locations in India and Pakistan that are used to high temperatures are experiencing heat beyond expectations.\n\nClimate change, sea level rise, groundwater extraction and aging infrastructure are all occurring at once, says Ganguly, who 13 years ago published a paper anticipating higher than predicted temperature trends.\n\n“It’s almost become a perfect storm,” he says\n\n“These are the things we have to design for,” Ganguly says.\n\nGanguly recently returned from a study abroad trip to Tanzania as part of Northeastern University’s Dialogue of Civilizations program, where Northeastern science, engineering, social science and computer science students learned about the infrastructure of the low-income, tourist-dependent nation.\n\n“There has been a steady state of warming in Tanzania and heavy rainfall-induced floods, but there have been droughts in other parts of the country that have caused issues with crops,” Ganguly says.\n\nClimate change is a global problem, but countries with low levels of resources and incomes are more affected than wealthier nations, Ganguly says.\n\n“Many more people potentially lose their lives” or face a difficult economic recovery from disaster, he says.\n\nBut Tanzania, which is responsible for a small fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions, presents an opportunity to build a resilient infrastructure with critical redundancies built into the system, while also making efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, in ways that can serve as a model for the world, Ganguly says.\n\n“They almost have to start from scratch,” he says, “which can enable them to bake resilience into infrastructure design while simultaneously ensuring operational efficiency.”\n\nWith some help from industrialized nations and technology, it’s likely that places at most risk of climate change such as Tanzania can make progress without burning that much more fossil fuel, while also adapting better to climate change, Ganguly says.\n\nWhen it comes to climate change, what happens in one country doesn’t stay there, he says.\n\n“We share what is happening to the planet.”",

Read our Privacy notice\n\nMultiple storms and a severe heatwave have swept across China, killing dozens, damaging infrastructure and disrupting travel as authorities brace for more heavy rain and rising temperatures.\n\nTyphoon Wipha made landfall in southern Guangdong province on Sunday evening, battering cities like Yangjiang, Zhanjiang and Maoming with winds of over 118kmph and dumping torrential rain that uprooted trees, triggered landslides and left thousands without power.\n\nThe system also disrupted travel across the Pearl River Delta, grounding more than 900 flights in Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen and Zhuhai.\n\nHong Kong was briefly placed under its maximum typhoon warning as gusts exceeded 167kmph and scaffolding collapsed in parts of the city. Authorities reported 471 fallen trees and at least 26 injuries linked to the storm.\n\nHong Kong's airport authority said 80,000 travellers were hit by the rescheduling of 400 flights forced by the typhoon.\n\nBy Sunday night, the typhoon weakened to a severe tropical storm as it moved inland, but the threat of flooding and landslides persisted across southern China, including Guangxi and Hainan.\n\nopen image in gallery Dark clouds gather and rough seas are seen in Victoria harbour as the typhoon signal number 10 is hoisted as Typhoon Wipha moves towards Hong Kong ( AFP via Getty Images )\n\nLocal forecasters warned that the system could re-intensify over the Gulf of Tonkin before making landfall in northern Vietnam.\n\nMeanwhile, torrential rain continued across parts of China already inundated by earlier storms. In July alone, flooding, landslides and storm surges have affected millions across coastal provinces, including Guangdong, Fujian and Guangxi.\n\nA separate set of storms triggered flash floods in Henan and Gansu last week, where rivers burst their banks, buildings collapsed, and at least seven people were killed or reported missing.\n\nThe Ministry of Emergency Management said China’s first-half disaster toll included at least 307 people dead or missing, over 23 million affected residents, and more than $7.6bn in economic damage, with the bulk caused by weather-related events.\n\nWhile southern regions battled floods, other parts of China faced record-breaking heat. Temperatures soared to 46C in Xi’an this month, with surface readings exceeding 70C in some cities.\n\nopen image in gallery A drone view shows buildings and roads are half submerged in floodwaters after heavy rainfalls, in Rongjiang county, Guizhou province, China ( via REUTERS )\n\nRed alerts were issued in provinces including Shaanxi and Yunnan, prompting cooling shelters and curbs on outdoor work as electricity demand hit historic highs.\n\nThe National Meteorological Centre has warned of continued extreme weather through July and August, China’s typical peak season for typhoons and floods.\n\nChen Min, China’s vice-minister of water resources, warned at a news conference earlier this month that the “global trend of climate warming is evident” in China.\n\n“In recent years, more frequent, intense and widespread extreme weather events have led to more abrupt, severe and abnormal disasters such as heavy rainfall, floods and droughts,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, monsoon continued to create mayhem in South Korea in the east and Indian subcontinent in the west.\n\nAt least 18 people have died and 9 were missing after five days of record-breaking rain triggered flash floods and landslides in South Korea. Over 14,000 people have been evacuated nationwide, and the government has dispatched thousands of troops for recovery work. In Gapyeong, one man died after calling his wife to say his car was being swept away, while entire villages in Sancheong were buried in mudslides.\n\nIn India, intense rainfall and landslides in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have killed at least 140 people since late June. Roads, bridges and homes have been swept away in mountain districts, with cloudbursts triggering deadly flash floods.\n\nIn Nepal, a glacial lake outburst on the Chinese border on 8 July sent a wall of water downstream, destroying the Friendship Bridge, submerging vehicles, and killing at least nine people. Nineteen others remain missing.\n\nPakistan has also suffered one of its deadliest monsoons since the devastating floods of 2022. More than 200 people have died, including dozens of children, and over 560 have been injured in rain-related incidents since June 26, with Punjab province the worst affected.",

        "content": "By the Climate Centre\n\nThe Red Crescent Society of Kyrgyzstan this weekend completed a series of early actions for heatwave in the south of the country begun when it activated its early action protocol after severe heat up to 40°C was forecast in three regions: Osh, Jalal-Abad Region and Batken, lasting at least until Tuesday.\n\nMeasures taken include hygiene kits, food parcels, and psychosocial support kits for 12,500 vulnerable people (in 2,500 households), and portable air-conditioners and child-focused kits for a further 2,500.\n\nThe EAP – worth nearly 250,000 Swiss francs from the IFRC-DREF anticipatory pillar – was developed by the Red Crescent in 2023 with support from the German Federal Foreign Office and Red Cross; an earlier edition was activated in 2022.\n\nLocal adaptation ‘outpaced’?\n\nWorld Weather Attribution scientists have said an “extraordinary” spring heatwave in Central Asia was driven by climate change and was the second-largest increase of nearly 30 heat events they had studied.\n\nTheir study found Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan recorded March temperatures up to 15°C above average, threatening glaciers, water supplies, hydroelectricity and farming.\n\nA report from the World Bank last month on heat and cities in Europe and Central Asia said that even some Central Asian cities with historically milder climates — including Astana in Kazakhstan, Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan and Tashkent in Uzbekistan — witnessed “high heat-related mortality [suggesting] that recent increases in heat exposure may have outpaced local adaptation”.\n\nVolunteers from the northern Talas regional branch of the Kyrgyzstan Red Crescent earlier this month conducting a public health campaign on how to stay safe during a heatwave. The work was “an important step in raising public awareness about how to protect themselves and their loved ones from the negative effects of abnormal heat,” the National Society website said.

        "content": "Record-breaking heat has killed over 1,000 people in Western Europe over the past week, while firefighters battle to contain blazes scorching swathes of three countries amid a worsening climate emergency, officials said this weekend.\n\nEl Pais reports heat killed 360 people in Spain between July 10 and July 15. This follows the heat-related deaths of more than 800 people last month, according to the Spanish government's Carlos III Health Institute. Madrid-Barajas International Airport recorded an all-time high temperature of 108degF Thursday, while some Spanish municipalities registered highs of 110degF to 113degF.\n\nOne 60-year-old Madrid sanitation worker collapsed in the middle of the street while working Friday. The man was rushed to the hospital with a body temperature of over 106degF and died of heat stroke. He was one of 123 people who suffered heat-related deaths Friday in Spain.\n\nIn drought-ravaged Portugal, where temperatures soared to over 116deg in Pinhao on Friday, the Health Ministry said Saturday that 659 people, most of them elderly, have died from heat-related causes over the past week.\n\nIn Britain, the U.K. Met Office on Friday issued its first-ever Red Extreme heat warning for Monday and Tuesday, when an \"exceptional hot spell\" is expected to hit the country.\n\nAccuWeather senior meteorologist Tyler Roys said \"there is concern that this heat could become a long-duration heatwave\" lasting into August in places including \"the valleys of Hungary, eastern Croatia, eastern Bosnia, Serbia, southern Romania, and northern Bulgaria.\"\n\nParts of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia are also suffering heatwaves and wildfires.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 10,000 people in France, Spain, and Portugal have been evacuated as firefighters battle out-of-control wildfires burning throughout parts of those countries. More than half of Portugal is on red alert status as firefighters work to contain 14 separate conflagrations.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press:\n\nHungary, Croatia, and the Greek island of Crete have also fought wildfires this week, as have Morocco and California. Italy is in the midst of an early summer heatwave, coupled with the worst drought in its north in 70 years--conditions linked to a recent disaster, when a huge chunk of the Marmolada glacier broke loose, killing several hikers. Scorching temperatures have even reached northern Europe. An annual four-day walking event in the Dutch city of Nijmegen announced Sunday that it would cancel the first day, scheduled for Tuesday, when temperatures are expected to peak at around 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nStudies have shown that the human-driven climate emergency is increasing the frequency and severity of heatwaves.",

        "content": "Heatwaves have been wreaking havoc across Europe in recent months, causing wildfires, droughts and deaths.\n\nExperts worry that these heatwaves could become the new normal in the region.\n\nHere are 5 key things to know about Europe's extreme summer weather.\n\n5 key things to know about Europe's extreme heatwaves. Image: Visual Capitalist.\n\nFor the last few months, Europe’s smoldering heatwave has been wreaking havoc across the region, causing destructive wildfires, severe droughts, and thousands of deaths.\n\nThe EU’s record-breaking temperatures are making headlines around the world, as experts worry these extreme heatwaves could be the region’s new normal.\n\nEurope's heatwaves\n\nGiven the volume of coverage on the topic, we sifted through dozens of articles and Twitter threads (so you don’t have to) and complied a list of the five major things to know about Europe’s smothering heatwave.\n\n1. High temperatures are shattering records\n\nTemperatures have been hitting all-time highs across the region.\n\nOn Monday, July 18, dozens of towns across France reported record-breaking temperatures of up to 42°C (107.6°F). In the same week, the U.K. experienced its hottest day on record at 40.3°C (104.5°F), breaking Britain’s previous record of (38.7°C) 101.7°F that was set back in 2019.\n\nThe heat in London was so unprecedented, the city’s national rail service issued a warning to the public, urging passengers to stay home and only travel if necessary. Some major rail lines were even closed for parts of the day on Tuesday, July 19.\n\n2. Europe is feeling the heatwave burn\n\nThe smoldering heat is fueling disastrous wildfires across the continent. As of July 20, an estimated 1,977 wildfires have blazed across the region in 2022—almost 3x the average amount, according to historical data from the European Forest Fire Information System.\n\nMediterranean countries have been hit particularly hard, with thousands of people in Portugal, Spain, and France evacuating their homes.\n\n3. Going with the (low) flow\n\nAlong with the devastating wildfires, Europe’s heatwave is also causing a series of droughts across the region.\n\nWhile most European cities have at least one river or lake crossing their urban landscape, these rivers and bodies of water are at risk of drying out. For instance in early July, Italy’s Po River was experiencing a drought so severe, that the country’s government issued a state of emergency in five different regions.\n\n4. Energy demands are creating an awkward situation\n\nLast year, Europe set ambitious goals to cut 55% of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\n\nBut, in the wake of a global energy crisis, many European countries have put their green transition plans on hold as they turn to “dirtier” fuels like coal to keep their economies running business-as-usual. This timing is a tad awkward, considering the fact the region is currently ablaze with record-breaking temperatures that experts believe are human-induced.\n\nThe aforementioned “low flow” on many European rivers are also impacting hydroelectricity and even nuclear electricity generation, as too little water is available for cooling purposes.\n\nOn the bright side, at least Germany has made some progress in the realm of renewable energy—on July 17, the country generated a record-breaking amount of electricity from solar panels.\n\n5. Climate change is a factor, but heatwaves are complicated\n\nExperts claim that climate change is playing a part in these record-breaking heatwaves. Around the world, global surface temperatures have risen by about 1.0°C (1.8°F) since the 1850s, and scientists claim this temperature increase has been indisputably influenced by human activity.\n\nHowever, there may be other factors that are influencing these extreme heatwaves. While the exact specifics are difficult to nail down due to the variable nature of the climate, a recent study published in Nature Communications found that Europe’s escalating heatwaves could be partly attributed to changing air currents, which are blowing hot air from North Africa to Europe.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nAt least 1,500 lives have been lost so far amidst this record-breaking heatwave. And since temperatures are expected to remain high across the region for at least another week, this figure will likely increase.\n\nEuropean homes are generally not well equipped for exceptionally high temperatures, and since the continent has the oldest median age of any region, its population is particularly susceptible to the negative effects of extreme weather.\n\nLivelihoods are also being impacted by the extreme weather. Temperatures are drying out soil, which is creating poor growing conditions for corn farmers in France, Romania, and Spain, the region’s top corn producers.\n\nLong story short—Europe’s heatwave is having disastrous effects on its economy and infrastructure, as well as the overall wellbeing of the region’s population.",

        "content": "watch now\n\nA deadly heat wave in Western Europe has triggered intense wildfires, disrupted transportation and displaced thousands of people as the continent grapples with the impact of climate change. The record-breaking heat is forecast to grow more severe this week and has prompted concerns over infrastructure problems such as melting roads, widespread power outages and warped train tracks. Several areas in France have experienced record-breaking temperatures that approached or surpassed 100 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the national weather forecaster. In Britain, where few homes have air conditioning, the highest temperature has also reached nearly 100 degrees Fahrenheit, falling just below the national record.\n\nFirefighters operate at the site of a wildfire in Pumarejo de Tera near Zamora, northern Spain, on June 18, 2022. Cesar Manso | AFP | Getty Images\n\nAt least five countries in Europe have declared states of emergency or red warnings as wildfires, fueled by the hot conditions, burn across France, Greece, Portugal and Spain. In the past week, more than 31,000 people have been displaced from their homes because of blazes in the Gironde region of Southwestern France. Climate change has made heat waves and droughts more common, intense and widespread. Dry and hot conditions also exacerbate wildfires, which have grown more destructive in recent years. And lower nighttime temperatures that typically provide critical relief from the hot days are disappearing as the Earth warms. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain said Monday that he had visited areas impacted by wildfires in the western region of Extremadura. \"Climate change kills people, our ecosystem and what is most precious to us,\" Sánchez said.\n\nTourists fill the Levante beach in Benidorm to quench high temperatures as a heatwave sweeps across Spain on July 16, 2022 in Benidorm, Spain. Zowy Voeten | Getty Images\n\nAt least 350 people have died in Spain from high temperatures during the past week, according to estimates by Spain's Carlos III Health Institute. In Portugal, health officials said that nearly 240 people died in the first half of July due to the high temperatures, which reached 117 degrees Fahrenheit earlier in the month. In the U.K., train service was limited amid concerns that the rails would buckle in the heat. The U.K. Met Office, for the first time ever, issued a red warning for heat, its most extreme alert. And Wales recorded its highest-ever temperature of 98.8 Fahrenheit on Monday, according to Britain's national weather service.\n\nAn aerial view shows boats in the dry bed of Brenets Lake (Lac des Brenets), part of the Doubs River, a natural border between eastern France and western Switzerland, in Les Brenets on July 18, 2022. Fabrice Coffrini | AFP | Getty Images\n\nFlights were also delayed and disrupted into and out of Luton Airport in London after a defect was identified on the runway surface due to extreme temperatures, according to the airport. Temperatures had reached 94 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday in north London and were forecast to rise on Tuesday. As people across Europe endured the heat, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres issued a dire warning to leaders from 40 nations gathered in Berlin to discuss climate change response measures as part of the Petersberg Climate Dialogue. \"Half of humanity is in the danger zone from floods, droughts, extreme storms and wildfires. No nation is immune. Yet we continue to feed our fossil fuel addiction,\" Guterres said in a video message to the leaders on Monday. —The Associated Press contributed reporting.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nNew records have been set as temperatures topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) across much of Spain and Portugal Wednesday amid a persistent heat wave across western Europe.\n\nIn northwest Spain, the city of Ourense set its all-time temperature record of 43.2 degrees Celsius (109.76 degrees Fahrenheit) on Tuesday, according to Spain’s meteorological agency, AEMET.\n\nOn Wednesday, Zamora set its own record after reaching 41.1 degrees Celsius (105.98 degrees Fahrenheit), according to climate statistician Max Herrera. Soria set a record of 38.7 degrees Celsius (101.66 degrees Fahrenheit) that same day.\n\nThe central Portuguese town of Lousã set an all-time record of 46.3 degrees Celsius (115.34 degrees Fahrenheit) and Lisbon set a July record of 41.4 degrees Celsius (106.52 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nBut the worst is yet to come.\n\nSpain and Portugal brace themselves\n\nPeople cool off with a fountain's water during a heat wave in Seville, Spain on July 12. Jorge Guerrero/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOfficials in Spain and Portugal are bracing themselves for the hottest day of the heat wave so far.\n\nTemperatures are set to reach around 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of western and southern Spain, according to AEMET. In its afternoon update, AEMET warned that Spain is set to experience its hottest day of the heat wave on Thursday.\n\nSimilar is being said of Portugal. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa told reporters that Thursday is set to be the “most serious day” for Portugal as far as the extreme weather is concerned, warning that the country needs “to be more careful than ever to avoid new occurrences.”\n\nEight out of the country’s 18 mainland districts have been placed under a red weather warning by the Portuguese Institute for the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA).\n\nIn light of the heightened risk, the country’s “state of alarm” is set to be extended until Sunday, Costa added.\n\nA member of the armed forces walks near a forest fire in Palmela, Portugal on July 13. The fire is currently close to a petrol station. In an effort to save their lives, some people and animals are being evacuated. Andre Luis Alves/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nPortugal continues to be one of the countries hardest hit by the current heat wave across western Europe. There are currently 1,656 firefighters fighting the 10 active rural fires across Portugal, the Portuguese Civil Protection Services said Thursday.\n\nMore than 7,400 acres of forest have been burned in the Leiria district in central Portugal, according to the municipality of Leiria.\n\nThousands evacuated due to wildfires\n\nFrance is in a similar predicament. Since Tuesday, more than 6,500 people have been evacuated from their homes and campsites as wildfires rage in the country’s southwestern regions, according to regional police on Thursday.\n\nMore than 9,000 acres have been destroyed by two large forest fires in the Gironde department, according to a statement published by the department’s police.\n\nA wildfire burns through vegetation in Landiras, southwestern France, on July 13. Laurent Theillet/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAround 1,000 firefighters from local and national brigades have been mobilized since Tuesday to stop the spread of the fires. Six water bomber planes are also being used.\n\nGrégory Allione, president of the national federation of firefighters, called on towns around the country to cancel their traditional Bastille Day firework displays, speaking on French channel Franceinfo on Thursday.\n\n“What is responsible, is to cancel them, what is responsible is to take into account that we are in a period of drought, of heat waves,” Allione said, adding that the fires “are still evolving, we expect to face difficulties today given the rise in temperature and the whirling winds.”\n\nFirefighters work to extinguish a wildfire which broke out at the bottom of the Dune du Pilat near Teste-de-Buch, southwestern France on July 13. Thibaud Moritz/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDuring a visit to the area on Wednesday, Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin told journalists that authorities “were on very high alert in the coming days, especially in the south of France.”\n\nThe UK is next\n\nThe peak of the heat is occurring now across the Iberian Peninsula, and is set to spread to the north and east in the coming days.\n\nA “rare” amber extreme heat warning issued by the UK Met Office for Sunday, July 17, has been extended to Monday and Tuesday, when temperatures are expected to be in the mid 30s.\n\nThe UK’s record high temperature is 38.7 degrees Celsius (101.7 degrees Fahrenheit), which could be surpassed, according to the Met Office.\n\n“Some models have been producing maximum temperatures in excess of 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the UK over the coming weekend and beyond,” the Met Office’s Rebekah Sherwin said.\n\n“Population-wide adverse health effects are likely to be experienced, not limited to those most vulnerable to extreme heat, leading to potential serious illness or danger to life,” the Met Office said. “Significantly more people are likely to visit coastal areas, lakes and rivers leading to increased risk of water safety incidents.”\n\nThe UK could also experience road closures due to melting surfaces, as well as delays to rail and air travel in the thick of the extreme heat.",

        "content": "July 21, 2025\n\nA prolonged stretch of unusually hot, midsummer heat and humidity will grip a large portion of the United States from July 21 to 25. What began across the Southeast over the weekend is forecast to expand into the mid-South early in the week, then expand into the Midwest by mid-to-late week.\n\nA Climate Central analysis finds that human-caused climate change made this excessive heat at least three times more likely for nearly 160 million people, nearly half of the U.S. population.\n\nNote: This event may continue beyond July 25. Use the Global Climate Shift Index map to stay updated on heat in your region.\n\nHow unusual is the forecasted heat?\n\nTriple-digit highs are forecast for multiple days in parts of Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, northern Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas. Forecast highs in the mid-to-upper 90s spread into the lower Midwest by midweek, with similar temperatures possible in the Northeast by late week.\n\nHigh humidity will intensify the heat, especially in the Central Plains, Midwest, and Mississippi and Ohio valleys, where heat index values could reach between 105°F to 110°F .\n\nUnusually warm overnight lows in the mid-70s to low 80s — as much as 5°F to 15°F above average for this time of the year — are forecast to potentially break record high minimums (the warmest low temperatures on record) in states like Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, South Carolina, and Tennessee .\n\nA strong area of high pressure, known as a heat dome, will anchor this weather pattern, funneling hot, humid air north and northeast throughout the week.\n\nHow has climate change influenced this heat?\n\nClimate Shift Index (CSI) levels of 5 — the highest possible — are forecast across wide swaths of the country, from Salt Lake City and Santa Fe to Tallahassee and Montgomery, meaning human-caused climate change made this extreme heat at least five times more likely. This signals an exceptional climate-influenced event.\n\nOver the full period, nearly 160 million people across the interior United States — nearly half of the population — will experience at least one day with a CSI of 3 or higher, indicating a strong influence from climate change.\n\nWhat do experts say?\n\nDr. Kristina Dahl, VP of Science at Climate Central, said:\n\n“This is not your grandmother’s heat wave. Yes, July is usually a hot month, but climate change is making this heat wave significantly hotter — and therefore more dangerous — than heat waves of the past.”\n\nTo request an interview with a Climate Central scientist, please contact Abbie Veitch at aveitch@climatecentral.org.\n\nHow do we know climate change is influencing this heat?\n\nThe Climate Shift Index uses peer-reviewed methodology and real-time data to estimate how climate change has increased the likelihood of a particular daily temperature.\n\nReporting resources",

        "content": "Extreme temperatures Climate change Air quality Pollution See all topics Follow\n\nThe intensifying and expansive heat wave affecting around 150 million people in the United States from Wisconsin to Washington, DC, bears the hallmarks of human-caused global warming.\n\nHundreds of daily temperature records are threatened during the next few days, particularly along the East Coast, and some all-time June high temperature records could be tied or broken as well.\n\nMilestones for record warm overnight low temperatures are also being set — another sign of climate change. Nighttime temperatures have been warming faster than daytime, which exacerbates the health consequences from heat waves. This is especially the case in cities, where the urban heat island effect keeps temperatures high overnight.\n\nThe US heat wave comes nearly in tandem with searing high temperatures in Western Europe, which global warming made far more likely and intense.\n\nOf all the forms of extreme weather — droughts, floods, hurricanes — heat waves are the ones that scientists can most reliably tie to climate change caused by fossil fuel pollution. As the world warms, the odds of extreme heat events increase dramatically, while the odds and severity of record cold extremes decrease.\n\n“The physical process of how more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere lead to hotter and more frequent heatwaves is well-understood and straightforward,” said Fredi Otto, a climate scientist who leads the World Weather Attribution project, an international effort that examines the role climate change plays in individual weather events.\n\n“Every heatwave that is occurring today is hotter than it would have been without human-induced climate change,” she said.\n\nThe heat waves we are experiencing now are occurring in 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.16 degrees Fahrenheit) of global warming, with even more severe heat likely in coming decades as global average temperatures continue to climb.\n\nIn recent years, researchers have found that some heat waves would have been impossible without the temperature boost from global warming. Others have been made tens to hundreds of times more likely, and hotter than they would have been without the effects of climate pollution.\n\nA shopper holds a bag of ice in a check out line at a grocery store during 90-degree temperatures on June 20, in Boulder, Colorado. Mark Makela/Getty Images\n\nThis was the case with the Pacific Northwest heat wave of 2021, a Siberian heat wave in 2020 and a United Kingdom heat wave in 2022, among other more recent events.\n\nIn short, climate change is causing heat waves to become more common, intense and longer-lasting. They are also hitting both earlier and later in the warm season, and in many parts of the world are becoming more humid, too, which makes them more dangerous.\n\nSome studies have shown that global weather patterns conducive to simultaneous heat waves on different continents, such as the US and European heat waves this month, are becoming more common during the Northern Hemisphere summer.\n\nAccording to a rapid scientific analysis, the UK heat wave this month, which brought temperatures up to 92 degrees Fahrenheit in Surrey, England, was 100 times more likely to occur in today’s climate than prior to the human-caused global warming era.\n\nThree straight days of temperatures above 82 degrees in southeastern England are now about 100 times more likely to occur compared to the pre-global warming era, the analysis said, before humans began burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas for energy.\n\nIn the US, heat waves are the deadliest form of extreme weather. The ongoing one is particularly threatening because it is the first of the season, bringing conditions more common during the peak of summer, not in June.\n\nPoeple walk across the Big Four Bridge as the sun sets at Waterfront Park on June 22 in Louisville, Kentucky. Jon Cherry/AP\n\nTemperatures are set to soar near or into the triple digits along the Amtrak Acela corridor from Washington to New York City, with heat indices climbing as high as 110 degrees or even higher in some locations. Such conditions will make it dangerous to be outdoors for extended periods of time, and the lack of overnight heat relief will compound the public health threat.\n\nIn most parts of the world outside of the tropics, including the US and the UK, heat waves occurring now would have been up to 7 degrees cooler without the burning of fossil fuels, Otto said.\n\n“Through its influence on extreme heat, human-induced climate change puts a massive burden on societies, leading to thousands of premature deaths, and a large strain on infrastructure and ecosystems,” Otto said. “In addition, extreme heat is leading to agricultural losses and a large loss in productivity.”\n\nOtto sounded an additional note of caution: Computer models “severely underestimate” the extreme heat trends we are seeing so far, which means projections for future extreme heat are likely also underestimates.\n\nThis is thought to be because of changes in air pollutants known as aerosols as well as shifts in weather patterns that may also be caused by climate change.\n\nMichael Mann, a climate researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, has also found models struggle with heat wave projections in the context of climate change. His research has found an increase in the occurrence of persistent heat domes in recent years, like the one occurring now, which have rarely been picked up by the climate models.\n\n“Climate models are likely understating the relationship between climate change and persistent summer weather extremes today and under predicting the potential for future increases in such extremes,” he told CNN.",

        "content": "James Webb has done it again: turning all theories about how supermassive black holes form upside down! It’s called “Infinity Galaxy” and it probably sounds familiar, it was discovered by NASA (yes, the same NASA that Trump wants to shut down) and it shows what appears to be a black hole born at the centre of a cosmic collision between two galaxies.\n\nThis scene is not only striking but also provides evidence (real evidence!) that could confirm a long-debated theory: the direct collapse of gas clouds as the origin of these giants of the universe!!! Here’s everything you need to know.\n\nA striking shape with a secret inside\n\nAt first sight, the image might seem like a curiosity, just a pretty photo, nothing special. But wait, in reality, it shows two red, intense, and bright cores surrounded by rings that, together, form the shape of an infinity symbol in space, like a vow of eternal love!\n\nBut of course, the Webb telescope has detected something much more fascinating between those cores: a dense gas cloud that appears to be feeding the birth of a supermassive black hole.\n\nThese types of black holes aren’t the usual ones that form when a star collapses. Supermassive ones can be millions of times larger than our sun, and their origin is still not fully understood.\n\nWhat is direct collapse?\n\nLet’s explain this theory, it has been around for years and fits perfectly with what Webb has shown us. It’s called “direct collapse” and it proposes that, instead of forming through multiple mergers of small black holes, some of these space monsters are born directly from the collapse of huge clouds of interstellar gas.\n\nThis makes a lot of sense when we remember that supermassive black holes have already been detected in very early periods of the universe! But maybe you don’t remember… So if they had formed only through successive mergers of smaller black holes, they wouldn’t have had enough time to grow so large.\n\nThe Infinity Galaxy\n\nRight, based on this image alone, what we seem to be seeing here are two galaxies colliding. And sure, stars are born from chaos, but in this case, it has created a space colossus!\n\nAccording to Pieter van Dokkum, one of the lead authors of this study, the two galaxies collided, which generated a huge shock and compression of gas between them. This extreme compression would have formed a dense core, which could have collapsed directly into a new black hole!!!\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nOkay… they still can’t confirm anything with total certainty, but the data supports the theory, and on top of that, other explanations have lost strength after this image! It’s not just a visual coincidence, but an image that could rewrite part of our understanding of the early universe!!\n\nWhat now?\n\nThe team will continue analyzing all the data to try to confirm this hypothesis. But for now, this structure (the one we’re calling “Infinity Galaxy”) has become a sort of natural laboratory where scientists can study how the first supermassive black holes were born. The kind that, by the way, today dominate the centers of galaxies like ours.\n\nWebb keeps surprising us\n\nEver since it started showing us space, it hasn’t stopped amazing us! Every time James Webb reveals something…\n\nSince it began sending stunning images of the deep universe, the James Webb Space Telescope has completely changed the way we look at the cosmos. Its ability to capture infrared light allows us to see structures and phenomena that other telescopes can’t detect, like this galactic collision that might hold the key to one of the biggest astrophysical mysteries. How much more is still hidden up there?!",

        "content": "A simulated view from the surface of Europa, one of Jupiter's four Galilean moons.\n\nNew observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are painting a new picture of Jupiter's moon Europa and revealing the hidden chemistry of the icy moon's interior.\n\nFor decades, scientists pictured Europa's frozen surface as a still, silent shell. But the new observations reveal that it's actually a dynamic world that's far from frozen in time.\n\n\"We think that the surface is fairly porous and warm enough in some areas to allow the ice to recrystallize rapidly,\" Richard Cartwright, a spectroscopist at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory and lead author of the new study, said in a statement.\n\nPerhaps even more exciting is what this surface activity reveals about Europa's subsurface ocean. The presence of geologic activity and ongoing cycling between the subsurface and surface make \"chaos terrains\" — highly disrupted regions where blocks of ice seem to have broken off, drifted and refrozen — especially valuable as potential windows into Europa's interior.\n\nThe study focused on two regions in Europa's southern hemisphere: Tara Regio and Powys Regio. Tara Regio, in particular, stands out as one of the moon's most intriguing areas. Observations from JWST detected crystalline ice both at the surface and deeper below — challenging previous assumptions about how ice is distributed on Europa.\n\nRelated: Explore Jupiter's icy ocean moon Europa in NASA virtual tour (photos)\n\nBy measuring the spectral properties of these \"chaos\" regions using remotely sensed data, scientists could gain valuable insight about Europa's chemistry as well as its potential for habitability, they explained in the paper, which was published May 28 in The Planetary Science Journal.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

Unlike on Earth, where ice naturally forms a hexagonal crystal structure, the intense radiation on Europa disrupts the ice's structure, causing it to become what's known as amorphous ice — a disordered, noncrystalline form.\n\nThe experiments played a crucial role in demonstrating how the ice changes over time. By studying how the ice transforms between different states, scientists can learn more about the moon's surface dynamics. When combined with fresh data from JWST, these findings add to a growing body of evidence showing that a vast, hidden liquid ocean lies beneath Europa's icy shell.\n\n\"In this same region […] we see a lot of other unusual things, including the best evidence for sodium chloride, like table salt, probably originating from its interior ocean,\" Cartwright said. \"We also see some of the strongest evidence for CO 2 and hydrogen peroxide on Europa. The chemistry in this location is really strange and exciting.\"\n\nThese regions, marked by fractured surface features, may point to geologic activity pushing material up from beneath Europa's icy shell.\n\nNASA's Jupiter-observing mission Juno has taken its closest to date image of the gas giant's mysterious ice-covered moon Europa. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI)\n\nJWST's NIRSpec instrument is especially well suited for studying Europa's surface because it can detect key chemical signatures across a wide range of infrared wavelengths. This includes features associated with crystalline water ice and a specific form of carbon dioxide called ¹³CO₂, which are important for understanding the moon's geologic and chemical processes.\n\nNIRSpec can measure these features all at once while also creating detailed maps that show how these materials are distributed across Europa's surface. Its high sensitivity and ability to collect both spectral and spatial data make it an ideal tool for uncovering clues about what lies beneath Europa's icy crust.\n\nThe team detected higher levels of carbon dioxide in these areas than in surrounding regions. They concluded that it likely originates from the subsurface ocean rather than from external sources like meteorites, which would have resulted in a more even distribution.\n\nMoreover, carbon dioxide is unstable under Europa's intense radiation environment, suggesting that these deposits are relatively recent and tied to ongoing geological processes. \"The evidence for a liquid ocean underneath Europa's icy shell is mounting, which makes this so exciting as we continue to learn more,\" Raut said.\n\nAnother intriguing finding was the presence of carbon-13, an isotope of carbon. \"Where is this 13CO 2 coming from? It's hard to explain, but every road leads back to an internal origin, which is in line with other hypotheses about the origin of 12CO 2 detected in Tara Regio,\" Cartwright said.\n\nThis study arrives as NASA's Europa Clipper mission is currently en route to the Jovian moon, with an expected arrival in April 2030. The spacecraft will perform dozens of flybys, with each one bringing it closer to Europa's surface to gather critical data about the ocean hidden beneath the moon's icy crust.",

        "content": "NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured evidence of a planet beyond the solar system for the first time since its launch in 2021.\n\nThe exoplanet, a planet beyond our solar system, has been dubbed TWA 7b and orbits the young nearby star TWA 7, NASA said. Scientists believe the exoplanet is around the mass of Saturn and is about 50 times the distance of Earth from the sun, according to NASA.\n\nUsually, planets of this size outside our solar system are difficult to detect, but scientists used a technique called high-contrast imaging to detect the exoplanet, NASA said. Images of the exoplanet were taken using a coronagraph, which allows researchers to suppress the bright glare of a star to reveal faint nearby objects.\n\nAstronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have captured compelling evidence of a planet with a mass similar to Saturn orbiting the young nearby star TWA 7. Space Telescope Science Institute\n\nScientists said there was a very small chance the images could show a background galaxy, but evidence \"strongly points to the source being a previously undiscovered planet.\"\n\n\"Our observations reveal a strong candidate for a planet shaping the structure of the TWA 7 debris disk, and its position is exactly where we expected to find a planet of this mass,\" lead researcher Anne-Marie Lagrange said.\n\nThe exoplanet could be a young and cold planet with a mass approximately 0.3 times that of Jupiter and a temperature of around 120 degrees Fahrenheit, according to initial analysis by researchers.\n\nThe first time scientists discovered an exoplanet was back in 1992. Astronomers have discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets since then, but none of them are known to be habitable.",

The telescope, part of the Virtual Telescope project, spotted Webb at about 1.5 times the moon-Earth distance. Although it's not visible in this image, the telescope was just extending its deployable tower assembly (DTA), a 48-inch-long (1.2 meters) shaft that connects the telescope's two halves, NASA officials said in a statement.\n\nThe DTA creates necessary space between the part of the telescope that houses its enormous mirror and scientific instruments and the spacecraft bus, which houses its electronics and propulsion systems.\n\nThe image, taken in a single 120-second exposure, shows the tennis court-sized observatory as a small dot in the middle, marked by an arrow.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

The telescope is now heading to the Lagrangian point 2 (L2), a point on the sun-Earth axis behind the planet, where the gravitational forces of the two bodies will allow it to remain in a stable position. The telescope will reach L2, some 930,000 miles (1,5 million km) away from Earth, by the end of January. Due to its size, the telescope had to be folded for launch and is now building itself like an origami during its journey. – Tereza Pultarova\n\nThe darkness of Alaskan winter\n\n(Image credit: NOAA)\n\nWednesday: December 29, 2021: A timelapse video showing the passage of 2.5 late December days in Alaska with the northern parts of the state submerged in continuous darkness.\n\nThe timeless, captured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) GOES West satellite, shows how little sunlight the northernmost U.S. state receives in winter.

The anticipated lift-off is expected to take place at 7:20 a.m. EST (1220 GMT). The telescope will then commence its one-month journey to the Lagrangian Point 2, a point on the sun-Earth axis hidden behind the planet, where the gravity of the two bodies will keep it in a stable position. During this journey, the telescope will gradually unfold its sunshield, mirrors and solar arrays in a complex and never before executed deployment procedure. – Tereza Pultarova\n\nSeeing underneath the surface of Jupiter's moons\n\n(Image credit: ESA)\n\nThursday: December 23, 2021: A novel radar instrument that will enable scientists to peer 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) below the surface of Jupiter's moons has been tested ahead of the 2023 launch of a new Jupiter exploring mission.\n\nThe Radar for Icy Moons Exploration (RIME) instrument will fly on the European Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer mission (Juice) that is expected to reach the largest planet of our solar system in 2031.\n\nIn this image, RIME is tested on a 1:18 scale model of the Juice spacecraft inside the European Space Agency's radiofrequency and antenna test chamber at the ESTEC center in the Netherlands.\n\nThe goal of the Juice mission is to search for signs of life on Jupiter's icy moons. – Tereza Pultarova\n\nThe spacewalker's view of the International Space Station\n\n(Image credit: NASA/Thomas Marshburn)\n\nWednesday: December 22, 2021: NASA astronaut Thomas Marshburn captured this image of the International Space Station during a space walk in early December.\n\nDuring the spacewalk, Marshburn and fellow NASA astronaut Kayla Barron replaced a faulty antenna and performed some maintenance around the orbital outpost.\n\nMarshburn shared this image on Twitter on Monday (Dec. 20), saying: \"Another view of the @Space_Station from 60 feet up during our spacewalk a couple of weeks ago.

Built to detect the first stars and galaxies that formed after the Big Bang, the telescope will also trace the evolving chemical composition of the universe, analyze atmospheres of exoplanets and look into the outer fringes of the solar system in unprecedented detail. – Tereza Pultarova\n\nJapanese billionaire lands after a 12-day space trip\n\n(Image credit: Roscosmos)\n\nMonday: December 20, 2021: Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa shortly after the landing of a Soyuz capsule that brought him and his assistant back to Earth after 12 days at the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nMaezawa and assistant/videographer Yozo Hirano were the first space tourists visiting the orbital outpost since the 2009 trip of Canadian businessman Guy Laliberté. The two arrived at the ISS accompanied by Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin who also commanded their return trip. The three space travellers landed on Sunday (Dec 19) 10:13 p.m. EST (0313 GMT or 9:13 a.m. local time on Dec. 20) on the steppe of Kazakhstan, southeast of the town of Dzhezkazgan.\n\nMaezawa, 46, is the CEO of Start Today and founder of ZOZO, an online retail clothing business, which he sold to Yahoo! Japan. In 2018, he paid an undisclosed but substantial amount to SpaceX for a circumlunar flight on the company's still-in-development Starship spacecraft. Maezawa's \"dearMoon\" mission, which will fly him and a crew of artists around the moon, is currently targeted for launch in 2023. – Tereza Pultarova\n\nEurope's spaceport readies for James Webb Space Telescope launch\n\n(Image credit: Copernicus)\n\nFriday: December 17, 2021: The European Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, where preparations for the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope are in full swing, captured by the European Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission.\n\nThe spaceport will send off Webb, the most complex and expensive astronomical observatory ever flown in space, hopefully on Friday, Dec. 24. The launch has recently been delayed because of a faulty data cable that slowed down the final health checks of the spacecraft before its encapsulation into the rocket fairing.\n\nKourou is located some 40 miles (60 kilometers) from French Guiana's capital Cayenne. The town's position close to the equator is ideal for a spaceport, as the rotation of Earth gives every rocket an extra nudge. – Tereza Pultarova\n\nFind an astronaut\n\n(Image credit: NASA)\n\nThursday: December 16, 2021: It is not known what the clutter in this picture is, but these are the legs of NASA astronaut Raja Chari sticking out from the middle of it all.\n\nChari, who arrived at the orbital outpost on Nov. 11 as part of SpaceX Crew-3, posted the picture on his Twitter account with a few others on Wednesday (Dec. 15).\n\n\"Daily life on @Space_Station always changes for @NASA_Astronauts⁠ — got to do plant gene science, dive into a giant space closet, and try to keep my heart & legs healthy all in one day,\" he said.\n\nWe assume this picture is that of the giant space closet. –Tereza Pultarova\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope mounted on its rocket\n\n(Image credit: ESA)\n\nWednesday: December 15, 2021: The James Webb Space Telescope has been placed on top of the Ariane 5 rocket ahead of its launch next week from the European Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.\n\nWhile the telescope is being attached to the launch vehicle adaptor, the rest of the rocket is hidden under the engineering platform.

In years when the shower coincides with the new moon, skywatchers in dark locations can spot up to 150 meteors per hour. The 2021 peak on Dec. 13, however, took place just a few days before the full moon. The bright moonlight therefore outshined many of the fainter meteorites.\n\nStill, the image obtained by Xue Bing is spectacular, showing dozens of trails of various brightness levels. -- Tereza Pultarova\n\nSatellites capture trail of devastation left by Kentucky twister\n\n(Image credit: Copernicus)\n\nMonday: December 13, 2021: The trail of devastation left by a powerful tornado that ripped through the town of Mayfield in Kentucky over the weekend has been captured by Europe's Sentinel 2 Earth-observing satellite.\n\nThe two images in the mosaic above show Mayfield on Dec. 11, just after the disaster struck.\n\nMayfield wasn't the only town hit by the forceful natural phenomenon over the past weekend. Weather experts had estimated that more than 40 tornadoes stormed through nine U.S. states in the past days.\n\nAuthorities are still assessing the damage. In Kentucky alone, the tornadoes are believed to have killed at least 50 people. -- Tereza Pultarova\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope moved for rocket integration\n\n(Image credit: ESA)\n\nFriday: December 10, 2021: The James Webb Space Telescope has been transferred to the final assembly building at Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, where it will be mounted on top of the Ariane 5 rocket ahead of its Dec. 22 launch.\n\nThe precious telescope that cost $10 billion and took more than 30 years to build, was placed into a protective 23-ton container during its final short trip before the beginning of its space journey.\n\nThe 6.2 metric ton telescope will now be lifted onto an elevated platform for encapsulation into the rocket fairing, which had to be adapted to accommodate the giant space explorer.\n\nWebb, the largest and most powerful space telescope ever built, will peer into the most distant corners of the universe, promising to detect the earliest stars and galaxies that formed after the Big Bang. The telescope is expected to generate ground-breaking discoveries that will revolutionize our understanding of the universe's early years and its evolution. It will also provide an unprecedented window into star formation and chemical composition of planets around distant stars. -- Tereza Pultarova\n\nSpace station crew poses for family portrait with Japanese space tourists\n\n(Image credit: Roscosmos)\n\nThursday: December 9, 2021: Astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station welcomed Japanese space tourists, billionaire Yusaku Maezawa and his assistant Yozo Hirano, who arrived accompanied by cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin.\n\nThe latest arrival expanded the current crew of the space station to ten members. The crew posed for this family portrait on Wednesday (Dec. 8) shortly after the arrival of the Soyuz capsule that brought Maezawa, Hirano and Misurkin to the station.\n\nThe two tourists plan to spend their twelve days on the orbital outpost filming videos and going through a \"bucket list\" of things to do in space.\n\nThey will return to Earth, accompanied by Misurkin, on Dec. 20. -- Tereza Pultarova\n\nJapanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa heads for space station\n\n(Image credit: Roscosmos)\n\nWednesday: December 8, 2021: Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa tucked inside Russia's Soyuz spacecraft heading for a nearly two-week trip at the International Space Station.\n\nMaezawa, who launched to the orbital outpost from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome on Wednesday 2:38 a.m. EST (0738 GMT or 12:38 p.m. local time), is the first space tourist to visit the orbital outpost since 2009.\n\nHe is accompanied by his assistant Yozo Hirano, who will film the entire experience. With them inside the Soyuz capsule was the flight's commander Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin.\n\nMaezawa, a life-long space enthusiast, is also expected to fly to the moon with SpaceX's dearMoon mission, currently scheduled for 2023. -- Tereza Pultarova\n\n'Space suits' protect James Webb technicians from toxic fuels\n\n(Image credit: ESA)\n\nTuesday: December 7, 2021: Engineers fuelling the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) wear protective 'space suits' to avoid poisoning by toxic chemicals that will help keep the precious spacecraft stable in space.\n\nThe engineers took ten days to fill the telescope's propellant tanks with 79.5 liters of dinitrogen tetroxide oxidiser and 159 liters of hydrazine. The operation was completed on Dec. 3, more than two weeks ahead of the mission's Dec. 22 launch.\n\nAs both, hydrazine and dinitrogen tetroxide, are extremely toxic, only a few trained specialists wearing protective suits resembling spacewalking attire were allowed into the fuelling hall.\n\nThe engineers will next place the 6,2 metric ton JWST inside a protective rocket fairing that will be mounted on top of the Ariane 5 launch vehicle prior to the transfer of the combo for final assembly. -- Tereza Pultarova\n\nSatellites observe as climate change speeds up Antarctic current\n\n(Image credit: Copernicus)\n\nMonday: December 6, 2021: Satellite data reveal the climate change-related speeding up of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.\n\nThe current, which circles the icy continent from west to east, is the largest ocean current on the planet and the dominant feature influencing the Southern Ocean. In recent years, scientists have noticed the current is speeding up due to the progressing climate change.\n\nSome experts worry the acceleration of the powerful current might further speed up climate change as it could decrease the capacity of the Southern Ocean to absorb carbon dioxide, the dominant greenhouse gas, from the atmosphere.\n\nThis image, based on data from the European Copernicus Earth-observation program, shows the ocean flow around the south-pole ice cap on Dec.3. -- Tereza Pultarova\n\nMars rover shows off its sand escape skills\n\n(Image credit: Thales Alenia Space)\n\nFriday: December 3, 2021: The ExoMars rover tested its ability to escape from sand in a recent test at an Italian 'training center' where it practices for its upcoming mission.\n\nThe test model of the joint European/Russian rover, which will set out for its trip to the red planet next year, used its wheel-walking mode that was designed by engineers specifically to help the rover get unstuck in sandy terrain.\n\nSeveral Martian rovers in the past struggled to free themselves from sand dunes, with their wheels digging them deeper just like a car stuck in mud or snow.\n\nTeams developing the ExoMars Rosalind Franklin rover, which will search for traces of life underneath the surface of Mars, have therefore developed the wheel-walking locomotion mode, which uses individual wheels like legs. In the test, it took Rosalind Franklin two minutes to cross the 6.6 feet (2 meters) wide sand trap. -- Tereza Pultarova\n\nAstronauts suiting up for spacewalk\n\n(Image credit: ESA/Matthias Maurer)\n\nThursday: December 2, 2021: NASA astronauts Kayla Barron and Thomas Marshburn are suiting up for a Thursday (Dec. 2) spacewalk in an image captured by their colleague Matthias Maurer.\n\nDuring the more than six hour spacewalk, which was postponed because of space debris risk, the two astronauts replaced a faulty antenna on the space station's truss. For Barron, who is on her first space mission, this was also the first spacewalk. Mashburn, on the other hand, is a seasoned astronaut and an experienced spacewalker who has worked outside the space station multiple times since his first spaceflight in 2009.\n\nThe two spacewalkers arrived at the orbital outpost with SpaceX's Crew-3 mission on Nov. 11 together with Raja Chari, also of NASA, and European astronaut Matthias Maurer. It was Maurer who shared the image of the spacewalk preparations on his Twitter account. -- Tereza Pultarova\n\nPieces of an asteroid on a trans-Pacific trip\n\n(Image credit: JAXA)\n\nWednesday: December 1, 2021: Precious extra-terrestrial samples delivered to Earth by a Japanese space probe last year crossed the Pacific Ocean, travelling incognito locked in unassuming black containers.\n\nScientists from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) accompanied pieces of asteroid Ryugu on their journey from Japan to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.\n\nAnalyses of the asteroid bits will continue in laboratories in Japan and around the world, JAXA said in a statement.\n\nRyugu is a 0.6 mile-wide (1 kilometer) asteroid that scientists consider a potential threat to Earth. In 2018, Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa2 visited the asteroid, spending a year and a half studying its surface and structure. During its mission, the spacecraft collected three samples of material from the surface and near subsurface of the asteroid, which successfully arrived at Earth in December 2020. -- Tereza Pultarova\n\nCan't find the date you're looking for?

        "content": "This Christmas morning, we witnessed history in the making. The James Webb Space Telescope -- a multi-billion dollar, gold-plated and unimaginably precise piece of machinery -- successfully blasted off from South America, beginning its legendary trip among the stars.\n\nAt 4:20 a.m. PT (9:20 a.m. local time in French Guiana), Webb's launch window opened. The telescope promptly lifted off, marking the realization of NASA's decades-long endeavor to pierce through the universe's invisibility cloak and reveal massive secrets about the cosmos. Twenty years since a brilliant crew of engineers first started working on the telescope, here we are on a date worthy of astronomy textbooks yet to be written.\n\nThe largest, most powerful telescope ever built by the agency is poised to harness the strength of infrared imaging to detect wavelengths emanating from stars and galaxies unseeable by human eyes, many of which were formed right after the Big Bang when the universe was born. Scientists believe it can lead the search for habitable exoplanets, work with the Event Horizon Telescope to help decode elusive black holes, and, one day, even tell us whether we are alone in the cosmos.\n\nKeep up to date with the launch info and updates below, on NASA TV or on NASA's Webb stream on YouTube.

        "content": "The long-awaited James Webb Space Telescope is ushering in a new era of space observation.\n\nWith its tennis court-sized sunshield and 6.5m primary mirror flat-packed inside the launcher like a ship in a bottle, the James Webb Space Telescope is a formidable observing instrument.\n\nUnlike ground-based telescopes and observatories, Webb is a 'space telescope', meaning it operates in space, where it gets a clearer view of the Universe.\n\nSee the latest James Webb Space Telescope images\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope NIRCam image of the Serpens Nebula. Red streaks in the top left are shockwaves caused by jets from young stars colliding with cosmic gas and dust. Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, K. Pontoppidan (NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory), J. Green (Space Telescope Science Institute)\n\nIt observes in infrared, meaning it can see things the human eye can't see, enabling astronomers to get a unique view of the cosmos and unlock many of its mysteries.\n\nWebb is helping astronomers learn more about galaxies, galaxy clusters, nebulae, exoplanets and the very early Universe.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has, in a sense, picked up the observing baton from previous missions like the Kepler Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope and, of course, the incredible Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope is giving astronomers a new look at familiar objects like the Crab Nebula. Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Tea Temim (Princeton University)\n\nLaunch and journey to space\n\nOnce launched, JWST travelled over 1.5 million km to a gravitationally stable outpost called Lagrange 2 (L2).\n\nThis lies on a straight line from the Sun to Earth and beyond, so JWST is locked into Earth’s yearly orbit around the Sun.\n\nIn this image captured by cameras on the upper stage of its Ariane 5 rocket, JWST sets off on its 1.5 million km voyage to L2 after separating on 25 December 2021. Credit: Arianespace/ESA/NASA/CSA/CNES\n\nA total of three mid-course correction manoeuvres successfully placed the huge space telescope in a slow looping orbit around the second Lagrange point, 1.5 million kilometres behind Earth as seen from the Sun.\n\nThe telescope and its sensitive instruments, which left the French Guiana launch platform at tropical temperatures, had to cool down to 230˚C below zero before science operations could begin.\n\nWebb orbits the L2 point, keeping the Sun, Earth and Moon behind it for a clear view of deep space.\n\nThanks to its giant multi-layer sunshield, JWST had already reached –200 °C by early January 2022, but the passive cooling slows down over time.\n\nIt’s a delicate process. The optics can never be the coldest parts of the telescope, lest molecules released as gases from the graphite-composite support structure freeze down on the mirrors, degrading its performance.\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope's iconic hexagonal mirror pictured in a cleanroom at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, US. Credit: NASA/Chris Gunn\n\nWhen the NIRCam instrument (Near Infrared Camera) got cold enough for its sensitive mercury-cadmium-telluride detectors to pick up infrared light, the process of aligning the telescope’s 18 mirror segments could finally commence.\n\nEach of the Webb Telescope's hexagonal segments is fitted with seven actuators and can be slightly tilted, shifted, rotated and deformed to ensure they operate together as one perfect parabolic surface.\n\nThe hexagonal mirror is what contributes to the 8 diffraction spikes seen around stars in Webb images.\n\nArtist's impression of the James Webb Space Telescope.

Beckwith (STScI) and the HUDF Team, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems / STScI / ATG medialab\n\nTesting Webb's instruments\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope has four large science instruments:\n\nNIRCam (Near InfraRed Camera)\n\nNIRSpec (Near InfraRed Spectrometer)\n\nMIRI (Mid InfraRed Instrument\n\nFGS/NIRISS (Fine Guidance Sensor/Near InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph).\n\nEquipped with beam splitters, filters and micro-shutters, all have different observing modes, and these had to be fully tested and calibrated before they were handed over to the astronomy community.\n\nMIRI (left) being integrated into JWST’s science payload module at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in 2013. Credit: NASA/C. Gunn\n\nAstronomers waited a long time to train their new, expensive toy on their favourite objects, be that a remote galaxy at the dawn of time, a planet-spawning accretion disk, an exoplanet’s atmosphere or a denizen of our own outer Solar System.\n\nYet the James Webb Space Telescope has less pointing flexibility than the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nSince the telescope must face away from the Sun to keep its instruments consistently cool, its ‘field of regard’ covers 40% of the sky on any given day.\n\nJWST’s mid-course corrections used up less fuel than expected, which means there’s more left to keep the space telescope in its L2 orbit.\n\nAs a result, its operational lifetime may be extended beyond the projected operational period of 10 years.\n\nHow the James Webb Space Telescope unfolded in space\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope's 10 stages of deployment. Credit: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nIt took more than 50 individual steps and two weeks to for JWST to reach its orbital point and become fully deployed.\n\nHere's a timeline of how it all took place.\n\n25 December 2021, 12:20 UT:JWST launches from the Guiana Space Centre on an Ariane 5 rocket; after 27 minutes, it separates from the launcher’s upper stage to travel to L2 alone. 25 December 2021, 12:48 UT Deployment of JWST’s 6m, five-panel solar array, which delivers about 1Kw of power. The telescope can now switch from battery power to its own power. 26 December 2021: Deployment of the high-gain communications antenna, which allows communication with Earth through NASA’s Deep Space Network. 28 December 2021: The Forward Unitized Pallet Structure (UPS), which supports and contains the five folded layers forming the front half of the sunshield, is lowered into place. 29 December 2021: The Deployable Tower Assembly (DTA) is raised by 1.2m for better thermal isolation and to give room for the sunshield to unfold in front and behind. 30–31 December 2021: Sunshield mid-booms are extended on either side, pulling the folded sunshield layers with them, to form the first part of its distinctive 21m x 14m kite shape. 3–4 January 2022: The five Kapton layers of Webb’s sunshield are tensioned. While the Sun-facing side endures temperatures up to 90°C, the shielded side will be as cold as –230°C. 5 January 2022:JWST’s 74cm convex secondary mirror is deployed. The foldable structure supporting it has been dubbed “the world’s most sophisticated tripod”. 6 January 2022: Deployment of the 1.2m x 2.4m Aft Deployable Instrument Radiator (ADIR), which radiates heat from the space telescope’s science instruments into space. 7–8 January 2022: Deployment of the two side panels forming JWST’s 6.5m primary mirror. Its 18 hexagonal segments are made of lightweight beryllium coated with pure gold.\n\nWhat is James Webb Space Telescope doing?\n\nJWST will be able to see a much wider portion of the spectrum than Hubble\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope - unlike Hubble, which orbits Earth, going in and out of our shadow every 90 minutes - has unobstructed views of the Universe.\n\nHowever, the telescope’s far-flung location also means that, unlike Hubble, it cannot be reached after launch and so missions similar to the Hubble servicing missions are impossible.\n\nJWST is hovering at L2 for the next 5.5 to 10 years, and scientists are already finding it is giving us glimpses of the early Universe that we have never seen before.\n\nIt is one of the largest, most powerful telescopes and is giving us new insights into every phase of the Universe’s history, from the first dust clouds to our Solar System’s formation.\n\nA view of Uranus, its rings and moons captured by the NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) on the James Webb Space Telescope.

Credit: NASA\n\nHow will the James Webb Space Telescope build on Hubble’s legacy?\n\nHubble, as amazing as it has been over its 30-year lifetime, has told us there are some things that we would need a different facility to answer.\n\nHubble in some sense has set up the scientific successor questions that Webb is designed to answer, and the reason Hubble couldn't, say, finish some of the investigations or complete them is because it's got a primary mirror of a given size and its wavelength region is primarily visible.\n\nOne of the areas in particular that Hubble pointed us to was the need for a larger infrared telescope to find some of the earliest galaxies.\n\nSo Hubble enabled us to know how to build its successor.\n\nWill JWST be able to look back in time at the earliest galaxies?\n\nThat's right. Because of the finite speed of light and the very vast distances of space, when we see light from these earliest galaxies, that light left a long time ago on its journey to our telescopes.\n\nSo we are seeing back in time to when the Universe was young. Even though these galaxies are very distant, they're actually young when we're observing them and their light has been red shifted by the expansion of the Universe.\n\nThe light left those very young galaxies as ultraviolet and visible light, but the expansion of the Universe has stretched its wavelengths into the infrared. And that's why we optimised Webb to work there.\n\nEngineers clean a test telescope mirror for the James Webb Space Telescope by blasting carbon dioxide snow at it. This technique helps to avoid scratching the delicate surface. Credit: NASA/Chris Gunn\n\nCould we actually see the Big Bang happening?\n\nWith Hubble, we can look back to see some of the young galaxies when the Universe was about 500 million years old.\n\nWe use microwave background experiments like WMAP or the Planck mission to see the cosmic microwave background, the so-called surface of last scattering, which is when the Universe is three hundred thousand years old.\n\nSo in between three hundred thousand and five hundred million years, we don't know what the Universe is doing.It's that period of time we're building Webb to look at.\n\nWhen did those early galaxies first form? Was it at 200 million years? 300 million years? That's the question.\n\nHow was the James Webb Space Telescope built?\n\nThe first thing we knew we needed to do was to have JWST work in the infrared.\n\nYou know where galaxies emit most of the light and you know how far the Universe has stretched that light, so that tells you what wavelengths you want to optimise for.\n\nFor us, that's wavelengths from just a little bit redder than the eye can see out to about 10 to 20 microns. So that tells you your wavelength range.\n\nNow, because these objects are very faint, we know we need a bigger mirror and you can estimate the size of the mirror you need.\n\nOnce you know those two things, the rest of the design follows. The interesting thing for us is that our mirror is so big we can't fit it into a rocket when the mirror is just one piece.\n\nSo we had to make a telescope that folds up, and it's that feature of Webb that makes it so interesting and its shape so iconic.\n\nTwo JWST primary mirror segments are slotted onto their support structure. Credit: NASA/Chris Gunn\n\nAre space telescopes similar to regular telescopes?\n\nYes. The JWST is a reflecting telescope. It works just the same as the telescopes you buy and use here on Earth.\n\nIt looks a little different because we don't have a tube around Webb. Rather, we have a sun shield, which you can almost imagine is like a parasol.\n\nIt sits on the side of the observatory that faces infrared bright sources, which for us are the Sun, Earth and the Moon, and then the telescope looks out more or less parallel to that parasol.\n\nWe don't need a tube, and the tube itself would have been extra mass that would have made the launch more difficult.\n\nInstead we have this so-called naked mirror and it feeds four different science instruments, cameras and spectrographs.\n\nWhere will JWST be located and what will its orbit be like?\n\nWebb needs to be very far away from infrared sources of light or heat. And of course, Hubble being only about 300km above Earth is too close to an infrared source.\n\nSo we're going to position Webb about 1.5 million kilometres from Earth at the so-called L2 or second Lagrange point.\n\nThese are positions in any two-body orbiting system and were discovered in the late 1700s by a French Italian mathematician, Josephy-Louis Lagrange.\n\nIf you put the telescope one and a half million kilometres away, it's far from infrared sources, so you're not blinded by this infrared light locally and you can keep all of them again to one side of you.\n\nThis means you only need a sun shield and you don't need a tube.\n\nWebb will follow Earth in its orbit around the Sun: it doesn't orbit Earth, it orbits the Sun.\n\nAn illustration showing the Hubble Space Telescope's orbit around Earth. Credit: NASA & ESA\n\nHow will JWST be safe from high temperature or space debris?\n\nTemperature wise, it's much more benign to be at L2.\n\nWhen it orbits Earth, JWST goes in and out of Earth's shadow, so its exposed to the Sun, then it’s not exposed to the Sun, then it’s exposed to the Sun again. It experiences temperature gradients because of that.\n\nBut out at L2 its temperature is much more stable. So that's easier in some sense for us than an Earth-orbiting telescope.\n\nHowever, it’s not protected by Earth's magnetic fields, and so it’s a little more exposed to cosmic radiation out there.\n\nIn terms of micrometeoroids, we more or less know and can calculate the expected number of micrometeoroids of a given size that will hit the telescope over a lifetime.\n\nWhen we were designing Webb, we knew we had to build in enough capability early on in the mission so that by the end of the mission lifetime, we were still able to do our science.\n\nYou more or less build it a little better than you need at the start so that by the time you've taken into account any micrometeoroids, you're still able to do your science.\n\nIs it dangerous that Webb can't be serviced like Hubble?\n\nIt's important to remember that while everyone knows about the Hubble servicing missions, there really is only one satellite that was ever built to be serviced, and that's Hubble.\n\nAll other satellites are built assuming you will never service them, and the same is the case with Webb, primarily because we're so far away.\n\nWe don't have the ability to send astronauts out that far today and we don't have a robot that could do the repairs, so we have to build redundancy in to the design of Webb.\n\nWe make sure that in the case of motors that have to deploy things, we have more than one way to address them electrically.\n\nThis goes for all other satellites other than Hubble. We don't build in the assumption we'll service it.\n\nWe make sure that we test it on the ground to verify it works and build in redundancy so that we don't need to.\n\nAstronauts Michael Good and Michael Massimino pictured during the final Hubble servicing mission. Credit: NASA\n\nIf we launched Hubble with technology that we have now, would things be different?\n\nAt the time, this notion of a telescope and servicing were intimately linked. In some sense, the Space Shuttle and Hubble pulled each other along as they were being developed.\n\nThere's always a debate whether it would have been cheaper to just build another Hubble rather than service it and that's interesting speculation. I don't know what the ultimate answer is.\n\nI think today we know our technology is advanced enough that we don't necessarily need to build in this serviceability. Rather, we can build the smarts into the device itself.\n\nAnd Webb is a little bit down that path, but today you can build even more smarts into your spacecraft. You could imagine someday even self-healing spacecraft, for example.\n\nDo you mean artificial intelligence that would enable the telescope to fix itself?\n\nYou could imagine that in the software, but I'm even thinking, speculating farther out, about materials that could heal themselves.\n\nIn other words, it could recognise that it has a micrometeoroid impact and that it needs to repair itself where that happened.\n\nIt's much easier to do that on structures that aren't optics. I think self-healing optics is probably a little bit farther down the road.\n\nIs this something that NASA is looking into?\n\nI don't know of any current research programs that are specifically looking at that, but NASA does have an organisation called NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts, which tends to look at really far out ideas like that, just to ask whether there is anything really plausible in that field\n\nAnd people are incredibly clever, so even though now it sounds like science fiction, someday that will be science fact.\n\nThe ring superimposed on this Hubble image is a representation of the dark matter thought to be causing the distortions in a galaxy cluster.

And when Webb was actually started, we knew of exactly 2 exoplanets at that time.\n\nBut now of course there are thousands and we know of dozens that are Earth-like and nearby enough that Webb will be used to look at their atmospheres using the transit spectroscopy method.\n\nThis is when we observe as an exoplanet passes between us and its host star and we measure a spectrum of the star light with the planet in front of it, and then when the planet is not in front of it.\n\nYou can use this method to tell what's in the atmosphere of that planet, if it has an atmosphere.\n\nWe will be looking for things like water and methane and other kinds of chemicals that could indicate habitability for those exoplanets.\n\nThat's something we already know that people are proposing to do with Webb because it's an infra-red telescope.\n\nIt also is going to be used to look inside cosmic dust clouds where stars are forming in our own Galaxy, like in the Orion Nebula.\n\nInfrared light penetrates these clouds of dust that block visible light, and so we know there are going to be programs to study the births of stars in these clouds.\n\nFinally, because we can see more or less the full history of galaxy formation, we can watch the Universe assemble galaxies across cosmic time, which means you get the full family picture, from the baby pictures to the grandparent pictures.\n\nWill JWST solve the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter?\n\nIn the case of dark energy, astronomers will probably be using or they'll propose to use Webb to help us get better a measure of the Hubble constant.\n\nRight now there's a controversy between the Hubble constant measured through microwave background and through supernova studies.\n\nSo people will use Webb to help answer or address that discrepancy.\n\nIn the case of dark matter it will again be looking at many galaxies across cosmic time and looking at their rotation curves to see how much dark matter they would contain, and whether that tells us anything different from what we know from just doing visible light studies.\n\nHubble's famous 1995 image the 'Pillars of Creation'. Credit: NASA, ESA, STScI, J. Hester and P. Scowen (Arizona State University)\n\nWill James Webb Space Telescope produce beautiful images?\n\nYes, we designed JWST to be diffraction limited at 2 microns, meaning that the pictures we take in the near infrared will look just as sharp as the Hubble pictures do.\n\nHubble was optimised for around half a micron. When you put them side by side, they'll be just as sharp.\n\nBut they'll be telling us about different aspects of physics because we’re looking at visible light in one instance and infrared light in another.\n\nIt's the same sharp detail, but looking at slightly different things. So it'll be fascinating.\n\nHow has coronavirus affected work on JWST?\n\nWell, it's certainly an interesting time for everyone in the in the world having to work from home in many cases.\n\nAt Northrup Grumman in Southern California, at their Space Park Facility where the hardware is right now, work is continuing on integration and testing, mindful of social distancing and other sorts of considerations we have to take into account. So they are progressing there.\n\nFolks at the Space Telescope Science Institute, the European Space Agency and Canadian Space Agency: a lot of them are working from home.\n\nAnd there's some work you can do from home, some software development and catching up on paperwork, the kind of things that you get behind with a little bit at the end of a mission.\n\nSo work is continuing, although not at the same pace as it as it would.\n\nOf course, we have to take the coronavirus effects into account, and once we come out of this at the other end we'll evaluate our schedule and see how things look.\n\nBut it's important to remember that work still is progressing right now. We are all here. A lot of us have been working for many years on it, and we're so close right now, so we're very excited.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the May 2020 and March 2022 issues of BBC Sky at Night Magazine",

        "content": "After spending 25 years in development, NASA and its partner organizations — the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) — finally sent the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) into space on Saturday.\n\nThe telescope, which will succeed the Hubble Space Telescope as NASA’s flagship astrophysics mission, rode to orbit on Arianespace‘s Ariane 5 ECA heavy lift two-stage rocket, which took off from Europe’s Guiana Space Center at 7:20 a.m. EST on Dec. 25. The launch itself was ESA’s main contribution to the JWST mission.\n\nNASA reported that ground teams began receiving telemetry data from Webb about five minutes after launch. The observatory separated from the Ariane 5 rocket 27 minutes into the flight, at an altitude of approximately 870 miles. Approximately 30 minutes after launch, Webb unfolded its solar array, and mission managers confirmed that the solar array was providing power to the observatory.\n\nOnce operational, JWST will provide provide enhanced observation capabilities allowing NASA and civil space agencies to view some of the most distant events and objects in the universe, including the formation of the first galaxies, in higher resolution than the Hubble Telescope.\n\n“The launch of the Webb Space Telescope is a pivotal moment – this is just the beginning for the Webb mission,” said Gregory Robinson, Webb’s program director at NASA Headquarters. “Now we will watch Webb’s highly anticipated and critical 29 days on the edge. When the spacecraft unfurls in space, Webb will undergo the most difficult and complex deployment sequence ever attempted in space. Once commissioning is complete, we will see awe-inspiring images that will capture our imagination.”\n\nIn an interview with Via Satellite’s On Orbit Podcast, world-renowned theoretical physicist Dr. Michio Kaku said JWST would, “change the way we think about life and the universe. We’ll have to rewrite most of the physics textbooks in existence.”\n\nDevelopment on JWST began all the way back in 1996 and its launch was originally planned to take place in 2007. Northrop Grumman was awarded the prime contract to build JWST. From the start, the JWST program was plagued by numerous budget, design, and construction issues that lead to delays and cost overruns and forced NASA to conduct a major redesign of the telescope in 2005.\n\nNASA further delayed the launch of JWST after the telescope’s sunshield ripped during a practice deployment in 2018. By June 2018, NASA estimated that the total deployment cost of JWST would be $8.8 billion.\n\nThe logistics challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic pushed the launch back further to 2022. The JWST launch was nearly pushed back into 2022 as issues arose during the spacecraft’s integration process with the Ariane 5 rocket.",

        "content": "An image of the interstellar invader Comet 3I/ATLAS as seen by Hubble\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope has caught its first glimpse of comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet is just the third object humanity has observed entering the solar system from beyond its limits.\n\nPrior to 3I/ATLAS, the previous two \"interstellar invaders\" were 1I/'Oumuamua, spotted in 2017, and 2I/Borisov, detected in 2019. Both have now left the solar system, though other interstellar bodies are predicted to dwell undetected in our cosmic backyard.\n\nAs Space.com reported on July 11, recent research suggested that 3I/ATLAS could be even more exciting than initially perceived, as its trajectory through the solar system indicates it comes from a region of the Milky Way older than our 4.6 billion-year-old solar system. With an estimated age of 7 billion years, that would make 3I/ATLAS the oldest comet we've ever seen.\n\nAstrophysics undergrad student astrafoxen alerted his followers to the Hubble images of 3I/ATLAS via this Bluesky feed.\n\n\"Hubble Space Telescope images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS are out! These were taken 5 hours ago. Plenty of cosmic rays peppering the images, but the comet's coma looks very nice and puffy.

Describing optical and near-infrared spectroscopy performed on 3I/ATLAS, the research reveals that: \"3I/ATLAS is an active interstellar comet containing abundant water ice, with a dust composition more similar to D-type asteroids than to ultrared trans-Neptunian objects.\"\n\nD-type asteroids are space rocks packed with organic molecule-rich silicates and carbon with water ice in their interiors.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

(Image credit: ESA)\n\nThe arrival of 3I/ATLAS into the solar system has initiated an exciting period for astronomers. Since the solar system interloper was spotted on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope, an array of other instruments have attempted to get in on the act by spotting the comet.\n\nOne project that will be trying to get a good look at 3I/ATLAS is the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which observes the universe near and far with the largest digital camera ever built. That is fitting, as the comet from beyond the solar system was actually first spotted as scientists were preparing to make observations with Rubin.\n\nThe new observatory, which released its first images of the cosmos on June 23, 2025, is expected to discover between 5 and 50 interstellar objects as they zip through the solar system during the observatory's decade-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).\n\nIn the meantime, 3I/ATLAS can enjoy the undivided attention of astronomers aiming to study interstellar bodies with a view to painting an intimate picture of planetary systems beyond our own.\n\nThe Hubble images of 3I/ATLAS are available to download from this database.",

        "content": "The James Webb Space Telescope’s dramatic unfolding is now complete. On Wednesday (January 19, 2022), engineers finished deploying the individual mirror segments. On Monday, ground teams plan to fire Webb’s thrusters, placing the telescope at its final destination, Lagrange point 2, or L2, some million miles (1.5 million km) away from Earth. NASA TV is scheduled to begin its coverage at mission control at 19 UTC (2 p.m. Eastern) on Monday. There’s also going to be a live event, where experts will be answering questions. That’ll begin at 20 UTC (3 p.m. Eastern) Monday.\n\nThe 2 p.m. Eastern broadcast will air live on NASA TV.\n\nThe 3 p.m. Eastern live online panel discussion will air on the NASA Science Live website, as well as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. Audio of the teleconference will stream live on the agency’s website.\n\nBefore this past month, space fans were jokingly referring to the month between Webb’s December 25 launch – and its January 24 placement at L2 – as 30 days of terror. That’s because, overall, Webb has 344 single-point failure items. About 80% of those items followed launch and were part of the deployment process. But wow! Things have gone smoothly so far. Webb’s engineers must be secretly breathing sighs of relief and feeling very proud! As they should. Webb is a marvelous machine.\n\nOnce Webb is safely at L2, the team will work on telescope alignment, with first images from the telescope due to arrive this summer.\n\nEarthSky lunar calendars are back in stock! We’re guaranteed to sell out – get one while you can.\n\nWe're gearing up to insert #NASAWebb into its orbit! What to expect on Jan. 24:\n\n? 3pm ET (20:00 UTC) NASA Science Live: Ask questions with #UnfoldTheUniverse ?\n\n? 4pm ET (21:00 UTC) Media teleconference with @NASAGoddard & @northropgrumman expertshttps://t.co/6MhQ60Mxzz pic.twitter.com/ReB8umJQLB — NASA Webb Telescope (@NASAWebb) January 20, 2022\n\nWhy L2, and where is it?\n\nSo, why is Webb going to a point so far away? Basically, this point in space – the second Lagrangian point – is where, in the Earth-sun system, gravitational forces and a body’s orbital motion balance each other. So, in effect, a spacecraft can “hover” relatively easily at L2. It can stay near Earth, while both Earth and the spacecraft orbit the sun. In fact, the European Space Agency (ESA) has called L2:\n\n… a preeminent location for advanced space probes.\n\nOther notable space observatories orbit, or will orbit, the sun at L2, including ESA’s redoubtable Gaia spacecraft, which has made so many fascinating discoveries about our Milky Way galaxy. And Gaia and Webb aren’t the only spacecraft at L2. Click here for a list of past, present and planned space probes at L2.\n\nKeeping Webb safe from the heat\n\nL2 has another advantage. It’s a step farther away from the heat of the sun and Earth. Satellites in Earth orbit – for example Hubble and the space station – undergo temperature changes about every 90 minutes, depending on whether the satellite is in shadow or sun. At L2, Webb won’t undergo this same temperature-shifting effect that would otherwise create distortions in the telescope’s ability to view the universe.\n\nWebb will observe primarily infrared light coming from faint and very distant objects. To be able to detect those faint signals, the telescope itself must be kept extremely cold: -370 F (about -220 C) or lower. That’s why Webb has a five-layer, tennis-court-sized sunshield, to protect the telescope from the heat of the sun and keep its instruments cold.\n\nBeing at L2, farther from the sun than the Earth or moon, will help, too.\n\nWebb’s unfolding, step by step\n\nWebb successfully launched on an Ariane 5 rocket on December 25, 2021. Next, it successfully deployed its solar array to stop draining battery power. It then successfully completed two mid-course correction burns. Then, Webb released its antenna. It lowered the forward and aft pallet structures that support the sunshield. On January 4, it completed the deployment and tensioning of all five layers of the sunshield.\n\nOn January 5, 2022, Webb’s team deployed the secondary mirror, the step that gave mission scientist Heidi Hammel the most trepidation. She’d been quoted earlier as saying:\n\nFor me, personally, that’s the scariest part of the whole deployment sequence, the secondary mirror … If we don’t have a secondary mirror, we don’t get any light from space into our cameras and spectrographs. There’s nothing.\n\nOn January 7, Webb unfolded the first of two primary mirror “wings.” On January 8, it unfolded the second mirror “wing,” concluding major deployments. Webb’s primary mirror is six times larger than Hubble’s. It’s made of 18 individual mirror segments, which were folded for launch. Now that they’ve been successfully deployed – and after Webb is safe at L2 – those 18 segments will all need to be recalibrated (aligned), which will take about 10 days.\n\nTen days of mirror alignment, followed by weeks of testing, are the reasons the telescope won’t be ready for scientific operations for about six months.\n\nEarlier NASA Webb Telescope tweet updates\n\nOn Twitter, NASA has been providing near real-time updates when Webb successfully completes steps of its mission. You can follow along what’s going on with the telescope, too, at NASA Webb Telescope.\n\n#NASAWebb is fully deployed! ? With the successful deployment & latching of our last mirror wing, that's:\n\n50 major deployments, complete.\n\n178 pins, released.\n\n20+ years of work, realized.

But Webb is an infrared telescope. The advantage of infrared is that Webb will be able to look farther into the universe than ever before. NASA gave a great visualization of the power of Webb to look into the past during a Q&A session on Reddit:\n\nImagine all of time, from the beginning of the universe until now, is represented on a year-long calendar. If right now is December 31 at 11:55 pm, Webb will be able to see all the way back to January 6th.\n\nNASA also explained why scientists want to see in the infrared and use spectroscopy. Spectroscopy allows astronomers to:\n\nunderstand what is there, not just how it looks.\n\nLooking deeper\n\nWhen a Reddit user asked if Webb was going to reproduce the famous Hubble Ultra Deep Field photo, NASA said:\n\nWebb will observe the Ultra Deep Field in our first year of science operations. It’ll take Webb less than a day to see deeper than Hubble saw in two weeks of staring. Webb is going to go much deeper, finding tens of thousand of galaxies that are too red and too faint for Hubble to detect.\n\nOf course, we’ve all been wowed and moved for decades by what the Hubble Space Telescope has shown us of the universe. Now, we expect to be further blown away by the images and revelations of Hubble’s successor, the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nBottom line: The James Webb Space Telescope has been unfolding its major components on its way to L2. After it’s safely in orbit, the telescope will undergo alignment in preparation for its science mission.\n\nVia Inverse\n\nVia ESA\n\nVia NASA",

        "content": "The James Webb Space Telescope captured a star-forming region in the Triangulum galaxy. New Webb results show that galaxies can suddenly “pause” their star formation, even in the very early universe.\n\nAstronomers have discovered over a dozen \"dormant\" galaxies that paused their star formation within the first billion years after the Big Bang .\n\nThe discovery, made with data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) , illuminates a fascinating phase in the lives of early galaxies and could provide more clues about how galaxies evolve.\n\nThere are several reasons why galaxies may stop forming new stars. One is the presence of supermassive black holes at their centers. These behemoths emit intense radiation that heats and depletes cold gas, the most important ingredient for star formation. Additionally, larger neighboring galaxies can strip away this cold gas or heat it, leading to a halt in star formation. As a result, these galaxies may remain dormant indefinitely, or become \" quenched .\"\n\nAnother reason galaxies become inactive is stellar feedback. That's when the gas in the galaxy gets warmed and expelled due to stellar processes like supernovas, intense stellar winds, or the pressure associated with starlight. The galaxy thus goes through a temporary \"quiet\" period.\n\n\"This is usually a temporary phase, which usually lasts about 25 million years,\" Alba Covelo Paz , a doctoral student at the University of Geneva and the lead author of a new study describing the findings, told Live Science in an email. Over millions of years, the gas that was pushed out falls back in, and the warm gas cools again. Once there is enough cold gas again, the galaxy can start forming new stars.\n\nWhile the dormant phase is commonly observed in nearby galaxies, astronomers have found only four dormant galaxies in the first billion years of the universe. Of those, three had masses below a billion solar masses and one had a mass above 10 billion solar masses. The limited observations and scattered properties of dormant galaxies were not sufficient to get a clear picture of early star formation.\n\nRelated: 'Previously unimaginable': James Webb telescope breaks its own record again, discovering farthest known galaxy in the universe\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

But why do some galaxies abruptly put star formation on pause? (Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI)\n\nTaking a breather\n\nResearchers didn't expect to see dormant galaxies in the early universe. Because these galaxies are young, they should be vigorously forming many new stars, astronomers thought. But in a 2024 paper , researchers described the first discovery of a dormant galaxy in the early universe.\n\n\"The first discovery of a dormant galaxy in the early universe was such a shock because that galaxy had been observed before with Hubble, but we could not know it was dormant until JWST,\" Paz said.\n\nThat's because, unlike the Hubble Space Telescope, JWST's NIRSpec instrument can both see light from these galaxies that has been redshifted to near-infrared wavelengths, and also provide spectroscopic details about it.\n\nAstronomers were curious to know why early galaxies stopped forming stars and whether this was common among a wide range of stellar masses. One hypothesis was that the galaxies had bursts of star formation and then quiet periods, before starting again. Paz and her team looked for the galaxies that were in between bursts of star formation. They used publicly available galaxy data in the DAWN JWST Archive .\n\nThey examined the light of about 1,600 galaxies, looking for signs of new stars not forming. They also focused on clear signatures of middle-aged or old stars in the galaxies' light. The team found 14 galaxies, ranging from about 40 million to 30 billion solar masses, that had paused star formation.\n\n\"We now found 14 sources supporting this burstiness process, and we found that all of them have halted star formation between 10 [million] and 25 million years before we observed them,\" Paz explained. That means these 14 galaxies were found to follow a stop-and-go fashion of star formation rather than continuously forming stars, and they have been quiet for at least 10 million to 25 million years.\n\nThis relatively short snooze hints that stellar feedback, such as supernovas or stellar winds, caused them to go quiet and that they may eventually restart their stellar factories, Paz said.\n\nHowever, there is still uncertainty, she added. \"We cannot confirm it for sure because we don't know how long they will remain dormant, and if they happen to stay dormant for another 50 million years, this would mean the cause of their quenching is different,\" Paz explained.\n\nThis scenario would suggest that the galaxies are dead. Nevertheless, the current properties of these galaxies support a cycle of fits and starts.\n\nBecause dormant galaxies are so rare, much about them remains mysterious. However, astronomers hope future observations will help shed light on these snoozing star factories. An upcoming JWST program called \"Sleeping Beauties\" will be dedicated to discovering dormant galaxies in the early universe, Paz said. This program will allow astronomers to estimate how long a galaxy remains in this quiet phase and help them understand the bursty star formation process.\n\n\"There are still many unknowns for us, but we are one step closer to unravelling this process,\" Paz said.",

        "content": "Astronomers may have captured a first-of-its-kind view of a supermassive black hole being born—an extraordinary event unfolding within a newly discovered celestial object dubbed the Infinity Galaxy.\n\nThe Infinity Galaxy, recently identified in the James Webb Space Telescope’s COSMOS-Web survey, was discovered by researchers from Yale University and the University of Copenhagen while reviewing archival mission data.\n\nNamed for its unusual shape, the Infinity Galaxy features two red nuclei, each situated within a ring, resulting in an appearance reminiscent of the infinity symbol, likely formed from the merger of two disk galaxies. Further observations have added new details, identifying a supermassive black hole within a gaseous region between the nuclei, as detailed in a new scientific paper.\n\nThe Infinity Galaxy\n\nImagery shows a wide expanse of ionized gas, with green splotches highlighting areas of hydrogen stripped of electrons. The central black hole, estimated to be one million times the mass of our Sun, most likely formed through the collapse of a gas cloud—a process known as “direct collapse.”\n\n“Everything is unusual about this galaxy. Not only does it look very strange, but it also has this supermassive black hole that’s pulling a lot of material in,” said lead author Pieter van Dokkum of Yale. “The biggest surprise of all was that the black hole was not located inside either of the two nuclei but in the middle. We asked ourselves: How can we make sense of this?”\n\n“Finding a black hole that’s not in the nucleus of a massive galaxy is in itself unusual, but what’s even more unusual is the story of how it may have gotten there,” van Dokkum added. “It likely didn’t just arrive there, but instead it formed there. And pretty recently. In other words, we think we’re witnessing the birth of a supermassive black hole – something that has never been seen before.”\n\nSupermassive Black Hole Formation\n\nThe origin of supermassive black holes has long puzzled scientists. Two main hypotheses dominate the field. The first, known as the “light seed” theory, suggests that many small black holes form through the collapse of stars and gradually merge into a supermassive black hole. However, this theory struggles to explain how some black holes appear so early in the universe’s history—suggesting that they didn’t have enough time to form through successive mergers.\n\nThe alternative is the “heavy seed” theory, which posits that supermassive black holes can form directly, as massive gas clouds collapse under their own gravity, producing black holes of around a million solar masses.\n\nData from the Infinity Galaxy offers a potential real-world example of the heavy seed model. First, two galaxies collide, producing the unique structure of the Infinity Galaxy. The impact shocks and compresses gas within the system. That compression could then cause a dense knot of gas to collapse, giving birth to a supermassive black hole.\n\n“There is quite a bit of circumstantial evidence for this,” van Dokkum explained. “We observe a large swath of ionized gas, specifically hydrogen that has been stripped of its electrons, that’s right in the middle between the two nuclei, surrounding the supermassive black hole. We also know that the black hole is actively growing – we see evidence of that in X-rays from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and radio from the Very Large Array. Nevertheless, the question is, did it form there?”’\n\nAlternative Theories\n\nThe team also considered two other possible explanations. One involves a black hole being ejected from its home galaxy and eventually joining the Infinity Galaxy as a runaway object. The other posits that the black hole may belong to a third, faint dwarf galaxy occupying the same area of the sky. However, dwarf galaxies typically lack black holes, making this explanation less likely.\n\n“If the black hole were a runaway, or if it were in an unrelated galaxy, we would expect it to have a very different velocity from the gas in the Infinity Galaxy,” van Dokkum said. “We realized that this would be our test – measure the velocity of the gas and the velocity of the black hole, and compare them. If the velocities are close, within maybe 30 miles per second (50 kilometers per second), then it becomes hard to argue that the black hole is not formed out of that gas.”\n\nContinuing to Study the Infinity Galaxy\n\nTo further investigate, the team was granted director’s discretionary time on the James Webb Space Telescope to observe the Infinity Galaxy in greater detail. Three early findings are especially intriguing: the extended distribution of ionized gas between the nuclei, the centered location of the black hole, and the presence of supermassive black holes within both nuclei—making a total of three.\n\nThis rare triple black hole configuration was described by van Dokkum as an “unexpected bonus.”\n\n“We can’t say definitively that we have found a direct collapse black hole,” van Dokkum concluded. “But we can say that these new data strengthen the case that we’re seeing a newborn black hole, while eliminating some of the competing explanations.\n\n“We will continue to pore through the data and investigate these possibilities,” van Dokkum added.\n\nThe paper, “The ∞ Galaxy: A Candidate Direct-collapse Supermassive Black Hole between Two Massive, Ringed Nuclei,” appeared on July 15, 2025, in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nRyan Whalen covers science and technology for The Debrief.

        "content": "(Main) An illustration shows two neutron stars colliding and merging, creating a kilonova explosion. (Inset) The Nancy Grace Roman space telescope will hunt these and many more types of cosmic explosions\n\nIt's little wonder that astronomers are excited for the launch of NASA's next big space telescope project, the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope.\n\nRecent research has suggested that Roman , currently set to launch no later than May 2027, will discover as many as 100,000 powerful cosmic explosions as it conducts the High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey observation program.\n\nThese powerful and violent events will include supernovas that signal the deaths of massive stars, kilonovas , which happen when two of the universe's most extreme dead stars, or \"neutron stars,\" slam together, and \"burps\" of feeding supermassive black holes . Roman could even detect the explosive destruction of the universe's first generation of stars .\n\nThese explosions could help scientists crack the mystery of dark energy , the placeholder name for the strange force that is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate, and a multitude of other cosmic conundrums.\n\n\"Whether you want to explore dark energy, dying stars, galactic powerhouses, or probably even entirely new things we’ve never seen before, this survey will be a gold mine,\" research leader Benjamin Rose, an assistant professor at Baylor University, said in a statement.\n\nRoman will hunt white dwarfs that go boom!\n\nThe High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey will obtain its explosive results by scanning the same large region of space every five days for a period of two years.\n\nThese observations will then be \"stitched together\" to create movies revealing a wealth of cosmic explosions.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

(Image credit: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center)\n\nMany of these will be Type Ia supernovas , a type of cosmic explosion that occurs when a \"dead star\" or white dwarf feeds on a companion star so ravenously that it blows its top.\n\nThese cosmic explosions are vital to astronomers because their light output and peak brightness are so regular from event to event that they can be used to measure cosmic distances. This regularity means astronomers refer to Type Ia supernovas as \"standard candles.\"\n\nThis new research, which simulated Roman's entire High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey, suggests the space telescope could reveal up to 27,000 new Type Ia supernovas. That is about 10 times as many of these white dwarf destroying explosions as the combined harvest of all previous surveys.\n\nAn illustration of a white dwarf star feeding on a stellar companion prior to a type Ia supernova (Image credit: Robert Lea (created with Canva))\n\nBy looking at standard candles across differing vast distances, astronomers are essentially looking back into cosmic time, and that allows them to determine how fast the universe was expanding at these times.\n\nThus, such a wealth of Type Ia supernovas should reveal hints at the secrets of dark energy. This could help verify recent findings from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) that suggest this strange force is actually weakening over time .\n\n\"Filling these data gaps could also fill in gaps in our understanding of dark energy,\" Rose explained. \"Evidence is mounting that dark energy has changed over time, and Roman will help us understand that change by exploring cosmic history in ways other telescopes can't.\"\n\nDying stars tell the tale of the stellar life cycle\n\nThe team estimates that as many as 60,000 of the 100,000 cosmic explosions that could be detected by Roman will be so-called \"core collapse supernovas.\"\n\nThese occur when massive stars at least 8 times heavier than the sun reach the end of their nuclear fuel and can no longer support themselves against gravitational collapse.\n\nAs these stars' cores rapidly collapse, the outer layers are blasted away in supernovas, spreading the elements forged by these stars through the cosmos to become the building blocks of the next generation of stars, their planets, and maybe even lifeforms dwelling on said planets. Core collapse supernovas leave behind either neutron stars or black holes, depending on the mass of the progenitor star.\n\nThis means that while they can't help unravel the mystery of dark energy like Type Ia supernovas may, they can tell the tale of stellar life and death.\n\nStellar material swirls around a supernova created black hole (Image credit: Robert Lea (created with Canva))\n\n\"By seeing the way an object's light changes over time and splitting it into spectra — individual colors with patterns that reveal information about the object that emitted the light—we can distinguish between all the different types of flashes Roman will see,\" research team member Rebekah Hounsell from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center explained. \"With the dataset we've created, scientists can train machine-learning algorithms to distinguish between different types of objects and sift through Roman's downpour of data to find them.\n\n\"While searching for Type Ia supernovas, Roman is going to collect a lot of cosmic 'bycatch'—other phenomena that aren't useful to some scientists, but will be invaluable to others.\"\n\nRare cosmic gems and pure gold kilonovas\n\nOne of the rarer events that Roman could also detect occurs when black holes devour unfortunate stars that wander too close to them.\n\nDuring these tidal disruption events (TDEs), the doomed star is ripped apart by the tremendous gravitational influence of the black hole via the immense tidal forces it generates.\n\nThough much of the star is consumed by the black hole, these cosmic titans are messy eaters, meaning the vast amount of that stellar material is vomited out at velocities approaching the speed of light.\n\nA black hole rips apart a star and devours it in a tidal disruption event (Image credit: Carl Knox – OzGrav, ARC Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery, Swinburne University of Technology)\n\nThis jet of matter and the stellar material of the destroyed star that settles around the black hole in a flattened swirling cloud called an accretion disk generate emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nRoman will hunt these emissions to detect TDEs, with this team predicting that the High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey will turn up around 40 of these star-destroying events.\n\nEven more elusive than TDEs are kilonovas, explosive bursts of light that occur when two neutron stars smash together and merge.\n\nThe team estimates that Roman could uncover around 5 new kilonovas, and while this is a small harvest, these observations could be vital to understanding where precious metals like gold and silver come from.\n\nAn illustration shows two neutron stars colliding and merging generating a kilonoav explosion (Image credit: Robert Lea (created with Canva))\n\nThough most of the elements we see around us are generated at the heart of stars, even these stellar furnaces lack the pressures and temperatures needed to form elements heavier than iron. The environments around neutron star collisions are thought to be the only furnaces in the cosmos extreme enough to generate elements like gold, silver and plutonium.\n\nThese would start life as even heavier elements that are unstable and rapidly decay. This decay releases the light seen as kilonovas, and thus studying that light is vital to understanding that process.\n\nThe study of kilonovas could also help determine what types of celestial bodies are created when neutron stars merge. This could be an even larger neutron star that rapidly collapses into a black hole, an immediately formed black hole, or something entirely new and unthought of.\n\nThus far, astronomers have only definitively confirmed the detection of one kilonova, meaning even another five would be a real boon to science.\n\nRoman looks for instability in the first stars\n\nPerhaps the most exciting cosmic explosion discovery that Roman could make would be the observation of the strange explosive death of the universe's first stars.\n\nCurrently, it is theorized that these early massive stars may have died differently than modern stars.\n\nRather than undergoing the core collapse described above, gamma-rays within the first stars could have generated matter-antimatter pairs in the form of electrons and positrons. These particles would meet and annihilate each other within the star, and this would release energy, resulting in a self-detonation called a \"pair-instability supernova.”\n\nThese blasts are so powerful that it is theorized that they leave nothing behind, barring the fingerprint of elements generated during that star's lifetime.\n\nAn illustration of pair-instability supernovae from very massive early stars leaving chemical fingerprints throughout the universe. (Image credit: NAOC)\n\nAs of yet, astronomers have dozens of candidates for pair-instability supernovas, but none have been confirmed. The team's simulation suggests that Roman could turn up as many as ten confirmed pair-instability supernovas.\n\n\"I think Roman will make the first confirmed detection of a pair-instability supernova,\" Rose said. \"They're incredibly far away and very rare, so you need a telescope that can survey a lot of the sky at a deep exposure level in near-infrared light, and that's Roman.\"\n\nThe team intends to perform a further simulation of Roman's study of the cosmos, which could indicate its capability to spot and even wider array of powerful and violent events, maybe even some that haven't yet been theorized.\n\n\"Roman's going to find a whole bunch of weird and wonderful things out in space, including some we haven't even thought of yet,\" Hounsell concluded. \"We're definitely expecting the unexpected.\"\n\nThis research was published on Tuesday (July 15) in The Astrophysical Journal.",

        "content": "In 1990, NASA launched the Hubble Space Telescope. It had faced years of delays and cost overruns, but it proved the existence of black holes, calculated the age of the universe, and delivered astonishing views of deep space.\n\nBut now, NASA has built something 100 times more powerful, capable of seeing stars so distant, their light has been traveling for nearly 14 billion years, since just after the Big Bang. It's the most ambitious, complex space observatory ever built: the James Webb Space Telescope. And it's scheduled to lift off in 10 days.\n\nScott Willoughby works for Northrup Grumman (which NASA hired to do most of the design and construction), and is the Webb's program manager. \"It's got seven times the collecting area, a mirror which collects more light, to see things that are either dimmer or further away,\" Willoughby explained.\n\nThe Webb will see a different kind of light than the Hubble did – the light from very distant, very old stars is infrared light.\n\n\"So, we're designing an eye like night vision goggles for the sky, where we're going to find infrared out in the universe,\" said Willoughby.\n\nThe main mirror is made up of 18 gold hexagons, each adjustable. Correspondent David Pogue asked, \"Was it made golden for looks?\"\n\n\"It was not!\" Willoughby replied. \"Gold reflects infrared.\"\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope will be launched later this month, to be deployed one million miles from Earth. CBS News\n\nNow, infrared is a form of heat. So, any warmth from the sun and the Earth would blind this telescope to distant starlight. The telescope can only work if it is super-cold – like space itself. To block out any shred of sunlight, the Webb will deploy a sun shield. It has five layers of a material like Mylar, each one the thickness of a human hair, that will separate the cold side (-400°F) from the hot side (about +200°F), and keep sunlight from ever touching the mirrors' surface.\n\nThere's another way to keep a telescope cold, too: \"We send it four times further away than the moon; we're one million miles away,\" Willoughby said. \"And with that, we can keep our optics colder.\"\n\nBut you haven't even heard the hardest part. This telescope is three stories tall and as wide as a tennis court – too big to fit into any existing rocket. NASA's solution? Fold it up, like origami.\n\nPogue said, \"This is the part that worries me as a layperson. I mean, how complex is this unfolding process?\"\n\nThe components of the telescope will unfold after launch, like origami. CBS News\n\n\"It's good to be worried!\" said Willoughby. \"They have things that are called single-point failures, right? This has to move this way, and there's only one of 'em, right? And Webb has over 300 of those.\"\n\n\"Three hundred things that have to go exactly right?\"\n\n\"Correct.\"\n\nIf even one of them fails, the Webb telescope becomes the Web space junk. A million miles is much too far away to send a repair mission, as we did for the Hubble.\n\n\"So, what do you do with those?\" Willoughby said. \"You test 'em to greater extremes than they'll ever see.\"\n\nAll that additional testing and caution helps explain the telescope's 14 years of delays, and its $9.7 billion price tag.\n\n\"Every time we learn something, we had to repeat a series of tests,\" said Willoughby. \"But all of that is because we have to learn on the ground.\"\n\nPogue asked, \"So, at this point, days away from the launch, how confident are you?\"\n\n\"Confidence is built, to me, out of, 'Did we do everything that we could possibly have done?' I can confidently say we did everything that we needed to do. We took every piece of it and we did the best we absolutely, possibly could.\"\n\nIf all goes well, then by the summer of 2022, this machine will get down to its work: Science.\n\nNASA's Stefanie Milam, one of the telescope's science officers, said, \"JWST is going to rewrite the textbooks. And I think the science that's going to come out of this is mind-blowing.\n\n\"We're going to see the first stars and galaxies and understand how the evolution of our universe actually started. We're going to be able to study the atmospheres of planets around other stars that we've never had access to.\"\n\nNASA\n\nMost exciting of all, Milam expects the Webb Telescope to discover things we never even thought to look for, as the Hubble has done many times. \"There are going to be things that we aren't prepared for,\" she said. \"We'll have to figure out how to use the telescope in different ways and plan for the unexpected.\"\n\nAfter the scheduled launch on December 22, Scott Willoughby will have to wait 29 days to find out if the unfolding worked, and then five months more for the telescope to calibrate and cool down. \"So, in the end, it takes us a half-a-year before you'll be reporting on some image that humankind has never seen before in our lives,\" he said.\n\n\"And is that the point where you can finally sleep at night?\" Pogue asked.\n\n\"Yeah. I'll feel a lot better then!\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Young Kim. Editor: Emanuele Secci.",

        "content": "Once again the James Webb Space Telescope has been set to study an extraordinary NASA discovery. This time, James Webb will be in charge of studying an exoplanet called TOI-6894b, which orbits the red dwarf star TOI-6894 in the constellation Leo. This discovery by NASA, published in Nature Astronomy and based on data from the TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) mission, reveals a gas planet about the size of Saturn with a unique atmosphere where compounds like methane and ammonia are expected.\n\nI’m sure you have heard about the James Webb Telescope if you are into reading NASA articles, because this is one of the most powerful telescopes from NASA and it has been part of many missions. So, let’s learn more about what the James Webb Telescope has done and what it might reveal about planetary formation around small stars.\n\nA planet nearly the size of Saturn\n\nNASA recently found a giant gas planet, almost as big as Saturn, orbiting a tiny star called a red dwarf. This star is really small—only about 20% the size of our Sun—and it’s located in the constellation Leo. Scientists were shocked when they found this event because they thought it was impossible for small stars to form planets of such big size.\n\nWhy was this not expected?\n\nThe reason is that smaller stars have protoplanetary disks (the regions of gas and dust around a star where planets form) with less material to form large bodies. In theory, with less gas and dust, a giant planet should not form. However, the planet found, called TOI-6894b, has a radius slightly larger than Saturn’s but only half its mass, which means it is a low-density, very “fluffy” planet. It is the smallest giant planet known to orbit such a small star.\n\nDoes this discovery affect current theories?\n\nThe discovery has thrown a wrench into traditional ideas about how planets form—especially the core accretion theory. That model says a rocky core builds up gradually, then pulls in gas over time to become a giant planet. But for that to happen, there needs to be plenty of material and time—something small stars like TOI-6894 aren’t thought to have. So how did TOI-6894b come to be? Astronomers have two main ideas:\n\nMaybe the planet formed slowly but never went through a rapid gas-grabbing phase.\n\nMaybe the disk of gas and dust around the star became unstable and collapsed straight into a planet, skipping the core-building stage altogether.\n\nAn interesting and cold atmosphere\n\nTOI-6894b’s temperature is around 420 Kelvin (about 150°C), which is much lower than that of most gas giants we’ve found, known as “hot Jupiters.” Because it’s cooler, it’s a good candidate for studying atmospheres that might contain rare chemical compounds.\n\nScientists are particularly hoping to detect methane, which is already uncommon out there. Even more exciting is the chance of spotting ammonia (NH₃)—something that’s never been confidently confirmed in an exoplanet’s atmosphere before.\n\nFuture observations with the James Webb telescope\n\nScientists are already relying on the James Webb Space Telescope to study this planet’s atmosphere in detail. In the next few months, we’ll learn a lot more about this world, which could give us new answers—or even raise new questions—about how planets form and how different planets can be.\n\nDiscoveries like TOI-6894b shows that space is full of surprises scientists may discover in the future. When we thought we understood how planets form, something new appears and changes everything. With powerful tools like the James Webb Space Telescope, scientists have a better chance of finding out more about these cosmic mysteries. Aren’t you intrigued about what’s out there in space?",

        "content": "Scientists predict one of the major surveys by NASA's upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope may reveal around 100,000 celestial blasts, ranging from exploding stars to feeding black holes. Roman may even find evidence of some of the universe's first stars, which are thought to completely self-destruct without leaving any remnant behind.\n\nCosmic explosions offer clues to some of the biggest mysteries of the universe. One is the nature of dark energy, the mysterious pressure thought to be accelerating the universe's expansion.\n\n\"Whether you want to explore dark energy, dying stars, galactic powerhouses, or probably even entirely new things we've never seen before, this survey will be a gold mine,\" said Benjamin Rose, an assistant professor at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, who led a study about the results. The paper is published in The Astrophysical Journal.\n\nCalled the High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey, this observation program will scan the same large region of the cosmos every five days for two years. Scientists will stitch these observations together to create movies that uncover all sorts of cosmic fireworks.\n\nChief among them are exploding stars. The survey is largely geared toward finding a special class of supernova called type Ia. These stellar cataclysms allow scientists to measure cosmic distances and trace the universe's expansion because they peak at about the same intrinsic brightness. Figuring out how fast the universe has ballooned during different cosmic epochs offers clues to dark energy.\n\nIn the new study, scientists simulated Roman's entire High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey. The results suggest Roman could see around 27,000 type Ia supernovae -- about 10 times more than all previous surveys combined.\n\nBeyond dramatically increasing our total sample of these supernovae, Roman will push the boundaries of how far back in time we can see them. While most of those detected so far occurred within approximately the last 8 billion years, Roman is expected to see vast numbers of them earlier in the universe's history, including more than a thousand that exploded more than 10 billion years ago and potentially dozens from as far back as 11.5 billion years. That means Roman will almost certainly set a new record for the farthest type Ia supernova while profoundly expanding our view of the early universe and filling in a critical gap in our understanding of how the cosmos has evolved over time.\n\n\"Filling these data gaps could also fill in gaps in our understanding of dark energy,\" Rose said. \"Evidence is mounting that dark energy has changed over time, and Roman will help us understand that change by exploring cosmic history in ways other telescopes can't.\"\n\nBut type Ia supernovae will be hidden among a much bigger sample of exploding stars Roman will see once it begins science operations in 2027. The team estimates Roman will also spot about 60,000 core-collapse supernovae, which occur when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses under its own weight.\n\nThat's different from type Ia supernovae, which originate from binary star systems that contain at least one white dwarf -- the small, hot core remnant of a Sun-like star -- siphoning material from a companion star. Core-collapse supernovae aren't as useful for dark energy studies as type Ias are, but their signals look similar from halfway across the cosmos.\n\n\"By seeing the way an object's light changes over time and splitting it into spectra -- individual colors with patterns that reveal information about the object that emitted the light -- we can distinguish between all the different types of flashes Roman will see,\" said Rebekah Hounsell, an assistant research scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County working at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland and a co-author of the study.\n\n\"With the dataset we've created, scientists can train machine-learning algorithms to distinguish between different types of objects and sift through Roman's downpour of data to find them,\" Hounsell added. \"While searching for type Ia supernovae, Roman is going to collect a lot of cosmic 'bycatch' -- other phenomena that aren't useful to some scientists, but will be invaluable to others.\"\n\nHidden Gems\n\nThanks to Roman's large, deep view of space, scientists say the survey should also unearth extremely rare and elusive phenomena, including even scarcer stellar explosions and disintegrating stars.\n\nUpon close approach to a black hole, intense gravity can shred a star in a so-called tidal disruption event. The stellar crumbs heat up as they swirl around the black hole, creating a glow astronomers can see from across vast stretches of space-time. Scientists think Roman's survey will unveil 40 tidal disruption events, offering a chance to learn more about black hole physics.\n\nThe team also estimates Roman will find about 90 superluminous supernovae, which can be 100 times brighter than a typical supernova. They pack a punch, but scientists aren't completely sure why. Finding more of them will help astronomers weigh different theories.\n\nEven rarer and more powerful, Roman could also detect several kilonovae. These blasts occur when two neutron stars -- extremely dense cores leftover from stars that exploded as supernovae -- collide. To date, there has been only one definitive kilonova detection. The team estimates Roman could spot five more.\n\nThat would help astronomers learn much more about these mysterious events, potentially including their fate. As of now, scientists are unsure whether kilonovae result in a single neutron star, a black hole, or something else entirely.\n\nRoman may even spot the detonations of some of the first stars that formed in the universe. These nuclear furnaces were giants, up to hundreds of times more massive than our Sun, and unsullied by heavy elements that hadn't yet formed.\n\nThey were so massive that scientists think they exploded differently than modern massive stars do. Instead of reaching the point where a heavy star today would collapse, intense gamma rays inside the first stars may have turned into matter-antimatter pairs (electrons and positrons). That would drain the pressure holding the stars up until they collapsed, self-destructing in explosions so powerful they're thought to leave nothing behind.\n\nSo far, astronomers have found about half a dozen candidates of these \"pair-instability\" supernovae, but none have been confirmed.\n\n\"I think Roman will make the first confirmed detection of a pair-instability supernova,\" Rose said -- in fact the study suggests Roman will find more than 10. \"They're incredibly far away and very rare, so you need a telescope that can survey a lot of the sky at a deep exposure level in near-infrared light, and that's Roman.\"\n\nA future rendition of the simulation could include even more types of cosmic flashes, such as variable stars and active galaxies. Other telescopes may follow up on the rare phenomena and objects Roman discovers to view them in different wavelengths of light to study them in more detail.\n\n\"Roman's going to find a whole bunch of weird and wonderful things out in space, including some we haven't even thought of yet,\" Hounsell said. \"We're definitely expecting the unexpected.\"",

        "content": "Kepler delivered on Earth-size planets. “Kepler 10b was identified in the first 10 days of data we got back from the spacecraft,” Batalha said. When they graphed the brightness of the host star over time, the dip was visible to the eye. Follow-up observations from the ground confirmed it was a genuine planet and one that, based on its mass and radius, had to be rocky. Batalha presented the unequivocal detection in January 2011, following a more tentative claim of a rocky exoplanet labeled CoRoT-7b by astronomers in Europe. Neither Kepler 10b nor CoRoT-7b earned the coveted designation “Earth-like,” because they orbited near their parent star rather than in the “habitable zone,” where water is liquid. (The first rocky, watery and potentially Earth-like planet, Kepler 186f, made headlines in 2014. Batalha wasn’t formally involved with the analysis.)\n\nThe Kepler telescope, before being prematurely hobbled by the failure of two of its motors, discovered more than 2,600 exoplanets. More than 4,500 have been counted in all, a sufficient number for astronomers to study their statistical properties. Just as 51 Pegasi b had suggested, our solar system is atypical. For instance, the most common type of planet in the galaxy is a size we don’t have, in between rocky planets and giants. Planetary astronomers don’t yet understand the surplus of these so-called super-Earths or sub-Neptunes, or what these midsize planets are like, or how they form. New principles of planet formation and evolution are needed.\n\nExtrapolating the data so far, researchers think that our galaxy holds billions of rocky, watery planets, suggesting that life, too, might be common. Until we find evidence of life actually inhabiting another planet, though, it remains possible that its emergence on Earth was a fluke, and that we are alone.\n\nHappily, the Webb telescope will be powerful enough to probe the atmospheres and climates of other Earths — or even, if we’re very lucky, find evidence of an actual alien biosphere.\n\n“Infrared is fantastic for exoplanets,” Batalha said.\n\nOne Strike and You’re Out\n\nOne morning in 1987, the astrophysicist Riccardo Giacconi, who was then the director of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) and of the yet-to-launch Hubble, asked deputy director Garth Illingworth to start thinking about Hubble’s successor. “My immediate reaction is, ‘Argh, we haven’t even got Hubble launched yet, and we’ve got a million things to do on there — it has major problems — so how can we do this as well?’” Illingworth recalled recently. “He said, ‘Trust me, you’ve got to start early because I know it takes ages to do this.’” Hubble had been under development since around 1970, spearheaded in its early years by the NASA astronomer Nancy Roman following decades of campaigning by Princeton’s Lyman Spitzer; they are known as the mother and father of Hubble.\n\nIllingworth, who is from Australia, got together with his STScI colleagues Pierre Bely of France and Peter Stockman of the U.S. to brainstorm about the next-generation space telescope. They had basically nothing to go on. “We started thinking about what would be good to go beyond Hubble and to complement whatever it did and explore new areas,” Illingworth said, “and the IR was one clear area.” Infrared light is prohibitively difficult to observe from the ground. The trio figured that in space, where the infrared background is more than 1 million times lower, there would be plenty to see. “When you put a powerful new capability out there, you open an immense number of scientific horizons.”\n\nFor an IR telescope to be as sensitive as Hubble, which has a 2.4-meter-wide primary mirror, Illingworth, Bely and Stockman realized that it would need to be significantly bigger, since it detects bigger wavelengths. They considered that the mirror might have to fold to fit in a rocket. They also knew it had to be cold, otherwise its heat would saturate its own sensors. Rather than actively cool the telescope, they thought to exploit the extreme frigidity of outer space by blocking the heat of the Earth, moon and sun. Their vague conception of a large, passively cooled infrared telescope, greatly elaborated upon, would become the cargo now awaiting launch in Kourou.\n\nLeading astronomers convened at STScI in 1989 to discuss the science that an infrared space telescope might be good for. Discussions slowed during Hubble’s disastrous start and salvation, then picked up again in the mid-’90s. In 1995, John Mather, a reedy, gentlemanly astrophysicist at the Goddard Space Flight Center, got a call from NASA headquarters asking if he’d like to join the project. Realizing that an infrared telescope “would do so much for so many people,” he dropped everything and signed on. He’s been JWST’s top scientist ever since.\n\nMather calls himself a “theoretical instrument builder.” He started building telescopes as a kid in pastoral New Jersey, assembling parts from catalogs in the hope of getting a closer look at the surface of Mars. As a young man in the 1970s, Mather worked on a balloon-borne instrument that failed; he and his colleagues concluded that they hadn’t tested it enough before launch. “Murphy’s law had been proven one more time,” he wrote in an autobiographical account. But lessons learned led to the triumph of COBE, the NASA satellite experiment for which he and George Smoot would share the Nobel. In the early ’90s, COBE measured the subtle variations in the cosmic microwave background that are thought to have seeded all later cosmological structures. In Mather’s mind, theorizing about the cosmos is fine, but you need ingenious instruments to know anything for sure. “So let’s build the equipment,” he told me this fall. “To me that’s a heroic thing to do.”",

        "content": "NASA just launched the most powerful space telescope ever. Watch it here\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption NASA NASA\n\nThe most powerful space telescope ever built has officially left Earth. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope blasted off on Dec. 25 at 7:20 a.m. Eastern from a European spaceport in French Guiana, unleashing a rumble that could be felt in the control center.\n\n\"Go Webb!\" range operations manager Jean-Luc Voyer called out after the spacecraft completed a crucial maneuver soon after liftoff. Cheers erupted in the control room. Mission members in face masks donned bright red Santa hats in celebration of the successful Christmas Day launch.\n\nThe roughly $10 billion observatory, which is bigger and more sophisticated than the iconic Hubble Space Telescope, has been in the works since the late 1980s. What it finds could revolutionize our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Watch the key moment below:\n\nThe relief among mission members as they cheered, clapped and hugged was almost palpable: Even though aerospace experts consider the Ariane 5 rocket to be highly reliable, there was always the fear of a launch mishap or an explosion that would obliterate its precious cargo in an instant.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I think the first few minutes of the launch will be the most worrisome as there is nothing to be done if something goes wrong,\" Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science told NPR.\n\nBut so far, the spacecraft has had what officials called a \"flawless\" launch.\n\n\"A revolutionary technology\"\n\nThe massive telescope is designed to capture infrared light, especially from galaxies so far away that their light has been traveling through space for almost the entire history of the universe.\n\n\"We are expecting to see the light from the first galaxies that formed some 100 [million], 200 million years after the Big Bang,\" NASA administrator Bill Nelson said in a pre-launch briefing. \"It will deliver world-class science. It's a revolutionary technology that will study every phase of 13-and-a-half billion years of cosmic history.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption NASA NASA\n\nWhat's more, he said, the James Webb Space Telescope will be able to study the atmospheres of planets beyond our solar system, to try to determine if they might be habitable — or maybe even inhabited.\n\n\"It's going to give us a better understanding of our universe and our place in it,\" Nelson said.\n\nSpeaking after the launch, Nelson alluded to the long delays that had plagued the $10 billion project and helped drive up its ultimate price tag.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption ESA-M.Pedoussaut ESA-M.Pedoussaut\n\nHe also cautioned that \"there are still innumerable things that have to work\" to make the telescope a success — 344 of them, to be exact.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We know that in great reward, there is great risk,\" he said. \"And that's what this business is all about. And that's why we dare to explore. The James Webb Space Telescope is very much a part of that exploration.\"\n\nThe telescope is named after a former NASA administrator who led the agency in the 1960s, and it stands about three stories tall, with a mirror that's 21 feet across. The instrument is so big that it had to be folded up to fit into its rocket, and will need to unfold out in space.\n\nThe development of its complex technology was marked by repeated delays and major cost overruns, and in 2011, some lawmakers in Congress even tried to kill it.\n\n\"As with most extraordinary projects that are transformative, there have been some speed bumps, there have been some setbacks along the way,\" Nelson noted. \"We've always known that this project would be a risky endeavor. But, of course, when you want a big reward you have to usually take a big risk.\"\n\nAfter launch, 2 weeks of terror\n\nAfter safely reaching space, the telescope still needs to go through a nerve-wracking, 29-day campaign to get set up and positioned at its observation point, about a million miles away from Earth.\n\nMinutes after separating from the Ariane 5 rocket, the spacecraft deployed its solar panel for power. Later today, it will use its small rocket engines to make a course correction maneuver. A day after launch, it will release its high-gain antenna.\n\nIn the first two weeks after launch, controllers at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore will methodically send orders to the telescope, taking it through a series of steps that will unfurl its sunshield, which is the size of a tennis court, and unfold the \"wings\" of the large mirror.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe unfurling of the thin, flexible sunshield, which has five layers, is what engineers have focused on in terms of thinking about potential problems that might crop up while deploying the telescope's key components.\n\n\"The sunshield is the one that has some risk to it, and we've certainly tried to concentrate on that,\" Mike Menzel, NASA's lead mission systems engineer, said in a briefing for reporters.\n\nAssuming all goes well, the telescope will start to cool down to a frosty minus 370 degrees Fahrenheit. Getting that cold is absolutely crucial: It keeps the telescope's own heat from interfering with the infrared light that it's trying to capture from distant objects.\n\nControllers will also need to precisely align the mirror's 18 hexagonal segments, using tiny motors that can move each separate segment, and the telescope will undergo calibration testing and various checkouts. The first images from the telescope should be released about six months after launch.\n\nSome astronomers have already been granted time to use the telescope and funding after submitting research proposals. One of them is Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.\n\nBefore the launch, Faherty said she felt anxious and hopeful that everything would go well because of her own personal investment in the telescope — but she also wanted it to succeed because of its significance for science and humanity more broadly.\n\n\"My career is kind of anchored in this,\" Faherty said. \"But then, I'm just a human, and I'm like 'Wow, what are we about to do?' We're launching this amazing engineering feat into the cosmos.\"",

        "content": "LONDON -- With the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the ascension of King Charles III, there is a new line of succession to the British throne.\n\nElizabeth's first-born, Charles, became king after she died on Sept. 8, 2022. Charles was officially crowned during his coronation at Westminster Abbey in London on May 2. And as he takes his place on the throne, members of his direct family, including his sons Princes William and Harry, are now higher in the line of succession.\n\nThe royals appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony during the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla on May 6, 2023 in London. Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\n\nIn general, succession falls to the first-born child of the heir and their children, followed by the next oldest sibling of the heir and their offspring and so on. That's why, for instance, Charles' children and grandchildren are ahead in line of his oldest brother, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York.\n\nOther rules make the order more complicated.\n\nUnder British laws established in the late 1600s and early 1700s, the succession to the throne can be regulated by Parliament, which can remove monarchs for \"misgovernment,\" according to the royal family's website.\n\nIn order to be king or queen, the sovereign must be in communion with the Church of England and must promise to uphold the Protestant succession.\n\nFrom left, Britain's Prince George, Kate Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Louis, Prince William and Princess Charlotte, arrive for a settling in afternoon at Lambrook School, near Ascot, England, Sept. 7, 2022. Jonathan Brady/Pool via AP\n\nIn 2013, a law called the Succession to the Crown Act ended the centuries-old practice of a younger son superseding an elder daughter in the line of succession.\n\nThe act, which applies to royals born after Oct. 28, 2011, also ended the provisions by which those who marry Roman Catholics are disqualified from the line of succession. The changes came into full effect in March 2015.\n\nAs a result of the act Princess Charlotte of Wales, the daughter of William, Prince of Wales, and his wife, Catherine, Prince of Wales, is ahead in the line of succession over her younger brother, Prince Louis of Wales.\n\nAs a ruler, the British monarch serves as the head of state, within the limits of the constitution.\n\nA new sovereign ascends to the throne upon the death of the previous monarch.\n\nAfter the monarch's death, the Accession Council, a ceremonial body, is expected to meet at St. James's Palace in London as soon as possible to formally proclaim the accession of the successor to the throne and witness the statutory oath.\n\nIf the monarch is still a child when succeeding to the throne, a regent is appointed to perform the royal functions until the monarch turns 18. The same can happen if the monarch is absent or incapacitated, according to the royal family's official website.\n\nBuckingham Palace, Westminster, London, in 2015. Heritage Images via Getty Images, FILE\n\nHere is the current line of succession to the British throne, as listed on the royal family's official website.\n\n1. William, Prince of Wales\n\n2. Prince George of Wales\n\n3. Princess Charlotte of Wales\n\n4. Prince Louis of Wales\n\n5. Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex\n\n6. Prince Archie of Sussex\n\n7. Princess Lilibet of Sussex\n\n8.

        "content": "63 monarchs have sat on the English throne spanning a period of nearly 1,200 years. The passing of the Crown from one sovereign to the next hasn’t always been smooth sailing. Today, a royal line of succession to the British throne is laid out in law due to constitutional developments during the 17th century.\n\nRules on the royal line of succession\n\nThe royal line of succession is the order in which members of the British Royal Family stand in line to inherit the throne. Children of the sovereign are first in order, followed by the nearest blood relative should a ruling monarch be childless.\n\nOnce a monarch's reign ends, the line of succession promptly shifts. The heir ascends to the throne, causing those below to advance in rank. Alongside these changes, adjustments are made to royal titles, duties, and responsibilities.\n\nThis order of succession was certified in law by The Bill of Rights 1689. This Act ensured that succession to the Crown was regulated by Parliament, which also held the power to deprive a monarch of their title if they were found to be guilty of misgovernment.\n\nThe Act of Settlement 1701 then confined the line of succession to legitimate heirs of Sophia of Hanover. They must also maintain affiliation with the Church of England. The 1701 Act stipulated that the British monarch could not, by law, be a Roman Catholic.\n\nMany of these laws remain in force today, however, some have been tweaked and updated.\n\nUpdates to the law of succession\n\nThe Succession to the Crown Act (2013) came into force in 2015 and laid out new rules on royal succession.\n\nUnder the original 17th century Acts, a younger male heir could usurp his older sister to the throne. This male bias was removed in the new rules.\n\nThe 2013 Act allowed members of the Royal Family to marry a Roman Catholic and remain in the line of succession. Previously, marrying a Roman Catholic meant disqualification from inheriting the throne.\n\nHowever, even under the new rules, the sovereign must still not be a Roman Catholic themselves.\n\nThe new Act also stipulated that only the first six in line to the throne required the monarch’s consent to marry. Those from seventh onwards can marry freely.\n\nDisruptions to the line of succession\n\nA period of uncertainty over who should inherit the Crown is called a succession crisis. Over the past 1,200 years, the English monarchy has witnessed several of these moments, as well as other disruptions to the direct line of succession.\n\nBritain's second-longest-reigning monarch, Queen Victoria, was never meant to rule herself. Whilst King George III had fathered 13 children, as he neared the end of his life only one of them had produced a legitimate heir, Princess Charlotte. When she died in childbirth, the King's children all scrambled to marry and produce an heir. In the end, that race was won by his fourth son, Edward, whose wife gave birth to Victoria.\n\nBritain's longest-serving monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, was also never meant to rule but fell directly into the order of succession after her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated the throne to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. This meant the Crown passed to Edward's brother George VI who was the father of Elizabeth.\n\nFurther back in English history, disruptions to the line of succession usually led to violence and bloodshed. For example, when Edward the Confessor died childless in 1066, four claimants to the throne fought to wear the crown.\n\nIn the end, William of Normandy, otherwise known as William the Conqueror, won the right to claim the throne after beating the last of the Anglo-Saxon kings, Harold Godwinson, at the famous Battle of Hastings.\n\nThe current line of succession\n\nThe current ruling British monarch is King Charles III. Here is the line of succession to the throne (as of 2024):\n\n1. The Prince of Wales (Born 1982)\n\nThe firstborn of King Charles III and Princess Diana, Prince William is the heir to the throne and currently takes official residency at Kensington Palace.\n\nEducated at Eton College and the University of St Andrews, Prince William is married to Catherine, The Princess of Wales, and the pair have three children together - Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.\n\nThe prince supports several charitable projects covering a range of topics from homelessness to the environment.\n\n2. Prince George of Wales (Born 2013)\n\nThe eldest child of the Prince and Princess of Wales, George was born at St Mary’s Hospital in London. His full name was announced as George Alexander Louis.\n\nGeorge attended primary school at Thomas’s School in Battersea, an independent prep school, before moving to Lambrook Prep School in Berkshire.\n\n3. Princess Charlotte of Wales (Born 2015)\n\nThe second child and only daughter of William and Catherine, Princess Charlotte was also born at St Mary’s Hospital in London. Her full name was announced as Charlotte Elizabeth Diana.\n\nLike her brother before her, she started school at Thomas’s School in Battersea before also moving to Lambrook Prep School in Berkshire.\n\n4. Prince Louis of Wales (Born 2018)\n\nThe youngest child of the Prince and Princess of Wales, Louis was also born at St Mary’s Hospital in London. His full name was announced as Louis Arthur Charles.\n\nLike his older siblings, Louis attends Lambrook Prep School in Berkshire.\n\n5. The Duke of Sussex (Born 1984)\n\nPrince Harry is the second child of Charles and Diana and up until the birth of William’s children, Harry was second in line to the throne.\n\nLike his brother, Harry was educated at Eton College before attending the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst to complete army officer training. He then saw active duty in Afghanistan on two separate occasions.\n\nIn 2018, Harry married American actress Meghan Markle and the pair have two children together – Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. Two years after they married, Harry and Meghan stepped down as working royals and moved to California where they continue to reside.\n\n6. Prince Archie of Sussex (Born 2019)\n\nThe first-born child of Harry and Meghan, Prince Archie’s full name is Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor.",

        "content": "Queen Elizabeth II, Britain’s longest-serving monarch, died Sept. 8 at the age of 96. Ahead of her funeral and the coronation of her son, King Charles III, Texas A&M Today spoke with Kevin McGlone, a history professor in the College of Arts and Sciences whose areas of specialty include early 20th century Irish and British history.\n\nHow significant is the queen’s passing for the United Kingdom? How, if at all, will this impact the country and its international relations?\n\nThe queen’s death comes at a turbulent time in British politics, with a recent scandal-induced change of prime minister and soaring energy, food and fuel costs. A 2021 poll taken across England, Scotland and Wales showed a 70% approval rating for Queen Elizabeth, but only 50% of respondents thought favorably of her son and heir Charles, now King Charles III. How her death and the accession of Charles to the throne changes public perceptions about the monarchy remains to be seen. Beyond the United Kingdom, 14 countries (previously British colonies) still consider the British monarch to be their head of state, and we could witness across some of these countries, particularly in the Caribbean, a political intensification to remove the monarch as their sovereign.\n\nLiz Truss was recently installed as Britain’s new prime minister. What could the queen’s death mean for Truss as she takes office and forms her agenda?\n\nJust a few days before her death, Queen Elizabeth II swore Liz Truss in as the fifteenth prime minister of her long reign. To get a sense of the length of her span as monarch, Winston Churchill was the British prime minister when she became monarch in 1952.\n\nAs a prime minister, Liz Truss leads the nation’s government and the buck stops with her when it comes to policy decisions. Truss has taken charge of a country reeling from a COVID pandemic-related and Brexit-induced economic downturn, with many fearing a deep recession.\n\nElizabeth, through her annual televised Christmas addresses and Queen’s Speech to parliament, among her many other public engagements, always served as a voice of optimism and comfort through good times and bad.\n\nLiz Truss, who has taken office after a series of scandals involving her predecessor Boris Johnson, needs to quickly respond to the many challenges facing the nation such as skyrocketing inflation and soaring food and fuel costs. Unfortunately for her, King Charles III may not be politically impartial like his mother was. In recent years he has made numerous speeches demanding action on climate change, and recently he slated the actions of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson over his immigration policy. Should the potentially outspoken new king be a thorn in the side of Truss, as she sets out her government’s agenda, remains to be seen.\n\nWhat did Elizabeth II represent as a symbol for the country, especially for the many Brits who don’t remember life before the queen?\n\nFrom coinage to postage stamps, from letter boxes to flags, and of course the national anthem, Queen Elizabeth’s presence was ubiquitous across British society. The royal family is a source of fascination both within and outside the United Kingdom, and the queen’s death has felt almost familial to many mourners.\n\nThe recent highly-rated Netflix series “The Crown,” a blend of history and fiction, allowed viewers to intimately connect with their monarch from the comfort of their own homes, and from their TV sets, the British public got to bear witness to the many burdens she and her nation faced and withstood over the past 70 years.\n\nWhat should we be watching for in terms of the future of the monarchy? What challenges will Charles face going forward?\n\nKing Charles III is 73 years old and is the oldest person ever to become a British monarch. It will be interesting to see how he will be viewed by the British people, the vast majority of whom have never known life without the queen as their sovereign. What is clear is that Charles lacks the appeal of his mother. He is faced with the huge task of becoming that rock his mother undoubtedly was as Britain grapples with political and economic uncertainty.\n\nA recent poll in Great Britain suggests that three-fifths of its people are in favor of the monarchy as opposed to having an elected head of state or republic. Across the Commonwealth, it’s a different story. In Australia, Queen Elizabeth was extremely popular with the vast majority of the people, but with her now gone we may see a rekindling of the debate there between republicans and monarchists, and possibly another referendum, like the one that country had in 1999. We may see similar political drama in New Zealand, Canada and across the Caribbean.\n\nKing Charles III has had a checkered past in the public eye. The intense British media’s scrutiny that followed his 1994 admission of an extra-marital affair with Camilla Parker Bowles (now his wife and Queen Consort) along with his acrimonious 1996 divorce from the much-adored Princess Diana tarnished his image and that of the royal family. The recent sex abuse scandal involving his brother Prince Andrew has further discredited the House of Windsor. It will be interesting to see how the British people respond to their new monarch in the years ahead.",

        "content": "Remains of the Awujale and paramount ruler of Ijebuland, Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona, were buried in Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State, amid tight security.\n\nIjebu-Ode town stood still, as dignitaries and mourners from all walks of life, sons and daughters of Ijebuland, paid the revered monarch last respect.\n\nArmed soldiers, police and other security agents had taken over the palace, his private residence and other strategic locations in Ijebu-Ode to forestall breakdown of law and order.\n\nSPONSOR AD\n\nThere were fears of possible clash between the Muslim and traditional worshippers over the burial rites of the monarch who had insisted that he be laid to rest according to Islamic rites.\n\nThe controversial burial rites law of Ogun State government allows a dead monarch to be buried according to the religion he practiced.\n\nThe provisions of the Obas and Chiefs Law of Ogun State 2021, specifically section 55, governs the preservation and regulation of traditional burial rites.\n\nSubsection (ii) grants a traditional ruler “the right to be buried in accordance with the customs and traditions of the land”, provided that the body is not subjected to mutilation or cannibalisation.\n\nSubsequent subsections (iii) to (v) establish that the relevant traditional council must determine the nature of the rites, register a declaration of those rites with the commissioner within 21 days, and ensure that registration acts as sufficient proof of compliance.\n\nSections 55 and 56 of the law explicitly prohibit harmful practices such as mutilation, cannibalism, and human rituals, and criminalise the killing or use of human parts during burial rites or the installation of a monarch in the state.\n\nHowever, some traditionalists insisted that monarchs are installed according to customs and tradition of the land and as such, they have the right to take charge of the monarch’s burial rites.\n\nOba Adetona initiated the bill, hence, his burial yesterday appeared sets the tone for the enforcement of the law.\n\nDaily Trust gathered that the security agents were beefed up at different locations especially the burial site to avoid the process being hijacked.\n\nThe body of the late Awujale in a motorcade was accompanied by staff of the office of traditional rulers in Ijebuland en route to the Igbeba residential Mosque.\n\nAs predicted, traditionalists who came in their numbers were, however, prevented by security operatives from the Nigeria Army, who marched them to the gate.\n\nThe soldiers had a tough time controlling crowd during the janazat prayers led by the Chief Imam of Ijebuland, Miftaudeen Gbadegesin Ayanbadejo.\n\nThe federal government delegation to the burial was led by the Minister of Marine and Blue Economy, Adegboyega Oyetola and his counterpart in the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, Bosun Tijani.\n\nOthers in attendance were the governors of Ogun and Lagos States, Prince Dapo Abiodun and Babajide Sanwo-Olu; the President of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote; former governor of Ogun State, Aremo Olusegun Osoba; deputy governor of Ogun State, Engr Noimot Salako-Oyedele; Senator Gbenga Daniel; Senator Salis Shuaib and Senator Solomon Adeola.\n\nThey also included the First Lady of Ogun, Bamidele Abiodun; former first lady of the State, Funso Amosun; the Ogbeni Oja of Ijebuland, Olorogun Sunny Kuku; Chairman of Odua Investment, Otunba Abimbola Ashiru; Olori Omooba of Ijebuland, Alhaji Wasiu Ayinde Marshal, sons and daughters of Ijebuland, among others.\n\nMore tributes pour in\n\nGovernor Abiodun described Awujale as a great philanthropist, and one who stood by him in his political journey to the Government House.\n\nHe described the late Oba Adetona, as a reliable father to his people, and that he would be very pained if the monarch was buried in his absence.\n\nOsoba while speaking with newsmen described the late Awujale as a monarch with sharp faculty, and one who kept his reputation till the very end.\n\n“Baba lived a fulfilled life. He’s respected and loved. His reputation, not only in Ijebu but in Ogun State, remains intact to the end.\n\n“He has a sharp faculty and brain because he spoke with the governor a few hours before he died. Today is a day of celebration for a great monarch.”\n\nDangote said Awujale was an influential personality in his lifetime, and that he had come to pay his last respect because of his relationship with him.\n\nDaniel also paid tributes to the Awujale and paramount ruler of Ijebuland who died at 91.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen after signing the condolence register at the private home of the late monarch, Daniel eulogised the life and times of the revered monarch.\n\nThe former Ogun State governor, who described the demise of Awujale as painful, said the paternal support of the monarch would be solely missed.\n\nThe Ansar-Ud-Deen Society of Nigeria also described his passing as a national loss.\n\nIn a statement signed by its National President, Prince Mosediq Adeniji Kazeem, SAN, the body said the late Awujale was not only a revered monarch but also a towering figure in Nigeria’s traditional and sociopolitical landscape.\n\nAs a faithful Muslim and friend of the Ummah, the body said the Awujale remained a symbol of dignity and leadership rooted in cultural values and spiritual integrity.\n\nThree major markets in Ijebu-Ode were shut temporarily in honour of the late Awujale.\n\nA statement revealed that the closure was in line with cultural traditions, to allow sons and daughters of the land to mourn the departed monarch.\n\nThe affected markets included Ita-Ale; Ita -Osu and Oke -Aje.\n\nSuccession battle begins\n\nDaily Trust reports that following the interment of the late Awujale yesterday, search has begun in earnest for the next occupant to the stool.\n\nSources hinted that quiet search for the worthy successor had begun in 2019 after Oba Adetona highlighted conditions that must be considered for a successor.\n\nDuring the 2019 edition of Ojude Oba festival held in August that year, Oba Adetona gave Ijebu kingmakers conditions that must be put into consideration while selecting his successor when he finally joins his ancestors.\n\nOba Adetona said his would-be successor must not be a money bag who would destroy the achievements Ijebuland recorded so far.\n\nThe late monarch told Ijebu kingmakers not to replace him with a moneybag.\n\nHe asked them to call on God in order to select a capable successor worthy of building on the records of the Ijebuland.\n\nThe Awujale also warned that the process of selecting his successor must not be politicised, and asked Ijebu indigenes to reject selection of “incompetent successor.”\n\nOba Adetona, who gave the stern warning, said “Nobody knows when I will join my ancestors.”\n\nOur correspondent learnt that in coming days, the race for the highly revered Yoruba stool will begin openly.\n\nBy the declaration made under Section 4 (2) of the Chief Law 1957 of the Customary Law regulating the selection of the Awujale of Ijebuland Chieftaincy, there are four ruling houses. They are – (i) the Gbelegbuwa Ruling House; (ii) the Anikinaiya Ruling House, where Oba Adetona came from; (iii) the Fusengbuwa Ruling House; and (iv) the Fidipote Ruling House.\n\nFindings revealed that process of selecting a new Awujale involves specific steps outlined in the Ijebu traditional laws and customs, and involve the participation of the kingmakers (members of the highest traditional council) and the ruling houses of Ijebu.\n\nAccording to the general outline of the process, the process begins with the passing of the current Awujale, then consultation with kingmakers who are members of the highest traditional council to initiate the selection process.\n\nThe ruling houses of Ijebu are then consulted to determine which house is next in line to produce a candidate, follow by the nomination of a candidate by the next ruling house for the vacant stool.\n\nThen, the kingmakers are expected to carefully consider the nominated candidates, considering their suitability and adherence to traditional norms. The final selection is made by the kingmakers, who then present the chosen candidate to the Ijebu people. The selected candidate undergoes traditional coronation rites and ceremonies to become the new Awujale.\n\nAccording to the order of rotation in which respective ruling houses are entitled to produce candidates, the ruling house of Fusengbuwa, is heir apparent to the Awujale stool.\n\nGbelegbuwa ruling house produced late Oba Adetona’s predecessor, while he (Adetona) hailed from the Anikinaiya ruling house. In that order, the Fidipote ruling house is next to the current heir apparent.\n\nAwujale Gbelegbuwa became an Oba recorded in Ijebu history in 1760. Gbelegbuwa was resuscitated in 1933 when Daniel Adesanya Gbelegbuwa II ascended the Awujale throne and reigned between 1933-1959. Oba Adetona from Anikinaiya ruling house replaced in 1960.\n\nReports say the first record of Funsengbuwa ruling house was between 1790-1891 after the ruling of the first Gbelegbuwa between 1760-1790.\n\nThe ruling house has many branches across Ijebu-Ode. It includes the Olukoku royal house at Olode, the Ile NLA at Agunsebi Aboki Tunwase, the Awujale whom the British met after 1885-95 and Adekoga Eleruja also from Tunwase/Funsengbuwa ruling house who became the Awujale in 1916.\n\nOba Adenuga Folagbade who was crowned in 1925 also hailed from Fusengbuwa Tunwase ruling house. Many princes of Fusegbuwa ruling houses became Oba in other Ijebu settlements along the Epe road.\n\nFindings by our correspondent revealed the founder of the First City Monument Bank (FCMB), late Otunba Subomi Balogun, came from the ruling house and as such, his four sons, Bolaji, Jide, Ladi and Gboyega are eligible to vie for the throne. Ladi is the CEO of FCMB Group.\n\nIt was gathered that more prominent princes from the ruling house will throw their hats into the ring when the race is finally thrown open.\n\nHowever, one prominent personality being tipped for the throne is the fuji icon, Wasiu Ayinde, who holds the title of Olori Omoba of Ijebu. He hails from Fidipote ruling house, which according to sources, renders him ‘ineligible’.",

        "content": "The British line of succession delineates who will inherit the throne and become the king or queen of Great Britain. Queen Elizabeth II, who died on September 8, 2022, reigned over the U.K. for a record-breaking 70 years. Her husband, Prince Philip, who died in 2021 at 99, was steadily by her side through the years, but he was not in line to succeed her. Instead, after the queen, her firstborn, Charles, ascended to the throne and became the British sovereign. Next in line is his firstborn, William, Prince of Wales, and then William’s firstborn, Prince George.\n\nBut where do other known royals like Princess Charlotte, Princess Beatrice, and baby Lilibet fall in the line for the crown? Whether you’re watching the new season of The Crown or simply brushing up on your royal knowledge, scroll through to see how close your favorite royals are to becoming the heir to the British throne.",

So King Charles III would be facing the left, opposed to his mother Elizabeth's coins, whose pictures face the right.",

Her death is a major milestone for the country, triggering an outpouring of national affection and grief.\n\nIt also comes at a time when the U.K. is transitioning from a deeply controversial prime minister, Boris Johnson, to a new one, Liz Truss, who just took over the job this week. The country faces skyrocketing inflation and the challenge of the biggest war in Europe since 1945.\n\nElizabeth was born into an empire on which the sun never set and was the country's last major figure with a connection to World War II, a searing, ultimately triumphant experience that, for some, continues to define the nation. On V-E Day in 1945, Elizabeth, then 19, described slipping out of Buckingham Palace to join the jubilant crowds.\n\n\"I remember lines of unknown people, linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief,\" she recalled. \"It was one of the most memorable nights of my life.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Max Mumby/Indigo-Pool/Getty Images Max Mumby/Indigo-Pool/Getty Images\n\nLater, Elizabeth watched as Britain lost most of its colonies and much of its power. There were many personal lows, including the divorces of three of her four children; the death of her former daughter-in-law Diana; and a sex scandal involving her son Prince Andrew. Late in her reign, her grandson Prince Harry left the family and England to settle in California with his American wife, Meghan Markle.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThrough the ups and downs of her tenure, her hard work and longevity won her deep admiration across the United Kingdom.\n\nBorn Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor in London in 1926, her ascension to the throne was an accident of history. In 1936, her uncle, King Edward VIII abdicated to marry Wallis Simpson, a divorced American woman. Elizabeth's shy, stammering father assumed the throne as George VI, placing her next in line.\n\nWhen World War II erupted three years later, Princess Elizabeth began performing official royal duties and delivered the first of many broadcasts, billed as addresses to the children of the British Empire.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images\n\nIn 1947, at age 21, she married Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, a dashing naval officer and distant cousin with whom she'd fallen in love in her early teens.\n\nWhile traveling in Kenya five years later, Elizabeth received grim news from home that her father, who suffered from heart disease and cancer, had died in his sleep. A year later, her lavish coronation in Westminster Abbey drew a global TV audience.\n\nElizabeth made a glamorous young queen in the gray, postwar years — but also a remote one. Occasionally, she appeared to drop her guard and allowed TV cameras into her home. She spoke of her embrace of the predictability of royal life and how younger family members chafed under its strictures.\n\n\"If you live this sort of life, which people don't very much,\" she said with a laugh, \"you live very much by tradition and by continuity. I find that's one of the sad things, that people don't take on jobs for life, they try different things all the time.\"\n\nGiven the nature of her job, Elizabeth said she knew exactly what she would be doing in the next two months or even the coming year.\n\n\"I think this is what the younger members [of the royal family] find difficult, is the regimented side of it,\" she added.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDifficulties involving younger royals led to some of the most painful periods of the queen's life.\n\nIn just one year — 1992 — the marriages of her three oldest children collapsed. That November, fire devastated Windsor Castle, her childhood home along the banks of the River Thames outside London.\n\n\"In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an 'annus horribilis,' \" the queen said.\n\n\"I think the queen really felt deeply wounded by the lack of success of her family,\" says Sarah Bradford, the author of several biographies of Elizabeth. \"She just felt humiliated and possibly she felt guilty about it.\"\n\nFive years later, things grew far worse, when paparazzi on motorcycles chased Diana, Princess of Wales, through Paris. She died after the Mercedes she was traveling in crashed into a pillar in a tunnel along the Seine River.\n\nDiana had recently divorced Prince Charles, but remained for many a sympathetic figure.\n\nInstead of returning to London to lead her people in mourning, the queen remained in her castle in Balmoral, comforting her grandchildren, Diana's sons, Princes William and Harry. Many Britons were furious and saw the queen as out of touch and uncaring.\n\n\"The week before Diana's funeral was probably the low point of the queen's life,\" Bradford says, \"because for the first time in her life, she was actually really criticized, deeply criticized.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Yui Mok/WPA Pool/Getty Images Yui Mok/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nBowing to public pressure, the queen returned to London and eventually responded to what she called \"the extraordinary and moving reaction to [Diana's] death.\"\n\nWith that tribute to Diana, the crisis faded. By 2012, when the queen celebrated her 60th year on the throne, she had recovered her popularity. A few weeks later came the London Olympics, where she thrilled a global TV audience by pretending to skydive into the Olympic stadium with Daniel Craig as James Bond.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe queen was known for her love of horses and her signature corgis. As befitting her role as constitutional monarch, she kept any political opinions private. She also remained largely opaque to the public. Some royal observers said that mystique led some Britons to fill in the blanks and see themselves in her.\n\nElizabeth had a sense of humor about her fame and position. She loved to regale guests with a story about meeting two American tourists near her Scottish estate who failed to recognize her. When they asked where she lived, she responded London and added she had a holiday home on the other side of the hills, Balmoral Castle.\n\nThen one of the hikers asked if she had ever met the queen. Elizabeth said she had not, but said her bodyguard, Richard Griffin, who was accompanying her, met the queen regularly.\n\nWhen asked what the queen was like, Griffin said she could be cantankerous, but had a lovely sense of humor. The tourist asked for a picture with Griffin, which the queen took. Then she posed with the tourist.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Yui Mok/Getty Images Yui Mok/Getty Images\n\n\"I'd love to be a fly on the wall when he shows those photos to friends in America,\" said the queen afterward, according to Griffin.\n\nThe queen served as national matriarch, providing comfort and encouragement.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, she made a rare national speech that illustrated the unique role she played in the United Kingdom. The queen reassured the British people and emphasized the country's traditional values.\n\n\"Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it,\" she said from Windsor Castle. \"I hope in the years to come, everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. And those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. The attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humored resolve and of fellow feeling still characterize this country.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nStill recent years brought additional family turmoil and crises that undermined the monarchy, including allegations that a 17-year-old girl was coerced into having sex with Prince Andrew, which he denied in an interview with the BBC.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Markus Schreiber/AP Markus Schreiber/AP\n\nIn 2021, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, said they'd encountered racism within the royal family. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Meghan, who is biracial, said there had been discrimination toward their son, Archie. She said there had been \"concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he's born.\"\n\nIn a statement, Buckingham Palace called the claims \"concerning\" and said the family would address them privately.\n\nAbout a month later, Prince Philip, whom the queen had called \"my strength and stay,\" died at age 99 after more than seven decades of marriage.\n\nWith the queen's passing, her son Charles becomes king.\n\nThe queen was enormously popular, even among Britons who weren't fond of the monarchy. Charles, however, is not. Polls this year showed that only about one-third of the public here wants him as king. Many people remain unhappy with Charles because of how he handled his first marriage.\n\n\"The legacy of the whole Diana catastrophe — it does go very deep,\" said Max Hastings, the former editor of Britain's The Daily Telegraph and the Evening Standard. \"The image that Diana passed onto the world about the Prince of Wales is not a very attractive image. It was an image of a very selfish, quirky, weird man.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jane Barlow/WPA Pool/Getty Images Jane Barlow/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nRoyal watchers say that Charles's lack of popularity and connection to many British people poses a serious challenge to the monarchy as it moves forward.\n\nElizabeth became queen when Winston Churchill was Britain's prime minister and Harry Truman was U.S. president. She worked with 15 British prime ministers and has met 13 of the last 14 American presidents.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nQueen Elizabeth is the only monarch the vast majority of Britons have ever known. Bradford believes history will rank her among the nation's great sovereigns, alongside Queen Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria.\n\n\"I think the queen's legacy will be holding the whole thing together, through bad and good, connecting with the world,\" Bradford says. \"I think she'll be seen as dutiful, good at her job and self-sacrificing in many ways.\"\n\nA quarter-century after assuming the throne, Queen Elizabeth II summarized her role and her relationship with her subjects: \"When I was 21, I pledged my life to the service of our people,\" she said. \"Although that vow was made in my salad days when I was green in judgment, I do not regret nor retract one word of it.\"\n\nPhilip Reeves and Jessica Beck contributed to this story.",

        "content": "World Who's next in line for the throne after King Charles? The British royal family's line of succession in detail\n\n\n\n\n\nYui Mok / Getty Images After an historic 70 years on the throne, Britain's longest-serving monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, died at the age of 96 on Sept. 8, 2022. Her eldest son, Charles, became the new king immediately upon her passing, and his son, Prince William, moved up next in the line of succession. Then, in a coronation ceremony steeped in 1,000 years of tradition, King Charles III was formally crowned on May 6, 2023 in London. There are detailed protocols governing the line of succession and who will take over after Charles' reign. In January 2019, Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, announced plans to pare back their royal duties. However, those plans do not include an abdication, and they remain in the line of succession, as do their two children. Here's a look at who on the royal family tree is in line for the throne, and the order of succession.\n\nKing Charles III Getty Images Succeeding Queen Elizabeth II is her eldest son, Charles, who is now King Charles III. In Britain's monarchy, the heir ascends to the throne immediately upon the death of their predecessor. A formal ceremony and coronation are held later. Charles's wife Camilla now has the title of queen. In 2022, Queen Elizabeth said it was her \"sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort\" — an honor that had not always been assured. When the time came for Charles' coronation, the word \"consort\" was dropped and Camilla was simply referred to as queen. King Charles III — formerly known as Charles, Prince of Wales\n\nRelationship to the throne: Son of Queen Elizabeth II Born: November 14, 1948 Photo: King Charles III and Queen Camilla attend the Royal Maundy Service at York Minster on April 6, 2023 in York, England.\n\n1.

Like his father before him, he's been granted the title Prince of Wales, as well as Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge, and William's wife Catherine is now Princess of Wales.

        "content": "At WWDC 2023, Apple officially unveiled its new Vision Pro headset, which it describes as a “revolutionary spatial computer.” I was in the crowd at today’s keynote when it was announced, and shortly thereafter, I was whisked away on a golf cart to go try out the Apple Vision Pro.\n\nWhen I arrived at the demo building on the far corner of Apple Park, I was then whisked away once again… into an alternate world powered by visionOS.\n\nThe setup process\n\nWhen I arrived at Apple’s special demo building, I went through the process of being fitted for Vision Pro. This was done using a simple scanning system on an iPhone 14 that was similar to the process of setting up Face ID on a new iPhone. The next step was setting up Spatial Audio, which consisted of scanning my face and both ears.\n\nI had some trouble with the Personalized Spatial Audio part of the setup experience, but it didn’t seem to have an impact on the actual Vision Pro experience. The iPhone 14 just didn’t want to scan my left ear for some reason.\n\nI wear contacts rather than glasses, so I didn’t have to go through the vision testing portion of the experience. For those who wear glasses, however, Apple had vision test equipment set up.\n\nWith the boring stuff out of the way, it was time to try the Vision Pro headset itself. I put it on and adjusted the fit to my liking using the Head Band at the top and the flexible strap around the side. It was surprisingly easy to get a snug fit.\n\nUsing visionOS\n\nFrom there, I started exploring visionOS, the operating system that powers the Vision Pro headset. In my first interaction, visionOS showed Apple’s iconic “Hello” message floating in space. From there, I was taken to the Home View. The home screen is similar to the honeycomb view on the Apple Watch. I used my eyes to move through the grid of apps.\n\nvisionOS relies entirely on your eyes, hands, and voice for navigation. I didn’t get to try out any of the voice control features, but the eye and hand control gestures were really impressive. A simple tap of your fingers allows you to select an object. You can zoom in by tapping and pinching just like you would on an iPhone, and you can scroll by flicking your wrist. An open-ended flick of your wrist will activate inertia scrolling just like on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\n\nThere’s absolutely a learning curve to figuring out how to navigate around visionOS, but even in my 30 minutes with Vision Pro, I became pretty comfortable with most of the gestures. There were a few times that I selected the wrong thing and ended up in the wrong app, but it was easy enough to navigate back to the home screen by simply pressing the Digital Crown.\n\nvisionOS allows you to open multiple apps and arrange them as you see fit. The interface for doing this is similar to Stage Manager on the iPad, with a “Window Bar” at the bottom of each app to adjust positioning and an arrow in the corner to adjust the size of each app. You can also bring windows closer to you by tapping with your fingers and pulling them closer.\n\nI was really impressed with how well Vision Pro was able to see my hands and respond to the gestures. I could have my hands resting on my lap, seemingly out of sight of the headset. Still, Vision Pro could pick up on any gestures and respond instantaneously.\n\nBut this is also a double-edged sword. One thing Apple explained to me is that there is a challenge to hand-control gestures because the headset has to be able to discern between intentional movements and unintentional movements. This is similar to something like an iPhone display or a Mac trackpad, where the software has to detect intentional vs unintentional movement.\n\nFor most people, that learning curve is going to be the most challenging aspect of Vision Pro. I have to imagine that the gestures become second nature at some point, but you’ll have to practice to get there. I’m assuming that visionOS will offer a robust user tutorial on the first run when it launches to customers next year. Apple will also offer demos at its retail stores for customers.\n\nContent consumption and environments\n\nApple is pitching content consumption as one of the biggest selling points of Vision Pro, and rightfully so. The experience is absolutely incredible. I had the chance to explore a 3D version of Avatar 2 and was blown away by the immersiveness.\n\nYou can watch content via Vision Pro in a floating window that you can adjust to your liking, and visionOS will automatically dim the area around that window. You can also put the movie in an environment of your choosing. I got to watch a movie using the Cinema Environment, which made it seem like I was watching in a dedicated home theater. The attention to detail was remarkable, down to acoustic-foam-style textures on the ceiling.\n\nWatching 3D movies with Vision Pro is proof that 3D movies can be incredibly immersive and downright cool if done right. 3D TVs may have been a short-lived fad, but Vision Pro nails the experience.\n\nI also got to watch a clip of an NBA game while wearing Vision Pro, as well as an MLB game. Both of these experiences were incredible. I could look up, down, left, and right and feel as if I was in the stadium, sitting courtside or right alongside the first base line. There was also a clip that was taken inside a music studio with Alicia Keys. I’ve written a lot about how concerts can be a big selling point of Vision Pro, and this demo only further proved that point to me.\n\nApple explained to me that every video I watched was shot in its own custom video format. It hopes that other companies will adopt this format, but as of right now, it had nothing to announce on this front beyond what it showcased with Disney during the keynote.\n\nAlong the side of the visionOS interface is a menu that expands to show “People, Apps, and Environments.” I chose the Environments option and saw one called “Mount Hood,” which was fully immersive and surrounded me on either side and behind me. This is also one of the times I used the Digital Crown to control my level of immersion. At any point, I could raise my hand it would appear on top of the mixed reality interface.\n\nPhotos\n\nThe Photos app is a key part of the Vision Pro experience. You can view your entire Photos library and use gestures to select photos, scroll between photos, zoom in and out, and more. You can view panoramic photos shot on iPhone that wrap all the way around you. I saw two different panoramic iPhone images that were taken in Iceland and on the Oregon coast.\n\nSpatial photos and videos are captured via the Vision Pro’s built-in 3D camera. Apple says these are meant to let users “capture, relive, and immerse themselves in favorite memories.”\n\n“Every spatial photo and video transports users back to a moment in time, like a celebration with friends or a special family gathering,” Apple explains.\n\nDuring my demo, I saw two spatial videos: one taken at a kid’s birthday party and another taken at a campfire. These were both very impressive and did a great job at making it feel as if I was in those memories myself. The demos were admittedly a bit creepy since these weren’t my memories, but it’s easy to see how incredible this feature will be when that changes.\n\nFaceTime\n\nDuring my hands-on time with Vision Pro, I took a FaceTime call from someone else in the building who was also wearing Vision Pro. This person was reflected in my Vision Pro view using a Persona, which Apple describes as a digital representation of the person created using machine learning techniques.\n\nThe Persona was very convincing, but once I started looking more closely, it was clear that it was an artificially generated video. This was especially noticeable around the person’s mouth.\n\nWhile on the FaceTime call, we collaborated on a Freeform document that included a 3D model of an apartment building. I could look inside that model to view specific details about the design, the corners, the furniture, and more. The 3D model took a while to load and was a bit buggy, which led to my overall mixed experience with FaceTime.\n\nComfort and motion sickness\n\nFinally, and perhaps most important, there’s the comfort aspect of Vision Pro. As I said at the beginning, the process of getting fitted and putting the headset on is straightforward and easy. But what about actually wearing it?\n\nI wore Vision Pro for about 30 minutes, and my experience was overall positive. The fabric is soft and breathable, there’s a lot of padding around the eyes, and it felt snug (but not too snug) on my head.\n\nThat being said, it’s definitely on the heavier side of things. I could absolutely see getting tired of wearing it after extended sessions. The overall design and fit reminded me quite a bit of AirPods Max and many of the materials were similar.\n\nIt’s clear why Apple opted for an external battery pack as well. If the battery pack was integrated into the headset itself, it would be way too heavy and virtually impossible to wear for more than a few minutes at a time.\n\nOne thing Apple said today is that it only had a small selection of the Light Seal sizes available during these demos. When Vision Pro launches, however, there will be a vast set of Light Seal sizes available. This will help further perfect the comfort for all users.\n\nGoing into today, I was really concerned about motion sickness while wearing an Apple headset. I get motion sick incredibly quickly in a car or an airplane. But in my 30 minutes wearing Vision Pro, I didn’t experience any motion sickness whatsoever.\n\nApple says that the combination of two 4K displays and incredibly low latency are big factors in preventing people from getting motion sick while wearing Vision Pro. The ability to move in and out of virtual reality and augmented reality also plays a major role in reducing motion sickness and fatigue.\n\nOther tidbits\n\nOne of the most impressive parts of my time with VIsion Pro was the sound quality. The headset features two individually amplified drivers inside each audio pod. Paired with the immersive content, Spatial Audio was stunning. Far better than Spatial Audio today using AirPods.\n\nI took part in a one-minute mindfulness meditation that featured immersive animations and guided breathing exercises. I definitely needed this after the two-hour keynote!\n\nOne of the demos saw me interact with a butterfly, which flew toward me and landed on my hand. There was also an Encounter Dinosaurs interactive experience, during which I walked toward the dinosaur and “touched it.” This was cool but a bit gimmicky. It’s a fun proof of concept for what could be possible in the future, though.\n\nI can’t speak to battery life since I only wore Vision Pro for 30 minutes. My headset was connected to the external battery pack, and it didn’t get in my way at all. I was able to get up and move around and just drop the battery pack into my pocket.\n\nI didn’t get to try any of the Mac-focused features, but I’m eager to learn more about those in the future.\n\nI didn’t get a chance to see anyone else wearing Vision Pro, so I didn’t get to see the EyeSight part of the experience.\n\nI saw an Apple Immersive Video demo that wrapped me in a 180-degree view as if I was flying above a city, under the ocean, in a field full of wildlife, and more.\n\nWrap-up\n\nWhen I took Vision Pro off after my 30-minute demo, I felt a bit discombobulated. Not necessarily in a bad way, but it was a feeling I’d never experienced before. I had just experienced something that transported me to another world… while also keeping me somewhat connected to the “real world” around me.\n\nThroughout my entire experience with Vision Pro, Apple repeatedly emphasized the various ways the headset keeps you connected to the world around you. For instance, I could look to my left and right to see the two other people in the demo room with me.\n\nAnother tell-tale sign of Apple’s goals is that nowhere in the press release does Apple even mention the word “headset.” The company instead refers to it as a “spatial computer” and refers to visionOS as “the world’s first spatial operating system.”\n\nThis is key to the Vision Pro experience, and it’s something that sets Apple apart from other players in this space. The hybrid of virtual and augmented reality strikes a really good balance of immersiveness while keeping you engaged with people around you.\n\nIn many ways, Vision Pro and visionOS are the culmination of years of AR and VR features that have gradually made their way to the iPhone since ARKit’s introduction in 2017. Apple says that the iPhone is already the largest AR platform in the world, and visionOS takes advantage of many of those features.\n\nDo some features of Vision Pro seem gimmicky? Absolutely. But much of what I saw today is proof of just how impressive mixed reality can be when it’s done right, using top-of-the-line hardware and software. As the ecosystem expands, some of the content that may seem gimmicky can be replaced with incredible experiences.\n\nThe hardware of Vision Pro is absolutely industry-leading. I couldn’t see a single pixel on the 4K displays, and even the edges of the content on either side of me were crisp and clear. The combination of those displays and the powerful M2 and R1 chips inside mean that Vision Pro excels at everything it does.\n\nVision Pro won’t be a runaway success, and I think even Apple knows that. The company likened the $3,500 price to that of the original Mac, which sold for $2,495 in 1984. In 2023 dollars, that would be over $7,000.\n\nBut even if there aren’t lines wrapping around Apple Stores on launch day, Vision Pro will give Apple a way to get its work in this market out into the wild. Developers can create apps, movie and TV studios can create content, and Apple can learn more about what people want from a product like this.\n\nI was a major skeptic of Apple’s plans to enter the VR/AR headset market. Vision Pro is still months away from being ready for prime time, but what I experienced during my hands-on today left me very impressed. I’m excited to see the final product sometime early next year.\n\nI’ll have more thoughts on visionOS and Vision Pro later this week when I answer some questions from 9to5Mac readers. Have anything you want to know? Let me down in the comments or on Twitter or Mastodon.\n\nFollow Chance: Twitter, Instagram, and Mastodon",

        "content": "Apple’s second major event of 2025, anticipated to take place in late October or early November, is already stirring excitement among tech enthusiasts. Following the September launch of the iPhone 17 series and new Apple Watch models, this event is expected to shift focus to updates in other key product categories, including AirPods, iPads, Vision Pro, and Apple TV. However, those eagerly awaiting updates to the MacBook and iMac lines may need to exercise patience, as these are rumored to be delayed until 2026 or beyond. Below is a detailed look at what could be unveiled during this much-anticipated event in a new video from Matt Talks Tech.\n\nAirPods Pro 3: A Leap in Wireless Audio\n\nFor fans of Apple’s wireless earbuds, the third-generation AirPods Pro is shaping up to be a highlight of the event. Expected to launch by the end of 2025, these earbuds could make their debut at the October event if not released earlier alongside the iPhone 17. While Apple has remained tight-lipped about specifics, industry insiders suggest significant upgrades in sound quality, noise cancellation, and battery life.\n\nMoreover, the AirPods Pro 3 may introduce features designed to enhance their integration within Apple’s ecosystem. For instance, seamless pairing with the Vision Pro headset and Apple TV could make these earbuds even more versatile, catering to both entertainment and productivity needs. These potential improvements could solidify the AirPods Pro 3 as a must-have accessory for Apple users.\n\niPad Pro with M5 Chip: Power and Precision\n\nThe iPad Pro is expected to receive a substantial performance boost with the introduction of the M5 chip, replacing the current M4 processor. While the external design is likely to remain familiar, rumors point to smaller bezels and slightly larger displays, offering a more immersive user experience. These enhancements are particularly appealing to professionals and creatives who rely on the iPad Pro for demanding tasks such as video editing, graphic design, and 3D rendering.\n\nWhen paired with the Magic Keyboard, the M5-powered iPad Pro could further solidify its position as a viable laptop alternative. This combination of power and portability is likely to resonate with users seeking a device capable of handling both work and entertainment seamlessly.\n\nVision Pro Update: Advancing Augmented Reality\n\nApple’s Vision Pro, the company’s flagship augmented reality headset, is rumored to receive a significant upgrade. The current M2 chip is expected to be replaced by the M5 processor, promising faster performance and smoother AR experiences. Other potential improvements include better battery life and increased RAM, addressing some of the limitations identified in the first-generation model.\n\nWhile the external design of the Vision Pro is unlikely to change, these internal enhancements could make the device more appealing to developers and early adopters. By improving its performance and usability, Apple aims to strengthen its position in the augmented reality market, paving the way for broader adoption of AR technology.\n\nApple TV: A17 Pro Chip for Superior Streaming\n\nStreaming enthusiasts have reason to be excited about the rumored updates to Apple TV. The device is expected to feature the A17 Pro chip or an even newer processor, delivering enhanced performance for 4K and HDR content. This upgrade could also improve gaming capabilities through Apple Arcade, making the Apple TV a more versatile entertainment hub.\n\nWith the growing popularity of streaming platforms and the increasing integration of smart home devices, the updated Apple TV could serve as a central hub for both entertainment and home automation. Its seamless compatibility with other Apple products further enhances its appeal, offering users a unified and intuitive experience.\n\nMacBook and iMac Updates: Delayed but Promising\n\nFans of Apple’s MacBook and iMac lines may need to wait a bit longer for updates to these products. The next-generation MacBooks, powered by the M5 chip, are now expected to launch in 2026, with OLED displays potentially arriving as late as 2027. While this delay may be disappointing, it suggests that Apple is taking extra time to refine these devices, making sure they deliver meaningful advancements when they finally debut.\n\nThis extended timeline could also indicate that Apple is working on integrating innovative features, such as improved battery technology or enhanced display capabilities, to set these devices apart from competitors. For now, users will need to rely on the current MacBook and iMac models, which remain highly capable despite the lack of recent updates.\n\nKey Takeaways from the October 2025 Event\n\nApple’s October 2025 event is shaping up to be a showcase of innovation, with a strong emphasis on the M5 chip and its integration across multiple product lines. Here’s a breakdown of what you can expect:\n\nAirPods Pro 3: Enhanced sound quality, noise cancellation, and battery life, with improved ecosystem compatibility.\n\nEnhanced sound quality, noise cancellation, and battery life, with improved ecosystem compatibility. iPad Pro: M5 chip, smaller bezels, and larger displays for a more immersive experience.\n\nM5 chip, smaller bezels, and larger displays for a more immersive experience.

        "content": "Apple’s entry into the earbuds and headphones segment with the first-generation AirPods was revolutionary for the brand and has allowed it to keep innovating. But the AirPods Max launched with a lot of promises and a heavy price tag, which even Apple purists found hard to justify. However, with positive reviews from tech enthusiasts and journalists, it has created a niche for itself in this ever-growing and competitive market. These are Apple’s first over-the-ear headphones, which excel in noise cancellation and audio quality, in typical Apple fashion.\n\nHead over to Best Buy to grab a pair of the Apple AirPods Max wireless headphones for just under $450 instead of their MSRP of $550. That’s a saving of $100, which is refreshing to see from Apple, which is stringent with discounts.\n\n## Why Buy The Apple AirPods Max?\n\n### Build\n\nFollowing the brand’s design language and build quality, this pair of headphones features a minimalistic design and an aluminum build, which feels premium and sturdy. The mesh lining of the headband allows ventilation for long sessions, while the ear cups sit snug on the ears. The clamping force is slightly on the higher side, so some users might feel fatigued after a while, but it’s not a deal-breaker. The cups are soft and comfortable, and you can replace them if they wear out. The crown on top of the right cup lets you adjust the volume, change tracks, and interact with incoming calls.\n\nWith a massive lineup of premium gaming headsets to choose from, which ones are the best for dual wireless audio?\n\n### Battery and Charging\n\nThis is the revamped version with new colors and, more importantly, a USB-C charging port rather than a Lightning one. It comes with a leather carrying case that features a polarizing design, effectively securing the ear cups. They last for about twenty hours on a single charge with the ANC turned on, and can gain 1.5 hours' worth of play if plugged in for only five minutes.\n\n### ANC and Transparency Mode\n\nThese have Apple’s accoustic noise-cancelling, which effectively cancels out loud ambient noises. This is especially helpful during commutes, as it can mask the sound of traffic and people. You can turn on/off the ANC using the dedicated button on the ear cup, located beside the digital crown. Transparency mode also works well, letting in more ambient sounds so you're aware of your surroundings even when listening to music, although you will hear a noticeable hissing sound due to the microphones working. This feature is useful if you don’t want to miss out on important sounds or announcements.\n\nThis selection of over-ear headphones delivers excellent ergonomics and comfort for those with glasses, along with advanced features like ANC.\n\n### Ecosystem\n\nThe headphones also take advantage of Apple’s cohesive ecosystem that allows you to effortlessly switch between Apple devices on the same iCloud account. If you’re already a part of the family, then investing in the AirPods Max makes more sense for you. Call audio quality is decent, but the microphone leaves a bit more to be desired.\n\n### Sound Quality\n\nThe biggest reason for anyone to consider this pair of headphones is its audio quality, which vastly justifies the price. The highs and lows are punchy and bass-heavy, and the audio adjusts itself depending on their placement on the ears. Spatial Audio mimics a stereo setup to give a multidimensional feel to the sounds.",

For the first time, Amazon ran the annual sales bonanza for 96 hours, but if you still managed to miss it, don't fret. You can always find deals on Amazon, especially when it comes to audio products. To wit, we've rounded up some decent discounts on a variety of earbuds.\n\n\n\n\n\nApple's AirPods 4, which are discounted to $89.99 at Amazon (30% off).

Yes, there were cheaper for Prime Day, but only by $0.99 (they were selling for $89 on the nose during the four-day Prime Day event).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are Apple's least expensive AirPods from the current generation lineup.

Powered by dual DACs and dual drivers, the Buds 4 are the flagship earbuds from OnePlus, with support for LHDC 5.0 (a high-resolution Bluetooth audio codec that supports 24-bit/192kHz audio streaming), as well as 3D Audio support and a Game Mode that OnePlus says will deliver \"47ms ultra-low latency\" to \"perfectly\" sync audio with the on-screen action while gaming.\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery life is rated for up to 10 hours by way of a 58mAh battery inside each earbud, and up to 45 hours with the included charging case adding another 520mAh of juice to the equation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are a few more deals on earbuds...",

        "content": "The market for mixed-reality headsets has been decidedly, well, mixed so far, but ByteDance seemingly thinks there’s room for growth.\n\nThe Information reports a subsidiary of the TikTok owner is working on a mixed-reality device that would layer objects over your real world view. Pico, which made the Pico 4 VR headset, is reportedly overseeing the creation of the goggles, which would compete with the Meta Quest and, to a lesser extent, Apple’s Vision Pro.\n\nUnlike Apple (and current Quest products), the Pico goggles are said to be small and lightweight, but aren’t blended into fashion devices, like Meta’s tie-in with Ray Ban and Oakley owner EssilorLuxottica or Snap’s AI Spectacles.\n\nByteDance and Pico are building “specialized chips for the device that will process data from its sensors to minimize the lag or latency between what a user sees in AR and their physical movements,” according to The Information. But many other details are still unknown.\n\nPricing hasn’t been discussed and it’s still uncertain if ByteDance will target the U.S. market with these goggles, assuming they’re ultimately released. Pico’s other headsets are not sold in North America and ByteDance and the Trump administration have an uneasy relationship at best. TikTok has already been banned by the U.S. government, but Trump has paused the enforcement of that ban several times, hoping to secure a U.S. buyer for the social network.\n\nOver two weeks ago, Trump said he had found a group of “very wealthy people” to buy TikTok, but has not yet revealed who they are (despite promising to do so). ByteDance has been resistant to selling TikTok and has not made any public statements about Trump’s claim.",

        "content": "In a trailblazing move, Apple has taken the wraps off its latest innovative product, the Vision Pro, marking its grand entry into the immersive world of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Much has been said about Apple's Vision Pro since its announcement, and the buzz is high about its potential to change the face of the AR and VR landscape. This article discusses the specifics of the device, its unique features, and what it could mean for the future of technology.\n\nIntroduction to Vision Pro\n\nApple's Vision Pro is designed to provide users with an unparalleled AR and VR experience, tapping into Apple's acclaimed design philosophy of seamless integration of software and hardware. Although the tech giant was not the first to enter the AR/VR space, it has certainly made a grand entrance. With a sleek design that doesn't compromise on comfort and a plethora of features that push the boundaries of what's possible with AR and VR, the Vision Pro is a testament to Apple's commitment to innovation.\n\nThe Vision Pro is a standalone device, which means that it can function independently without needing to be tethered to a computer or a console. This is a significant advantage as it offers users the freedom to move around and explore virtual spaces without any encumbrances. Additionally, the headset is designed with adjustable straps and cushioning for comfort, allowing for extended use without discomfort.\n\nImmerse, Interact, and Innovate\n\nAt the heart of the Vision Pro is its robust set of features, carefully crafted to deliver a seamless, immersive AR/VR experience. The device boasts high-resolution Retina displays that can seamlessly switch between AR and VR modes. In VR mode, the screens can provide a 3D experience by displaying two slightly different images to each eye, replicating depth perception.\n\nThe Vision Pro also includes a range of sensors to track the user's movement and the environment around them. The device's ultrawide cameras, for instance, allow for a broader field of view and contribute to a more immersive VR experience. Similarly, the headset's LIDAR scanner helps it understand and adapt to the user's physical environment in real-time.\n\nUnique to Vision Pro is Apple's application of advanced AI technologies, leveraging its own A-series chip to facilitate complex computations. This means the Vision Pro can understand and respond to a range of user gestures, enhancing interaction within the virtual environment. Furthermore, the device incorporates the tech giant's voice assistant, Siri, allowing for voice-controlled navigation and commands.\n\nBut perhaps one of the most striking features is Vision Pro's “pass-through mode.” In this mode, the Vision Pro's cameras capture the real-world view and display it on the inside of the headset. Users can then interact with the virtual world while still being aware of their physical surroundings.\n\nBridging Reality and Imagination\n\nThe Vision Pro offers an experience like no other, letting users engage with virtual objects as if they were in the real world. Whether it's exploring virtual landscapes, participating in interactive gaming, or engaging in professional applications like 3D modeling and design, the Vision Pro opens up a world of possibilities.\n\nThe device's spatial audio feature enhances this immersive experience. Using directional audio technology, it can simulate the sound coming from specific locations in the virtual environment, adding an extra layer of realism to the VR experience.\n\nMoreover, Apple has confirmed that Vision Pro will support its new RealityOS. This operating system has been developed specifically for AR and VR devices and will enable developers to create more immersive and interactive applications.\n\nWhere and How to Purchase the Apple Vision Pro\n\nThe highly-anticipated Apple Vision Pro, although announced, will not be hitting the shelves immediately. Apple has slated its release for “early next year,” creating a buzz of anticipation amongst technology enthusiasts worldwide. However, it's important to note that the groundbreaking technology encapsulated in the Vision Pro comes with a hefty price tag.\n\nPriced at a whopping $3,499, the Vision Pro is set to be one of the most expensive devices in its category, surpassing even the most skeptical cost predictions. While this price point may cause some prospective buyers to hesitate, it's a reflection of the innovative technology and superior user experience that Apple promises to deliver with this product. In the future, we shouldn't be surprised if Apple releases other versions of this technology at a lower price point, which could truly usher in the mass use of AR.\n\nIn line with its premium pricing, Apple is planning to provide an elevated purchasing experience for potential buyers. Customers will be able to book an appointment at an Apple Store, where they will be offered a demo of the Vision Pro and an opportunity to personalize their fit before making a purchase. This “red carpet treatment” mirrors the prestige of the Vision Pro, allowing customers to understand and appreciate the unique features and capabilities.\n\nThe combination of cutting-edge technology, an immersive user experience, and a luxurious purchasing journey positions the Apple Vision Pro as a high-end contender in the AR/VR market. For those considering a step into the future of AR and VR technology, the Vision Pro might just be the investment worth making.\n\nApple's Vision Pro and the AR/VR Landscape\n\nApple's Vision Pro is not just a product; it's a bold statement about the future of technology. The device's combination of advanced AI technology, a powerful operating system, and high-end hardware illustrates Apple's vision for the future of AR and VR.\n\nThe Vision Pro also showcases the significant potential of AR and VR technology across various sectors, including gaming, entertainment, education, and professional services. As the technology continues to evolve, and as developers create more applications and experiences for these platforms, devices like the Vision Pro will undoubtedly play a critical role in shaping the digital future.\n\nApple's Vision Pro is a revolutionary product that sets new standards in the AR and VR domain. With its potent combination of advanced features and user-friendly design, it promises to usher in a new era of immersive technology. It stands as a testament to Apple's innovative spirit and its relentless pursuit of creating technology that changes the world.",

        "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Apple Inc.\n\nApple recently unveiled its Vision Pro headset at the Worldwide Developers Conference in California. With it, Apple is venturing into a market of head-mounted devices (HMDs)—which are usually just displays, but in this case is more of a complete computer attached to your head—as well as the worlds of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR).\n\nThe new Apple product will fuel the hopes of many working on these technologies that they will some day be routinely used by the public, just as the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch helped bring smartphones, tablets and wearable tech into mainstream use.\n\nBut what does the Vision Pro actually do, and how much mass appeal will it have?\n\nVR immerses users in an entirely computer-generated world, isolating them to a large degree from their physical surroundings. AR superimposes computer-generated elements onto the real world while the latter remains visible, with the purpose of enhancing the context of our physical surroundings.\n\nA term often used interchangeably with AR is mixed reality, referring to a set of immersive technologies including AR, that provide different \"blends\" of physical and virtual worlds. These three technologies are often collectively referred to as XR.\n\nThe blending of VR and AR seems to be a key part of Apple's thinking, with the Vision Pro allowing users to adjust their level of immersion by deciding how much of the real world they can see. This transitioning between the two experiences will probably be a trend for future HMDs.\n\nThe physical world is \"seen\" through an array of 12 cameras located behind a ski-goggle-like glass fascia, acting as a lens. When the Vision Pro is in VR mode, people approaching you in the real world are automatically detected and displayed as they get close.\n\nA feature called EyeSight also displays the wearer's eyes through the glass lens when needed, to enable more natural interaction with people around them—a challenge for many HMDs.\n\nIn terms of technical specifications, the Vision Pro is impressive. It uses a combination of the M2 microchip and a new chip called the R1. M2 is running visionOS, which Apple calls its first spatial operating system, along with computer vision algorithms and computer graphics generation.\n\nR1 processes information from the cameras, an array of microphones and a LiDAR scanner—which uses a laser to measure distances to different objects—in order to make the headset aware of its surroundings.\n\nMore importantly, the Vision Pro boasts an impressive display system with \"more pixels than a 4K TV to each eye.\" Its ability to track where the wearer's eyes are looking allows users to interact with graphical elements just by looking at them. The headset can receive gesture and voice commands and features a form of 360-degree sound called spatial audio. The quoted unplugged operating time is two hours.\n\nWearable 'ecosystem'\n\nPacked, in typical Apple fashion, in curved aluminum and glass, the headset has an eye-watering price of US$3,499 (£2,819) and represents a collection of many premium features. But Apple has a history of developing products with increasingly versatile capabilities to sense what's going on in their real-world surroundings.\n\nApple also focuses on making its devices interoperable—meaning they work easily with other Apple devices—forming a wearable \"ecosystem.\" This is what really promises to be disruptive about the Vision Pro. It is also akin to what had been promised and hoped for by pioneers in the idea of wearable computing back in the 1990s.\n\nCombining the headset with the iPhone, which still forms the backbone of Apple's ecosystem, and the Apple Watch could help create new uses for augmented reality. Likewise, linking the headset to many programming tools demonstrates the company's desire to tap into an existing community of developers of augmented reality applications.\n\nMany questions remain, however. For example, will it be able to access mixed reality applications via a web browser? What will it be like to use from an ergonomic point of view?\n\nIt's also unclear when the Vision Pro be available outside the US or whether there will be a non-Pro version—as the \"Pro\" part of the title implies a more \"expert,\" or developer market.\n\nThe Vision Pro is a gamble, as XR is often seen as something that promises but rarely delivers. Yet, companies such as Apple and those that are probably its primary competitors in the XR domain, Meta and Microsoft, have the clout to make XR popular for the general public.\n\nMore importantly, devices such as the Vision Pro and its ecosystem, as well as its competitors could provide the foundation for developing the metaverse. This is an immersive world, facilitated by headsets, that aims for social interaction that's more natural than with previous products.\n\nSkeptics will say that Vision Pro and EyeSight make you appear like a scuba diver in your living room. But this could finally be the time to dive into the deep waters of XR.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.",

The device will be capable to toggling between virtual reality, or VR, and augmented reality, or AR, which projects digital imagery while users still see can see objects in the real world.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"This marks the beginning of a journey that will bring a new dimension to powerful personal technology,\" Cook told the crowd.\n\nAlthough Apple executives provided an extensive preview of the headset's capabilities during the final half hour of Monday's event, consumers will have to wait before they can get their hands on the device and prepare to pay a hefty price to boot. Vision Pro will sell for $3,500 once it's released in stores early next year.\n\n\"It's an impressive piece of technology, but it was almost like a tease,\" said Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen. \"It looked like the beginning of a very long journey.\"\n\nInstead of merely positioning the goggles as another vehicle for exploring virtual worlds or watching more immersive entertainment, Apple framed the Vision Pro as the equivalent of owning a ultrahigh-definition TV, surround-sound system, high-end camera, and state-of-the art camera bundled into a single piece of hardware.\n\n\"We believe it is a stretch, even for Apple, to assume consumers would pay a similar amount for an AR/VR headset as they would for a combination of those products,\" D.A. Davison Tom Forte wrote in a Monday research note.\n\nDespite such skepticism, the headset could become another milestone in Apple's lore of releasing game-changing technology, even though the company hasn't always been the first to try its hand at making a particular device.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nApple's lineage of breakthroughs date back to a bow-tied Jobs peddling the first Mac in 1984 —a tradition that continued with the iPod in 2001, the iPhone in 2007, the iPad in 2010, the Apple Watch in 2014 and its AirPods in 2016.\n\nThe company emphasized that it drew upon its past decades of product design during the years it spent working on the Vision Pro, which Apple said involved more than 5,000 different patents.\n\nThe headset will be equipped with 12 cameras, six microphones and variety of sensors that will allow users to control it and various apps with just their eyes and hand gestures. Apple said the experience won't cause the recurring nausea and headaches that similar devices have in the past. The company also developed a technology to create three-dimensional digital version of each user to display during video conferencing.\n\nAlthough Vision Pro won't require physical controllers that can be clunky to use, the goggles will have to either be plugged into a power outlet or a portable battery tethered to the headset — a factor that could make it less attractive for some users.\n\n\"They've worked hard to make this headset as integrated into the real world as current technology allows, but it's still a headset,\" said Insider Intelligence analyst Yory Wurmser, who nevertheless described the unveiling as a \"fairly mind-blowing presentation.\"\n\nEven so, analysts are not expecting the Vision Pro to be a big hit right away. That's largely because of the hefty price, but also because most people still can't see a compelling reason to wear something wrapped around their face for an extended period of time.\n\nIf the Vision Pro turns out to be a niche product, it would leave Apple in the same bind as other major tech companies and startups that have tried selling headsets or glasses equipped with technology that either thrusts people into artificial worlds or projects digital images onto scenery and things that are actually in front of them — a format known as \"augmented reality.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been describing these alternate three-dimensional realities as the \"metaverse.\" It's a geeky concept that he tried to push into the mainstream by changing the name of his social networking company to Meta Platforms in 2021 and then pouring billions of dollars into improving the virtual technology.\n\nBut the metaverse largely remains a digital ghost town, although Meta's virtual reality headset, the Quest, remains the top-selling device in a category that so far has mostly appealed to video game players looking for even more immersive experiences. Cook and other Apple executives avoided referring to the metaverse in their presentations, describing the Vision Pro as the company's first leap into \"spatial computing\" instead.\n\nThe response to virtual, augmented and mixed reality has been decidedly ho-hum so far. Some of the gadgets deploying the technology have even been derisively mocked, with the most notable example being Google's internet-connected glasses released more than a decade ago.\n\nMicrosoft also has had limited success with HoloLens, a mixed-reality headset released in 2016, although the software maker earlier this year insisted it remains committed to the technology.\n\nMagic Leap, a startup that stirred excitement with previews of a mixed-reality technology that could conjure the spectacle of a whale breaching through a gymnasium floor, had so much trouble marketing its first headset to consumers in 2018 that it has since shifted its focus to industrial, health care and emergency uses.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives estimated Apple will sell just 150,000 of the headsets during its first year on the market before escalating to 1 million headsets sold during the second year — a volume that would make the goggles a mere speck in the company's portfolio.\n\nBy comparison, Apple sells more than 200 million of its marquee iPhones a year. But the iPhone wasn't an immediate sensation, with sales of fewer than 12 million units in its first full year on the market.",

        "content": "For a limited time, Amazon has brought back the best AirPods 4 deal that we saw during Prime Day. Right now you can pick up Apple AirPods 4 Earbuds with Active Noise Cancelation for just $119.99 with free shipping. Currently the AirPods Pro retails for $169, or $50 more. Both earbuds offer active noise cancelation and seamless synching with your iPhone, but they wear, feel, and sound very differently.\n\nThe Apple AirPods 4 is an open air earbud design\n\nThe Apple AirPods 4 was released on September, 2024 in two variants: one with noise canceling and one without. This is an open air earbud design, which means it doesn't sit inside and seal your ear canal. Normally this style isn't ideal for noise canceling purposes since there is no effective means of providing passive noise isolation. However, somehow Apple did it; the noise canceling feature here is actually quite excellent. The AirPods 4 also features several other updates over the AirPods 3, including an upgraded Apple H2 chip, Bluetooth 5.3 support, IP54 resistance rating which now protects against dust intrusion, USB Type-C charging, and an optical in-ear sensor.\n\nShould you get the AirPods 4 with ANC or the AirPods Pro?\n\nThe AirPods 4 with active noise cancelation is quite different from the more expensive AirPods Pro 2 because of the way it is worn: the AirPods 4 is an open-ear earbud with non-adjustable tips that sits just outside your ear canal, whereas the AirPods Pro is an in-ear earbud that sits inside and seals your ear canal with adjustable tips. Which AirPods is a better fit for you depends on your priorities. In-ear earbuds provide passive noise isolation, which direct correlates with better audio quality and noise canceling. Open-ear earbuds are less intrusive, are generally more comfortable, and allow you to be more aware of your surroundings. Of course, price is a factor too. The AirPods 4 is $50 cheaper right now.\n\nEric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

But how much will the Apple Vision Pro cost?\n\nApple Vision Pro will retail for $3,499, and it will be available for purchase in early 2024.\n\nFor comparison, Meta announced its Quest 3 last week at the price point of $499, while its Quest 2 is retailing for $299. But Meta’s high-performance headset launched with a $1,499 price tag, though it seems like it’s available for $999 at a number of retailers.\n\nUnlike Meta’s headsets, the Apple Vision Pro uses augmented reality rather than virtual reality. The difference is that augmented reality is less immersive, allowing users to take advantage of the technology without being completely divorced from their surroundings. Plus, the Apple Vision Pro uses hand tracking as a control, eliminating the need to have separate handheld devices.\n\nSimilar to the Meta Quest Pro, Apple is advertising this device to be used in part for the workplace — its visionOS runs on the same framework as iOS and iPadOS, meaning it will be compatible with many existing apps. But already, Apple says that the headset will work with Microsoft Office apps, as well as video conferencing services like WebEX and Zoom.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

        "content": "Apple on Monday unveiled a long-rumored headset that will place its users between the virtual and real worlds, while also testing the technology trendsetter’s ability to popularize newfangled devices after others failed to capture the public’s imagination.\n\nAfter years of speculation, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook hailed the arrival of the sleek goggles — dubbed Vision Pro — at the company’s annual developers conference, held on a park-like campus here that Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs helped design. The device will be capable of toggling between virtual reality, or VR, and augmented reality, or AR, which projects digital imagery while users still can see objects in the real world.\n\n“This marks the beginning of a journey that will bring a new dimension to powerful personal technology,” Cook told the crowd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Apple executives provided an extensive preview of the headset’s capabilities during the final half-hour of Monday’s event, consumers will have to wait before they can get their hands on the device — and prepare to pay a hefty price to boot. Vision Pro will sell for $3,500 once it’s released in stores early next year.\n\n“It’s an impressive piece of technology, but it was almost like a tease,” Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen said. “It looked like the beginning of a very long journey.”\n\nInstead of merely positioning the goggles as another vehicle for exploring virtual worlds or watching more immersive entertainment, Apple framed the Vision Pro as the equivalent of owning an ultrahigh-definition TV, surround-sound system, high-end camera and state-of-the-art camera bundled into a single piece of hardware.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We believe it is a stretch, even for Apple, to assume consumers would pay a similar amount for an AR/VR headset as they would for a combination of those products,” D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a Monday research note.\n\nDespite such skepticism, the headset could become another milestone in Apple’s lore of releasing game-changing technology, even though the company hasn’t always been the first to try its hand at making a particular device.\n\nVoices Column: Two Uber drivers read the fine print — and won millions for California gig workers After Uber and other gig giants failed to pay a mandated rate hike, two eagle-eyed drivers started asking questions — and won a jackpot for California gig workers.\n\nApple’s lineage of breakthroughs dates to a bow-tied Jobs peddling the first Mac in 1984 — a tradition that continued with the iPod in 2001, the iPhone in 2007, the iPad in 2010, the Apple Watch in 2014 and its AirPods in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company emphasized that it drew upon its previous decades of product design during the years it spent working on the Vision Pro, which Apple said involved more than 5,000 patents. The goggles will be equipped with 12 cameras, six microphones and a variety of sensors that will allow users to control it and various apps with just their eyes and hands. Apple also developed a technology to create a 3-D digital version of each user to display during video conferencing.\n\nAlthough Vision Pro won’t require physical controllers that can be clunky to use, the goggles will have to be plugged into either a power outlet or a portable battery tethered to the headset — a factor that could make it less attractive for some users.\n\n“They’ve worked hard to make this headset as integrated into the real world as current technology allows, but it’s still a headset,” said Insider Intelligence analyst Yory Wurmser, who nevertheless described the unveiling as a “fairly mind-blowing presentation.”\n\nEven so, analysts are not expecting the Vision Pro to be a big hit right away. That’s largely because of the hefty price, but also because most people still can’t see a compelling reason to wear something wrapped around their face for an extended period.\n\nIf the new device turns out to be a niche product, it would leave Apple in the same bind as other major tech companies and startups that have tried selling headsets or glasses equipped with technology that thrusts people into artificial worlds or projects digital images with scenery and things that are actually in front of them.\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been describing these alternate 3-D realities as the “metaverse.” It’s a geeky concept that he tried to push into the mainstream by changing the name of his social networking company to Meta Platforms in 2021 and then pouring billions of dollars into improving the virtual technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the metaverse largely remains a digital ghost town, although Meta’s virtual reality headset, the Quest, remains the top-selling device in a category that has mostly appealed to video game players looking for even more immersive experiences. Cook and other Apple executives avoided referring to the metaverse in their presentations, describing the Vision Pro as the company’s first leap into “spatial computing” instead.\n\nThe response to virtual, augmented and mixed reality has been decidedly ho-hum. Some of the gadgets deploying the technology have been derisively mocked, with the most notable example being Google’s internet-connected glasses released more than a decade ago.\n\nAfter Google co-founder Sergey Brin initially drummed up excitement about the device by demonstrating an early model’s potential “wow factor” with a skydiving stunt staged during a San Francisco tech conference, consumers quickly became turned off to a product that allowed its users to surreptitiously take pictures and video. The backlash became so intense that people who wore the gear became known as “Glassholes,” leading Google to withdraw the product a few years after its debut.\n\nMicrosoft also has had limited success with HoloLens, a mixed-reality headset released in 2016, although the software maker earlier this year insisted it remains committed to the technology.\n\nMagic Leap, a startup that stirred excitement with previews of a mixed-reality technology that could conjure the spectacle of a whale breaching through a gymnasium floor, had so much trouble marketing its first headset to consumers in 2018 that it has since shifted its focus to industrial, healthcare and emergency uses.\n\nDaniel Diez, Magic Leap’s chief transformation officer, said there are four major questions Apple’s goggles will have to answer: “What can people do with it? What does this thing look and feel like? Is it comfortable to wear? And how much is it going to cost?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoices Column: How tech is changing L.A. — and how L.A. is changing tech Increasingly offering products untethered to the average consumer’s needs, the tech industry has been dwelling in La La Land. Its real-world expansion into L.A. is no coincidence.\n\nThe anticipation that Apple’s goggles are going to sell for several thousand dollars already has dampened expectations for the product.\n\nAlthough he expects Apple’s goggles to boast “jaw dropping” technology, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said he expects the company to sell just 150,000 units during the device’s first year on the market — a mere speck in the company’s portfolio.\n\nBy comparison, Apple sells more than 200 million of its marquee iPhones a year. But the iPhone wasn’t an immediate sensation, with sales of fewer than 12 million units in its first full year on the market.\n\nSince 2016, the average annual shipments of virtual- and augmented-reality devices have averaged 8.6 million units, according to the research firm CCS Insight. The firm expects sales to remain sluggish this year, with a sales projection of about 11 million of the devices before gradually climbing to 67 million in 2026.\n\nBefore taking the wraps of its new goggles, Apple kicked off the event by announcing that the latest models of two high-end computer lines, the Mac Studio and Mac Pro, will be powered by a company-designed chip that has already been available in less-expensive Macs.\n\nThe Mac Studio will sell for $2,000 and the Mac Pro will be priced at $7,000. As it typically does at this conference, Apple provided a peek at the next iPhone operating system, iOS 17. That software, which will include more personalization and location-sharing tools for phone calls and texting, is expected to be released as a free update in September.",

        "content": "Apple 's mixed reality headset debut marks a \"watershed moment\" for the industry, said the executives of some major players in the augmented and virtual reality space as they welcomed competition for the U.S. tech giant.\n\nApple launched its Vision Pro headset at its annual WWDC event Monday, ending months of speculation that the Cupertino, California, tech giant was getting ready to launch its own VR or augmented reality product.\n\nCher Wang, CEO of Taiwanese tech giant HTC, told CNBC that she sees Apple's move as a validation for the industry. HTC has long been a mainstay of the virtual and augmented industry, pivoting from its ailing smartphone business several years ago to focus on its Vive headsets division.\n\n\"Apple's entry into the market is a watershed moment for the industry, and a big validation of everything HTC VIVE has been working on,\" she told CNBC. \"This will bring even more confidence in the global market for VR.\"\n\nHowever, she added that the \"closed\" nature of Apple's services ecosystem — which is more restrictive when it comes to the platforms and devices through which users access its services — is problematic.\n\n\"Apple has historically used a closed ecosystem for their iOS products and content distribution platforms, which could be limiting for developers in a new value chain. If developers are locked into one ecosystem, it's difficult for them to maximize their reach.\"\n\nApple says the Vision Pro will allow users to see apps in a new way in the spaces around them. Users can use their eyes and hands to navigate through apps and search with their voices.\n\nWith the headset, users can watch movies, including in 3D with spatial audio, view their own pictures or videos, and play video games. It can also be used for work through videoconferencing apps such as Microsoft Office tools and Adobe Lightroom.\n\nVision Pro will run on visionOS, a new spatial computing platform designed specifically for the company's new headset to enable developers to build apps like they would for iOS on the iPhone. It will be available starting at $3,499 beginning early next year.",

        "content": "# Apple Announces Vision Pro AR/VR Headset: How Will it Impact the Metaverse?\n\nAt the Apple WWDC 2203 event taking place today, the company launched its brand new AR/VR headset, the Vision Pro. It has the potential to massively impact the metaverse. Moreover, the company has long-held plans to dive into the world of augmented reality.\n\nThe product’s arrival has been considered the most exciting since the Apple Watch launched in 2015. Moreover, it has the potential to completely change the usage and adoption of augmented reality. Subsequently, as it is set to compete with Meta Quest and other massive VR headsets, Apple could be poised to have an even bigger impact on the metaverse.\n\n## Apple AR/VR Headset\n\nWhen it was first introduced, virtual reality was thought to be the next evolution of the internet. Subsequently, it saw a host of companies embrace the change, and develop a way for them to capitalize. Mark Zuckerberg shifted the focus of his brand, and from Facebook, Meta was born.\n\nYet Apple has officially launched its new Vision Pro AR/VR headset, which could truly change the market and have an undeniable impact on the metaverse as we know it. The product is a brand-new headset integrated with some of Apple’s most popular applications. It is priced at $3,499.\n\nMoreover, Apple CEO Tim Cook notes that you can control it with your hands, eyes, or voice. Specifically, the product will be able to track your eyes and highlight an icon from the device’s home screen. Subsequently, the announcement revealed that applications like Disney+ would be available from day one.\n\nAdditionally, the product features impressive capabilities, like the new EyeSight technology. This feature allows external individuals to see the user’s eyes. Indeed, it can also signal whether the user is busy or not. While also allowing you to observe when someone enters your field of view in the mixed-reality product.\n\n## More Apple AR/VR Headset Features\n\nApple also announced a new biometrics system called Optic ID for Apple Vision Pro. It analyzes your iris to identify you. This is similar to how Face ID works for your whole face on iPhone. The headset runs on visionOS, which has a foundation on iOS. The UI is brand new, with a spatial 3D interface and a floating app grid home screen.\n\nApple has been working on developing technologies and producing them for the mainstream consumer for a long time. Conversely, rumors have been swirling for a long time, but there has been no announcement until now.\n\nApple’s WWDC 2023 saw the company finally announce this impressive product. However, there is still wonder as to when it could reach the market.

Speaking to The Verge, the CEO of the VR/AR platform Campfire 3D noted his excitement. “This is the single greatest thing that could happen to this industry,” Wright stated. “Whether you make hardware or software, we’re excited about it.”\n\n# Apple Announces Vision Pro AR/VR Headset: How Will it Impact the Metaverse?\n\nAt the Apple WWDC 2203 event taking place today, the company launched its brand new AR/VR headset, the Vision Pro. It has the potential to massively impact the metaverse. Moreover, the company has long-held plans to dive into the world of augmented reality.\n\nThe product’s arrival has been considered the most exciting since the Apple Watch launched in 2015. Moreover, it has the potential to completely change the usage and adoption of augmented reality. Subsequently, as it is set to compete with Meta Quest and other massive VR headsets, Apple could be poised to have an even bigger impact on the metaverse.\n\n## Apple AR/VR Headset\n\nWhen it was first introduced, virtual reality was thought to be the next evolution of the internet. Subsequently, it saw a host of companies embrace the change, and develop a way for them to capitalize. Mark Zuckerberg shifted the focus of his brand, and from Facebook, Meta was born.\n\nYet Apple has officially launched its new Vision Pro AR/VR headset, which could truly change the market and have an undeniable impact on the metaverse as we know it. The product is a brand-new headset integrated with some of Apple’s most popular applications. It is priced at $3,499.\n\nMoreover, Apple CEO Tim Cook notes that you can control it with your hands, eyes, or voice. Specifically, the product will be able to track your eyes and highlight an icon from the device’s home screen. Subsequently, the announcement revealed that applications like Disney+ would be available from day one.\n\nAdditionally, the product features impressive capabilities, like the new EyeSight technology. This feature allows external individuals to see the user’s eyes. Indeed, it can also signal whether the user is busy or not. While also allowing you to observe when someone enters your field of view in the mixed-reality product.\n\n## More Apple AR/VR Headset Features\n\nApple also announced a new biometrics system called Optic ID for Apple Vision Pro. It analyzes your iris to identify you. This is similar to how Face ID works for your whole face on iPhone. The headset runs on visionOS, which has a foundation on iOS. The UI is brand new, with a spatial 3D interface and a floating app grid home screen.\n\nApple has been working on developing technologies and producing them for the mainstream consumer for a long time. Conversely, rumors have been swirling for a long time, but there has been no announcement until now.\n\nApple’s WWDC 2023 saw the company finally announce this impressive product. However, there is still wonder as to when it could reach the market. Many have rumored when it could become available, but one thing is certain: it could be the company’s first foray into the metaverse.\n\n## Apple Entering The Metaverse?\n\nAs we’ve previously stated, the metaverse has long been hyped as the internet’s next evolution.

        "content": "June 5, 2023\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nIntroducing Apple Vision Pro: Apple’s first spatial computer\n\nCUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today unveiled Apple Vision Pro, a revolutionary spatial computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, while allowing users to stay present and connected to others. Vision Pro creates an infinite canvas for apps that scales beyond the boundaries of a traditional display and introduces a fully three-dimensional user interface controlled by the most natural and intuitive inputs possible — a user’s eyes, hands, and voice. Featuring visionOS, the world’s first spatial operating system, Vision Pro lets users interact with digital content in a way that feels like it is physically present in their space. The breakthrough design of Vision Pro features an ultra-high-resolution display system that packs 23 million pixels across two displays, and custom Apple silicon in a unique dual-chip design to ensure every experience feels like it’s taking place in front of the user’s eyes in real time.\n\n“Today marks the beginning of a new era for computing,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Just as the Mac introduced us to personal computing, and iPhone introduced us to mobile computing, Apple Vision Pro introduces us to spatial computing. Built upon decades of Apple innovation, Vision Pro is years ahead and unlike anything created before — with a revolutionary new input system and thousands of groundbreaking innovations. It unlocks incredible experiences for our users and exciting new opportunities for our developers.”\n\n“Creating our first spatial computer required invention across nearly every facet of the system,” said Mike Rockwell, Apple’s vice president of the Technology Development Group. “Through a tight integration of hardware and software, we designed a standalone spatial computer in a compact wearable form factor that is the most advanced personal electronics device ever.”\n\nExtraordinary New Experiences\n\nApple Vision Pro brings a new dimension to powerful, personal computing by changing the way users interact with their favorite apps, capture and relive memories, enjoy stunning TV shows and movies, and connect with others in FaceTime.\n\nAn infinite canvas for apps at work and at home: visionOS features a three-dimensional interface that frees apps from the boundaries of a display so they can appear side by side at any scale. Apple Vision Pro enables users to be even more productive, with infinite screen real estate, access to their favorite apps, and all-new ways to multitask. And with support for Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, users can set up the perfect workspace or bring the powerful capabilities of their Mac into Vision Pro wirelessly, creating an enormous, private, and portable 4K display with incredibly crisp text.\n\nEngaging entertainment experiences: With two ultra-high-resolution displays, Apple Vision Pro can transform any space into a personal movie theater with a screen that feels 100 feet wide and an advanced Spatial Audio system. Users can watch movies and TV shows, or enjoy stunning three-dimensional movies. Apple Immersive Video offers 180-degree high-resolution recordings with Spatial Audio, and users can access an exciting lineup of immersive videos that transport them to entirely new places.\n\nSpatial computing makes new types of games possible with titles that can span a spectrum of immersion and bring gamers into all-new worlds. Users can also play over 100 Apple Arcade games on a screen as large as they want, with incredible immersive audio and support for popular game controllers.\n\nImmersive Environments: With Environments, a user’s world can grow beyond the dimensions of a physical room with dynamic, beautiful landscapes that can help them focus or reduce clutter in busy spaces. A twist of the Digital Crown lets a user control how present or immersed they are in an environment.\n\nMemories come alive: Featuring Apple’s first three-dimensional camera, Apple Vision Pro lets users capture, relive, and immerse themselves in favorite memories with Spatial Audio. Every spatial photo and video transports users back to a moment in time, like a celebration with friends or a special family gathering. Users can access their entire photo library on iCloud, and view their photos and videos at a life-size scale with brilliant color and spectacular detail. Every Panorama shot on iPhone expands and wraps around the user, creating the sensation they are standing right where it was taken.\n\nFaceTime becomes spatial: With Apple Vision Pro, FaceTime calls take advantage of the room around the user, with everyone on the call reflected in life-size tiles, as well as Spatial Audio, so it sounds as if participants are speaking right from where they are positioned. Users wearing Vision Pro during a FaceTime call are reflected as a Persona — a digital representation of themselves created using Apple’s most advanced machine learning techniques — which reflects face and hand movements in real time. Users can do things together like watch a movie, browse photos, or collaborate on a presentation.\n\nEven more app experiences: Apple Vision Pro has an all-new App Store where users can discover apps and content from developers, and access hundreds of thousands of familiar iPhone and iPad apps that run great and automatically work with the new input system for Vision Pro. Apple’s developer community can go even further and take advantage of the powerful and unique capabilities of Vision Pro and visionOS to design brand-new app experiences, and reimagine existing ones for spatial computing.\n\nA Revolutionary Operating System and User Interface\n\nBuilt on the foundation of decades of engineering innovation in macOS, iOS, and iPadOS, visionOS was designed from the ground up to support the low-latency requirements of spatial computing. The result is a revolutionary operating system that delivers powerful spatial experiences that can take advantage of the space around the user, unlocking new opportunities at work and at home.\n\nvisionOS features a brand-new three-dimensional interface that makes digital content look and feel present in a user’s physical world. By responding dynamically to natural light and casting shadows, it helps the user understand scale and distance. To enable user navigation and interaction with spatial content, Apple Vision Pro introduces an entirely new input system controlled by a person’s eyes, hands, and voice. Users can browse through apps by simply looking at them, tapping their fingers to select, flicking their wrist to scroll, or using voice to dictate.\n\nApple Vision Pro also features EyeSight, an extraordinary innovation that helps users stay connected with those around them. When a person approaches someone wearing Vision Pro, the device feels transparent — letting the user see them while also displaying the user’s eyes. When a user is immersed in an environment or using an app, EyeSight gives visual cues to others about what the user is focused on.\n\nBreakthrough Design\n\nApple Vision Pro builds on Apple innovation and experience designing high-performance products like Mac, iPhone, and wearables like Apple Watch, culminating in the most advanced personal electronics device ever. To achieve ambitious goals for performance, mobility, and wearability, Apple utilized the most advanced materials possible.\n\nApple Vision Pro has an astonishing amount of technology in a compact design. A singular piece of three-dimensionally formed and laminated glass is polished to create an optical surface that acts as a lens for the wide array of cameras and sensors needed to blend the physical world with digital content. The glass flows into the custom aluminum alloy frame that gently curves around the user’s face, while the modular system allows for a tailored fit to accommodate a wide range of people. The Light Seal is made of a soft textile, and comes in a range of shapes and sizes, flexing to conform to a user’s face for a precise fit. Flexible straps ensure audio remains close to the user’s ears, while a Head Band — available in multiple sizes — is three-dimensionally knitted as a single piece to provide cushioning, breathability, and stretch.1 The band is secured with a simple mechanism, making it easy to change to another size or style of band.\n\nUnrivaled Innovation in Hardware\n\nApple Vision Pro is designed to deliver phenomenal compute performance in a compact wearable form factor. Featuring a breakthrough ultra-high-resolution display system built on top of an Apple silicon chip, Vision Pro uses micro-OLED technology to pack 23 million pixels into two displays, each the size of a postage stamp, with wide color and high dynamic range. This technological breakthrough, combined with custom catadioptric lenses that enable incredible sharpness and clarity, delivers jaw-dropping experiences. Users with vision correction needs will use ZEISS Optical Inserts to ensure visual fidelity and eye tracking accuracy.2\n\nAn advanced Spatial Audio system is core to the Apple Vision Pro experience, creating the feeling that sounds are coming from the environment around the user and matching the sound to the space. Two individually amplified drivers inside each audio pod deliver Personalized Spatial Audio based on the user’s own head and ear geometry.3\n\nIn addition to creating a breakthrough display and advanced audio experiences, the high-performance eye tracking system in Apple Vision Pro uses high-speed cameras and a ring of LEDs that project invisible light patterns onto the user’s eyes for responsive, intuitive input.\n\nThese groundbreaking innovations are powered by Apple silicon in a unique dual-chip design. M2 delivers unparalleled standalone performance, while the brand-new R1 chip processes input from 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones to ensure that content feels like it is appearing right in front of the user’s eyes, in real time. R1 streams new images to the displays within 12 milliseconds — 8x faster than the blink of an eye. Apple Vision Pro is designed for all-day use when plugged in, and up to two hours of use with its external, high-performance battery.\n\nIndustry-Leading Privacy and Security\n\nApple Vision Pro is built on a strong foundation of privacy and security, and keeps users in control of their data.\n\nOptic ID is a new secure authentication system that analyzes a user’s iris under various invisible LED light exposures, and then compares it to the enrolled Optic ID data that is protected by the Secure Enclave to instantly unlock Apple Vision Pro. A user’s Optic ID data is fully encrypted, is not accessible to apps, and never leaves their device, meaning it is not stored on Apple servers.\n\nWhere a user looks stays private while navigating Apple Vision Pro, and eye tracking information is not shared with Apple, third-party apps, or websites. Additionally, data from the camera and other sensors is processed at the system level, so individual apps do not need to see a user’s surroundings to enable spatial experiences. EyeSight also includes a visual indicator that makes it clear to others when a user is capturing a spatial photo or video.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nApple Vision Pro starts at $3,499 (U.S.), and will be available early next year on apple.com and at Apple Store locations in the U.S., with more countries coming later next year. Customers will be able to learn about, experience, and personalize their fit for Vision Pro at Apple Store locations. For more information about Vision Pro, visit apple.com/apple-vision-pro.\n\nAccessories are sold separately. ZEISS Optical Inserts are sold separately.

The product, which has a hefty price tag of $3,499, marks the iPhone maker’s foray into augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR), a field Apple’s Big Tech rivals, including Google and Meta, have already entered with middling success.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook said at WWDC that the Vision Pro will “shift the way we look at technology and the role it plays in our lives.”\n\n“The depth of engineering in it is mind-blowing. You’ve got more than a 4k experience in each eye,” Cook said in an interview on Good Morning America the next day. “It enables you to see, hear and interact with digital content right in your physical spaces as if it’s there.”\n\nThe Vision Pro won’t be available until 2024, so most consumers haven’t had the opportunity to interact with the device. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, whose companies have both introduced similar AR/VR products, have expressed mixed opinions about Apple’s highest-profile new product in nearly a decade.\n\nSundar Pichai: Vision Pro has the potential to create computing experiences beyond smartphones.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg yesterday (June 12), Pichai said he’s excited about the potential of new AR/VR devices like the Vision Pro to create more immersive computing experiences. He added that Google has “always felt computing will evolve beyond the black rectangles,” referring to today’s smartphones.\n\nGoogle is one of the earliest tech companies to enter the AR/VR space. In 2013, it released the $1,500 Google Glass, an AR headset equipped with a camera that could capture the user’s surroundings. But the product failed to catch on in both the consumer market or the enterprise market. In March, the company announced it will officially discontinue Google Glass.\n\nInstead of hardware, Google in recent years has focused its AR/VR strategy on apps, such as Google Lens and Google Arts and Culture.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Apple and Meta have a “philosophical difference” in approaching VR.\n\nThe closest competitor of the Vision Pro in today’s market is Meta’s Quest line of AR/VR headsets. But Meta CEO Zuckerberg said Apple has a fundamentally different approach to AR/VR and suggested its product caters to a different audience.\n\n“From what I’ve seen initially, I’d say the good news is that there’s no kind of magical solutions that they have to any of the constraints on laws of physics that our teams haven’t already explored and thought of,” Zuckerberg told Meta employees in an all-hands meeting on June 8.\n\nZuckerberg acknowledged the Vision Pro has a higher-resolution display, but pointed out the device is seven times more expensive than Meta’s upcoming $499 Quest 3, which was unveiled days before Apple’s WWDC event.\n\n“I think that their announcement really showcases the difference in the values and the vision that our companies bring to this,” the Meta CEO said. “We innovate to make sure that our products are as accessible and affordable to everyone as possible, and that is a core part of what we do. And we have sold tens of millions of Quests.”\n\n“More importantly, our vision for the metaverse and presence is fundamentally social,” Zuckerberg added. “Our device is also about being active and doing things. By contrast, every demo that they showed was a person sitting on a couch by themself…That could be the vision of the future of computing, but like, it’s not the one that I want.”",

        "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University\n\nVirtual reality and augmented reality headsets are still niche products, mostly used by gamers.\n\nHowever, with the announcements of the release of Meta's Quest 3 headset and Apple's Vision Pro, Northeastern experts believe the industry that has struggled to gain ground in the mainstream is making incremental steps in moving the technology forward.\n\nThe average person is not ready to change how they interact with computers, says Blair MacIntyre, a professor at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University.\n\n\"But that said, I don't think (the industry) is dying,\" Blair says. \"I think it's sort of stagnating.\"\n\nThe industry is growing, according to Statista, with the global VR market size projected to increase from less than $12 billion in 2022 to more than $22 billion by 2025.\n\nHowever, AR and VR devices still aren't quite as in-demand as other electronics like smartphones or smartwatches. But many companies such as Microsoft, Google, Intel and Sony have all invested in the technology, showcasing there is still some potential.\n\nIn 2022, 14.94 million of these devices shipped globally, a 54% increase from 2021's 9.69 million. Most of these were VR devices, representing 91% of the total number of VR and AR devices expected to be shipped out last year.\n\nHowever, there are still some downsides in the headsets, says Wallace Lages, assistant professor at Northeastern. For example, if the tracking system isn't good, the image the user sees will not correspond with their movements, making them feel sick with nausea or headaches. Or, as Langes put it, \"cybersickness.\"\n\nHeadsets also can be heavy, says Lages, making users not want to wear them for long periods.\n\nIt is also a large leap for someone who is used to sitting on the couch watching TV or on their phones on social media to putting on a headset and going into a 3D world, says MacIntyre.\n\nBut, there are niche cases where virtual reality is useful, such as management training, exposure therapy or practicing surgical procedures.\n\n\"VR isn't going to go away and because of those things, I think, only gets better,\" says MacIntyre. \"The augmented reality side is still frustratingly far away in many cases.\"\n\nLast week Meta announced the Quest 3 headset, with pricing starting at $499. The company says it will feature color mixed reality, combining VR and AR elements.\n\nOn Monday, Apple announced another mixed-use headset called Apple Vision Pro. The device is controller-free, and you browse rows of app icons in an operating system called visionOS by looking at them. You can tap to select and flick to scroll, and also give voice commands.\n\n\"I think people were waiting with bated breath to see what Apple would do,\" says Mark Sivak, an associate teaching professor at Northeastern. \"Honestly, in some ways, it is surprising, but in some ways is not.\"\n\nThe announcement came in June at the developers conference, but it won't be available for preorder until the beginning of next year. Plus, the starting price is $3,500. Apple is giving itself a lot of room to make changes.\n\n\"It definitely brings the industry forward,\" says Sivak. \"Because this will be the first consumer device that is not, at least in marketing, is not meant as a gaming device.\"\n\nThe Vision Pro will serve as a more compact laptop because it's like a pair of ski goggles, allowing users to bring it with them. The main difference is that the Vision Pro doesn't have any controllers or a mouse and keyboard.\n\nPlus, Apple is ready to create a seamless ecosystem with a VR headset, allowing it to connect to other Apple products, which gives it a leg up in terms of content, says MacIntyre. A 3D game for a phone can easily translate to a VR headset.\n\n\"The big question is, can they find the one niche thing that will make it a must-have, right?\" asked MacIntyre. \"There is still no killer app for these devices.\"\n\nIn terms of regular everyday people switching to using these headsets, Sivak says, \"Not yet.\" But in five to 10 years, maybe.",

        "content": "Apple's AirPods Pro 2 have dropped to £189 at Laptops Direct, delivering a solid £40 off their £229 retail price.\n\nWhile not quite matching their £179 Prime Day deal from a couple of weeks ago, this is still a great chance for those who missed out – most retailers put them back up to their regular price post-Prime Day.\n\nBest Apple AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds deal\n\nThe AirPods Pro 2 represent Apple's triumphant entry into five-star territory after years of solid – but not quite exceptional – wireless earbuds.\n\nThese second-generation flagships finally deliver the complete package that places them alongside class-leading competitors from Sony and Bose.\n\nAt the heart of the Pro 2's success lies Apple's advanced H2 chip, which powers significant improvements across active noise-cancelling, sound quality, and battery performance.\n\nThe ANC capabilities have been dramatically enhanced, with Apple claiming twice the background noise reduction compared to the original Pro model.\n\nIn practice, this translates to impressively effective isolation that makes background chatter and transport noise fade to a comfortable murmur.\n\nThe earbuds themselves remain visually identical to their predecessors, but Apple has refined the experience with useful additions.\n\nTouch-capacitive volume controls finally grace the stems – a long-overdue feature that responds reliably to up and down swipes.\n\nThe inclusion of an extra-small ear tip size broadens the fit options, too, while the USB-C charging case gains a built-in speaker for location tracking.\n\nSound quality represents the most significant leap forward, though. They deliver a richer, more powerful presentation that maintains Apple's signature clarity, while adding welcome weight and dynamic authority.\n\nThese earbuds demonstrate impressive versatility across genres, even if rivals like the Sony WF-1000XM5 offer even greater insight and rhythmic ability.\n\n(Image credit: What Hi-Fi?)\n\nOverall, the performance feels more engaging and entertaining than previous AirPods generations as well, with improved rhythmic drive that keeps listeners hooked.\n\nVoices remain a particular strength – from gravelly vocals to podcast dialogue, they deliver natural, focused reproduction that draws you into whatever content you're consuming.\n\nSome iOS updates have also added valuable features, including Adaptive Audio, which intelligently adjusts noise-cancelling levels based on your surroundings. Conversation Awareness also smoothly reduces music volume when you start speaking.\n\nBattery life is six hours from the earbuds with ANC active, with a total of 30 hours including the charging case – competitive, but not class-leading.\n\nThe seamless integration with iOS devices remains unmatched, with near-instant pairing and intuitive operation that simply works without requiring too much thought.\n\nIn short, at this reduced price of £189 at Laptops Direct, the AirPods Pro 2 make a compelling case to take the plunge and experience five-star audio at a nicely discounted price.\n\nMORE:\n\nSony WF-1000XM5 vs Apple AirPods Pro 2: which premium earbuds are better?\n\nOur pick of the best wireless earbuds you can buy right now\n\nApple AirPods 4 vs AirPods Pro 2: what are the differences?",

        "content": "Personally, I cannot fathom running without some form of entertainment. And I get that finding the best headphones for running is crucial to getting through those miles, no matter if you’re a casual jogger or hardcore marathoner. But with a dizzying array of options out there—from earbuds to bone-conduction headphones to sporty sunglasses—it’s hard to pick which ones you want or need.\n\nThat’s why we did the hard work for you, testing a gazillion different ’buds to bring you only the cream of the crop. You can forget about constantly readjusting loose earbuds or battling tangled wires, because these selections were chosen to stay put and deliver crystal-clear sound mile after mile, so that when you get to the good part of your podcast, it’s not going to drop out. We’re talking about headphones that can handle sweat, rain, and the accidental drop, so you can focus on your stride, not your tech.\n\nOver the past decade, headphone technology has seen significant advancements, particularly in wireless connectivity and sound quality. Bluetooth technology has greatly improved, offering more stable connections and higher-quality audio. Noise cancellation has also become more sophisticated, with many headphones now featuring active noise cancellation that can adapt to different environments or are adjustable in the app. Bone conduction technology is also readily available now, giving runners a different listening experience that leaves the ears open. A perfect fit and pristine sound quality will make your runs more enjoyable—and feel faster.\n\nBest Headphones for Running\n\nBest Overall:\n\nBest Value:\n\nBest Sound:\n\nBest Open-Ear Headphones:\n\nBest for Triathlons:\n\nWhy Trust Us\n\nRunner’s World editors have been testing gear tirelessly for over 50 years. That means a lot of miles in a lot of shoes—mid-run music has become a godsend for plenty of us as we tap out our favorite loops day after day. In short, we review products with a focus on finding the best tech for avid runners.\n\nAll of the earbuds we recommend here are here because we’ve run with them, sweat all over them, toyed with their fit, and ultimately enjoyed them. We’re not just throwing AirPods on this list because everyone has them, for example—we eschewed the latest version in favor of the , which offer a more snug fit.\n\nNobody else contributes to our decision-making process, especially not the brands we’ve picked. Every round of recommendations goes through the same set of evaluations, ensuring that all of our new options still have the same level of quality that was present in our initial roundup.\n\nHow We Tested\n\nTo pinpoint the best running headphones, our team put each pair through thorough, real-world testing for weeks—and sometimes even months. (And not for anything, I’ve had a pair of the original Beats Pro for 5 years, and they’re still rocking.) We had all kinds of runners try them out, from marathoners to casual joggers, to make sure our results would work for everyone. This way, we got feedback on comfort, fit, and performance for every running style and distance.\n\nOur tests weren’t just in one spot; we put these headphones through all sorts of situations to see how tough and functional they really are. This meant runs in different weather, from sunshine to sudden downpours, and at various elevations, to check their performance under different physical stresses. We also tested them in places with different noise levels—from quiet trails where you don’t need to hear much around you, to busy city streets where safety and clear sound are super important.\n\nThrough this rigorous evaluation, we were able to pinpoint headphones that could withstand sweat, accidental drops, and general wear and tear associated with regular running. We paid close attention to factors like secure fit, battery life, sound quality, and the effectiveness of features like noise cancellation and ambient awareness in real-world scenarios.\n\nBecome a Runner’s World+ member for exclusive access to product testing opportunities!\n\nFull Reviews\n\nBest Overall Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 $180 at Amazon $179 at Walmart$180 at Target Credit: Dan Roe Pros\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\nKey Specs Battery (buds) 12 hours Battery (case) N/A Type Bone Conduction, Wireless Water Resistance IP55 Noise-Canceling No Transparency Mode No\n\nThe Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 headphones are a real game-changer for runners who want great sound without sacrificing safety or comfort. Aly Ellis, our Director of Content Hype, sums it up perfectly: “These are my favorite running headphones ever, specifically, the Kipchoge edition. They get loud enough that you can hear them while running, but you can hear noise and traffic around you. I listen to music, podcasts, and audiobooks while wearing mine, and they all sound great!”\n\nThat open-ear design is the magic here—it keeps you aware of your surroundings, whether you’re dodging bikes on a trail or crossing busy streets.\n\nTrevor Raab\n\nSound quality is where the OpenRun Pro 2 really shines, thanks to dual drivers that blend crisp highs from bone conduction with deep bass from air conduction tech that give a unique, immersive sound. You get 12 hours of battery life, so you can go for long runs (or even a marathon!) without worrying about charging. The fit is secure and stable, with ergonomic ear hooks and a memory wire frame that stays put no matter how much you sweat or move around.\n\nAnother standout is the dedicated EQ modes in the Shokz app, letting you tweak your audio for different environments—boost it when it’s noisy, or keep it classic for everyday runs. Calls are crystal clear, even in windy conditions, thanks to dual microphones and smart noise reduction. If you want headphones that sound great, stay comfortable, and keep you safe and aware, the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 is tough to beat.\n\nBest Value JLab Go Sport+ $30 at Amazon $30 at Walmart Credit: Dan Roe Pros\n\n\n\nCons\n\nKey Specs Battery (buds) 9 hours Battery (case) 26 hours Type Truly Wireless Earbuds with Ear Hooks Water Resistance IP55 Noise-Canceling No Transparency Mode Yes\n\nThe JLab Go Sport+ headphones are a fantastic option for runners and fitness fans who want reliable, sweatproof wireless earbuds without breaking the bank. These earbuds are all about getting the basics right: with an IP55 sweat and dirt resistance rating, they can handle even your sweatiest, muddiest workouts. The over-ear hooks and three sizes of silicone ear tips mean you get a secure, comfortable fit—no matter how much you move, these buds stay put without pinching or slipping.\n\nOne of the biggest highlights is battery life: You get 9-plus hours per earbud, plus another 26-plus from the charging case, for a whopping 35 hours total. That’s more than enough for a week of workouts, and the integrated USB cable makes recharging the case a breeze. Pairing is simple, especially if you’re on Android thanks to Google Fast Pair, and the connection is rock-solid up to 50 feet away.\n\nDan Roe\n\nThe sound quality could be better. It can sound a bit tinny and awkward when you’re expecting something bolder or more rounded. For under $30, though, they’re nothing to laugh at. And with the features and battery life, we think it’s a fair trade.\n\nThe JLab Go Sport+ also includes a \"Be Aware\" mode, which lets in ambient sound so you can stay alert on busy streets or trails. And with the JLab app, you can customize your sound profile and touch controls to suit your preferences. While the audio quality isn’t as rich or dynamic as that of some pricier competitors—think a bit hollow, especially if you’re an audiophile—it’s more than good enough for podcasts, playlists, and calls on the go.\n\nAll in all, if you’re after affordable, dependable, and comfortable wireless earbuds for running or the gym, the JLab Go Sport+ is a solid pick that punches above its price point.\n\nBest Sound Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 $249 at Amazon $249 at Walmart$250 at Target Credit: Stefan Vazharov Pros\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\nKey Specs Battery (buds) Up to 10 hours per bud with ANC off (8 hours with ANC on) Battery (case) Up to 35 additional hours with ANC off (28 hours with ANC on); total up to 45 hours Type True wireless, in-ear, with secure-fit earhooks Water Resistance IPX4 Noise-Canceling Yes Transparency Mode Yes\n\nThe Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds are designed to stay put, thanks to flexible earhooks and five ear tip sizes, so you can focus on your run instead of fiddling with your headphones. The IPX4 water resistance means they’ll handle sweat and rain without a hitch.\n\nThe sound quality is on point—expect punchy bass and crisp highs (as someone who has worn these, Hamilton has never sounded better), which blend into a nicely balanced sound that makes your playlists pop. Its active noise cancellation and transparency modes are handy, letting you block out the gym clatter and your children’s video game sounds when you want to focus, or let in the world when you’re running on the street and would rather not be taken out by a minivan.\n\nBattery life is another big win. You get up to 10 hours per bud (8 if you’re using ANC), and the charging case stretches your total playtime to an astonishing 45 hours. Forgot to charge? No worries—a quick five-minute boost gives you over an hour of listening time.\n\nThere are a few drawbacks: the price is on the higher side, and the new heart rate monitoring feature isn’t quite polished yet, especially for iPhone users. Plus, there’s no customizable EQ, which might disappoint anyone who likes to fine-tune their sound.\n\nOverall, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are a nice pick if you want secure, great-sounding earbuds that go the distance—just don’t expect them to replace your fitness tracker.\n\nBest Open-Ear Headphones OpenRock X Headphones $170 at Amazon Pros\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\nKey Specs Battery (buds) 6 hours Battery (case) 18 hours Type Truly wireless Water Resistance IPX4 Noise-Canceling No Transparency Mode Always-on\n\nThe OpenRock X headphones are simply impeccable. As someone who’s sweated through (and destroyed) more headphones than I care to admit, I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable and durable these open-ear sport earbuds are. Thanks to their clever adjustable fit, they stayed in through everything, from sprints to sweaty HIIT sessions. And I never felt that dreaded ear fatigue. Even better, the IPX5 water resistance means they shrugged off my sweatiest workouts without missing a beat.\n\nSound-wise, the OpenRock X delivers a surprisingly full listening experience for open-ear headphones, with everything from show tunes to the dulcet sounds of Richard Attenborough, especially in rock mode (maybe Attenborough doesn’t need rock mode, but I think he’d appreciate it all the same). The LISO 2.0 algorithm and BassDirect tech do a nice job of keeping things groovy.\n\nThat said, the volume control can be a little finicky—it sometimes felt tricky to land on the “just right” setting, which might be the trade-off for that open-ear design. Still, being able to hear traffic and stay situationally aware is a good safety point for runners who can zone out pretty hard.\n\nOne of my favorite features is the charging case. It’s slim, sturdy, and slides into the tiny pocket in my leggings with zero fuss—no more awkward sliding around or expensive lost cases at the gym. Add in 12 hours of playtime per charge (48 hours with the case) and fast charging, and you’ve got a pair of headphones that can keep up with even the most relentless training schedule. If you want comfort, awareness, and sweatproof reliability, the OpenRock X is a winner—just be ready to fiddle with the volume a bit.\n\nBest for Triathlons Suunto Aqua Now 22% Off $179 $139 at Amazon Pros\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\nKey Specs Battery (buds) Up to 10 hours Bluetooth playback, 6 hours offline playback Battery (case) Up to 20 additional hours; total up to 30 hours Type True wireless, open-ear, bone conduction with flexible band Water Resistance IP68 (waterproof to 5 meters for 2 hours) Noise-Canceling No Transparency Mode Always On\n\nThe Suunto Aqua headphones are a joy for athletes who want to take their music literally everywhere—even underwater. Designed with bone conduction tech and a flexible, banded open-ear fit, these headphones are the perfect pick for runners, cyclists, and especially swimmers. Features Editor Pavlína Černá raves, “They are great, I can continue listening to my audiobooks on the run while also being aware of what’s happening around me and feeling safe.”\n\nThe open-ear design means you’ll never lose track of traffic ordrown out training partners or poolside lifeguards, and at just 35 grams, you’ll forget you’re even wearing them.\n\n“They hold in place very well and are super light and waterproof so I don’t worry about wearing them in whatever weather Pennsylvania throws at us,” Ċerná says.\n\nThanks to IP68 waterproofing, you can swim up to 5 meters deep, and the band stays secure whether you’re running, riding, or doing laps. The 32GB onboard storage is a game-changer for swimmers—store hours of music or audiobooks and leave your phone behind.\n\nAudio quality is solid for bone conduction, with three sound modes (Normal, Outdoor, Underwater) to help you get the best from your tunes, though don’t expect the richness of in-ear buds. Controls are easy to use, even if the button layout takes a little getting used to. Battery life is a respectable 10 hours per charge, with 20 extra hours from the case.\n\nAs Černá sums up, “I do other sports outside of just running, so the fact that they are just as great for riding, for example, definitely adds to their value.”\n\nIf you want headphones that can keep up with every adventure—rain, shine, or swim—the Suunto Aqua is a smart, durable pick.\n\nBest Apple Earbuds Apple Airpods Pro 2 Now 32% Off $249 $169 at Amazon $169 at Walmart Credit: Thomas Hengge Pros\n\n\n\nCons Key Specs Battery (buds) 6 hours Battery (case) 24 hours Type Truly Wireless Earbuds Water Resistance IPX4 Noise-Canceling Yes Transparency Mode Yes\n\nApple’s AirPods Pro 2 are the gold standard for wireless earbuds, and also the most ubiquitous. They’re the overwhelming favorite earbuds on the market. I think that’s largely due to the fact that the moment you pop them in, you notice the comfortable, secure fit (thanks to four ear tip sizes) and Apple’s signature ergonomic design. Whether you’re commuting, running, or just trying to listen to your romance novel audiobook without scandalizing your family, these buds stay put and feel featherlight.\n\nThanks to a custom high-excursion driver and Apple's H2 chip, your hype music comes in sharp and booming, even in loud environments. Apple's active noise cancellation is superior among the best of the best, and adaptive transparency mode lets you hear what’s going on around you to the level you can stand when you’re trying to get your workout on. Adaptive audio and conversation awareness are new for this version which automatically blend ANC and transparency or they lower your volume when you start talking. Personally, I didn’t notice this sound degradation, but my husband says that to him, it’s noticeable.\n\nBattery life is pretty good—up to 6 hours per bud and 30 hours total with the little white case. The case itself is instantly recognizable, supports wireless and USB-C charging, and even has a speaker and Find My integration for those inevitable “where did I put them?” moments. (And not for anything, there’s about a million ways to customize these if you’re on Etsy.) They’re also IP54 rated, so they’ll handle sweat and a little rain, though they’re not meant for swimming laps like the Suunto Aqua.\n\nThey aren’t perfect, though. The case scratches easily, and you get the best experience only if you’re using Apple devices. Still, for iPhone users who want top-tier sound, seamless controls, and noise cancellation that actually works, the AirPods Pro 2 are going to be an obvious go-to for many runners.\n\nRead Full Review\n\nBest for Ultrarunners Cambridge Melomania M100 Now 17% Off $119 $99 at Amazon Pros\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\nKey Specs Battery (buds) Up to 16 hours per bud (10 hours with ANC on) Battery (case) Up to 36 additional hours (23 with ANC on); total up to 52 hours (33 with ANC on) Type True wireless, in-ear, with 5 pairs of ear tips (3 silicone, 2 memory foam) Water Resistance IPX4 (splash and sweat resistant) Noise-Canceling Adaptive Hybrid ANC Transparency Mode Yes\n\nFor ultrarunners, headphones need to be more than just good—they need to deliver a near-perfect combination of power and comfort, all while sipping power efficiently. The Cambridge Audio Melomania M100 delivers on that front, combining ultramarathon-worthy staying power, a secure and customizable fit, and hi-fi sound that’ll almost make you forget how badly you want to die.\n\nLet’s start with the mission-critical features: With up to 16 hours per charge (10 with ANC on) and a whopping 52 hours total with the case, these are the rare earbuds that can last through a full day, an overnight relay, or even a multi-stage ultra. A 10-minute top-up gives you another 1.5 hours of playtime, so you’re never stuck running in silence. Pee break or snacks? Power up.\n\nFit is another win for endurance athletes. The M100s come with five pairs of ear tips (three silicone, two memory foam),which make it easy to find that “barely there” feel that won’t bug you—as much—at mile 40. They’re light, IPX4 splash-resistant, and stay put even when you’re bounding down rocky, muddy trails or sweating through a summer long run.\n\nSound is where Cambridge Audio’s fancy speaker pedigree shows: there’s a metric ton of technical stuff happening in these tiny buds that serve to give a rich, detailed experience that made my ultra playlist filled with Steely Dan and My Chemical Romance soothe my brain. Like others on this list, it has adaptive hybrid ANC and a nice transparency mode for your listening pleasure.\n\nUnfortunately, the case is a bit chunky for some shorts pockets, so it will take space in your run belt, and some users report minor quirks with transparency and auto-pause. But for ultrarunners who demand comfort, stamina, and killer sound, the Melomania M100 will get your ears through what your legs may not survive.\n\nBest New Style Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer Smart Glasses $379 at Amazon $329 at Macy's Pros\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Specs Battery (buds) 4 hours Battery (case) 36 hours Type Smart glasses with open-ear audio, polarized sunglasses, and camera Water Resistance IPX4 Noise-Canceling No Transparency Mode Always-on (open-ear design) Camera 12MP photo / 1080p video Storage 500 photos or 100 60-second videos\n\nThe Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer smart glasses are a triple threat for anyone who wants more than just headphones: for a price similar to other premium earbuds on this list, you’re also getting classic polarized sunglasses and a built-in camera, all wrapped up in a retro-feeling Wayfarer (or Headliner) frame. If you’re the type who loves multitasking or capturing moments on the go, these glasses are just so much fun. (You should see how many random pics of my hubs and kids I have from these!)\n\nI found them surprisingly easy to wear for hours at a time. That said, the fit wasn’t perfect out of the box—I had to add felt pads to the nose bridge to keep them from sliding down, but that’s a quick fix and well worth it for the added stability. The open-ear speakers are discreet and let you enjoy music or podcasts without blocking out the world, which is perfect for walks, commutes, or just staying aware of your surroundings. I do wish they got a little louder, but any more volume would mean serious audio leakage, so it’s a reasonable trade-off for privacy.\n\nThe built-in 12MP camera is fun for capturing quick photos and videos, and the glasses connect seamlessly to your phone for sharing all those moments you grab on your run. (Don’t just tell everyone you’re a marathoner; show them with pics from every mile.) Battery life is decent—about 4 hours per charge, with a case that bumps total use up to 36 hours. If you want sunglasses, headphones, and a camera in one package, smart glasses like these are a neat new option. Just expect a few compromises compared to dedicated audio or camera gear, but for everyday convenience and style, they’re a standout.\n\nRelated Story The Best Cheap Wireless Earbuds for Runners\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nChoosing the right running headphones can really make your run.

Testers compared their running earbuds to other headphones they’ve tried and provided specific feedback on the depth and clarity of their favorite songs and podcasts.\n\nTypes of Headphones In-ear headphones, also known as earbuds, fit directly into the ear canal. They are often compact and lightweight, making them highly portable. In-ear headphones can offer good sound isolation, blocking out some external noise and, depending on the fit, a decent level of bass. They often come with various ear tip sizes to make sure they’re not going to fall out of your ears. Hook headphones typically feature a design with hooks that wrap around the ears for added stability. This makes them popular for activities like running or exercising, where a secure fit is crucial to prevent them from falling out. Hook headphones can come in various styles, including earbuds with hooks and over-ear, open-ear styles with hooks. Bone conduction headphones work by transmitting sound vibrations through the bones of your skull, bypassing the eardrums. This allows you to hear audio while still keeping your ears open to your surroundings. This is especially useful for runners who need to be aware of traffic or other environmental sounds. Open-ear headphones are designed to sit outside the ear, allowing you to hear both your audio and the environment around you. They don't block your ear canal, so you remain aware of your surroundings, which is helpful for safety during outdoor activities. However, they may leak sound, and the audio quality might not be as immersive as other types. Headphones with storage typically include onboard memory where you can store music files directly on the headphones. This eliminates the need to carry a separate device for music playback. This feature is particularly convenient for runners or swimmers who prefer not to bring their phones along. Glasses with integrated headphones, such as the Meta Ray-Bans, offer a nifty audio experience by combining eyewear with sound technology. These devices feature small speakers embedded in the frame, allowing users to listen to music, podcasts, or take calls, photos, and video without traditional earbuds. The sound is directed towards the ears, providing a personal listening experience while still permitting some awareness of the surrounding environment. Water and Sweat Resistance While our testers experienced no immediate issues with water or sweat damage, prolonged exposure to moisture and salt can harm earbuds not designed to repel these elements. That’s why we found it imperative that we checked out each device’s “IP,” or ”Ingress Protection” rating. This rating consists of two digits: The first digit indicates the level of dust protection. The second digit represents water or liquid ingress protection, which is especially important for runners.\n\nAn “X” in place of either digit signifies that no data is available for that specific protection level (e.g., “IPX” means dust protection was not evaluated).\n\nA second-digit score of 1 or 2 means the earbuds can resist dripping water.\n\nSecond-digit scores of 3 to 6 indicate the earbuds can withstand increasing amounts of rainfall for longer durations.\n\nA second-digit score of 7 to 9 is the highest standard, meaning the earbuds can be submerged in varying depths of water without failing. Noise Cancellation vs Ambient Awareness Picking between noise cancellation and ambient awareness for your running headphones is like choosing your own adventure. If you're dodging chatty pedestrians in the urban jungle, ambient awareness—whether that be found in typical earbuds or open-ear style headphones—might be your best bet, keeping you alert to honks and “behind you” shouts. But if you’re hitting the serene trails, craving that deep focus, or you have really noisy coworkers or hate the sound of grunting gym bros, let noise cancellation be your peaceful respite, blocking out everything but the sound of your own steady rhythm and, perhaps, a suspenseful podcast. Battery Life and Connectivity Battery life is essential for running headphones, especially for long distances. Will these headphones endure the entirety of your week’s run plan without dying? I’m terrible at remembering to charge my stuff, so this is crucial for folks like me. Connectivity is also important. Most running headphones use Bluetooth, and the range can vary. Ideally, you want a stable connection that won't drop out when your phone is a few steps away. Typical Bluetooth range is around 30 feet, but interference can reduce this. Some newer headphones offer improved Bluetooth versions for greater range and stability. Headphone Companion Apps Headphones, like other gadgets, have firmware that controls their functions and features. Manufacturers often release updates to improve performance, add new features, or fix issues with firmware, which can have bugs or limitations like any software. These updates are crucial for maintaining optimal functionality and ensuring compatibility with the latest devices and technologies. Many of today's best headphones and earbuds have companion apps that allow users to manage and update the firmware. Additionally, these updates may introduce new features (e.g., enhanced noise cancellation, improved call quality, and more customization options), all of which are managed through the partner app. Keeping the firmware up to date via the app ensures that the headphones perform optimally and offer the latest features. Durability When it comes to running headphones, durability is honestly everything, because, who wants to buy a new pair every few months? Trust us, our team put these headphones through the wringer, testing them for weeks, sometimes even months and years (yep, we’re that dedicated) to find the ones that can actually keep up with your miles. We sweated on them, dropped them, stuffed them in gym bags, and even braved a few surprise rain showers—just to make sure they’re as tough as your training routine. So, when we say these are the best running headphones for durability, you know we mean it.\n\nThomas Hengge\n\nQ+A\n\nwith Running Reviews Editor Amanda Furrer\n\nHow do you listen to music and run phone-free? As a loyal Garmin user, I recommend using models like the Forerunner 245 Music or the Forerunner 965, which I’m currently wearing. The latter has more features if you’re a multi-sport, stats-junkie, but the price is significantly higher. The watches allow you to sync with music providers, such as Spotify. Most earbuds, with the exception of Apple Airpods, are Garmin compatible. How do you pair wireless earbuds to your Garmin? Test Editor Morgan Petruny offers a helpful guide on pairing your earbuds to devices. Here are her instructions on pairing them to you Garmin: With your earbuds in pairing mode, press and hold the Up button on your Garmin (the middle of the three on the left). Scroll down to Music and select that option using the Start/Stop button. Next, scroll and select Earbuds and then Add New. Garmin will scan for nearby earbuds and you can select your earbuds once they appear on the list. How do you clean earbuds? For a deep clean, fill a glass with a drop of dish soap in half a cup of warm water. Remove the foam or silicone tips from the earbuds, and let them soak in the soap mixture for 30 minutes. Use a cotton swab or Q-Tip to remove excess particles. Allow the tips to air dry before screwing them back on. Use a clean old toothbrush to gently scrub the actual earbuds, mesh cover pointed down.",

        "content": "Vision Pro is getting some friends over the next couple of years.\n\nVision Pro is getting some friends over the next couple of years. Credit: UCG / Getty Images\n\nApple's Vision Pro headset seems to have taken a back seat lately, but a new report claims that Apple still has a very ambitious roadmap with seven head-mounted products in the pipeline.\n\nThis is according to Apple sleuth Ming-Chi Kuo, who detailed the company's plans in a blog post Sunday. Kuo claims that Apple views head-mounted devices as \"the next major trend in consumer electronics,\" and that it's currently working on three Vision series products and four smart glasses variants.\n\nVision Pro and Vision Air\n\nStarting with the Vision Pro, Apple is reportedly working on an upgraded version of the headset, scheduled to enter mass production in the third quarter of 2025. This is said to be a very simple upgrade, with the main processor upgraded from Apple's M2 to M5, and other specifications remaining the same.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2027, Apple plans to launch what Kuo calls \"Vision Air,\" a \"substantially lighter\" headset that will be powered by the latest flagship iPhone processor. The Vision Air will reportedly have fewer sensors, more plastic and less glass, and magnesium alloy instead of titanium alloy, which should reduce weight more than 40 percent compared to the Vision Pro, and allow Apple to sell it at a \"significantly lower price point\" than the $3,499 Vision Pro.\n\nFeatured Video For You Apple Vision Pro: I tried it on a plane and it was chaotic\n\nAnd yes, Apple is still planning to launch an upgraded Vision Pro, with a new design, lighter body, and a lower price point, but that's not coming before the second half of 2028.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

These reportedly won't have a display; just like the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, they'll have audio playback, voice control, a camera, and AI environmental sensing. Apple's version will also have a gesture recognition user interface, says Kuo.\n\nThen there are the \"XR Glasses,\" which are reported to have a LCoS (liquid crystal on silicon) display, voice control, and gesture recognition. For these, AI functionality will be \"critical to product success,\" Kuo says. The report also claims that there's an additional variant in development with a later production timeline.\n\nFinally, Kuo says that Apple has halted development of a \"display accessory\" that would be cable-tethered to the Max, but there's still a chance that it could be restarted.\n\nSlow and steady wins the race?\n\nOne immediate takeaway from all this is that Apple reportedly isn't launching any major new products in either of these categories for two more years (the slightly updated Vision Pro barely counts).\n\nThe good news is that, if Kuo's sources are accurate, Apple still plans to have a very wide and varied ecosystem of head-mounted devices in a few years' time. Competitors such as Meta, as well as Xiaomi — which just launched its own version of smart glasses — are already a few steps ahead, so Apple's gonna have to up its game.",

        "content": "Streamplay Studio (ASX: SP8) has experienced a return to positive operating cash flow following the acquisition and integration of Noodlecake Studios and the continued optimisation of its global footprint.\n\nThe company delivered a cash flow positive quarter, posting an operating surplus of approximately $390,000 while investing in new game launches for Noodlecake.\n\nReceipts from customers totalled $1.44 million and the company’s cash reserves remain strong at $7.72 million with no debt against a disciplined operating structure.\n\nCross-platform release\n\nThe quarter kicked off with Streamplay’s first-ever cross-platform release on Nintendo Switch and PC, followed by the global launch of high-profile mobile games Ultimate Chicken Horse and Super Flappy Golf plus a multi-year licensing agreement with Amazon.\n\nUltimate Chicken Horse surpassed 177,500 downloads in less than in two weeks across android and iOS and Super Flappy Golf, which follows a longer-term commercial model, reached over 83,500 downloads by end June.\n\nStreamplay continues to evaluate new third-party publishing opportunities, including several high-quality titles sourced from inbound submissions and from the Game Developers Conference 2025 held earlier this year in San Francisco.\n\nThe company is reviewing all titles for potential inclusion in Noodlecake’s future slate across mobile, PC and console platforms.\n\nPacific markets\n\nStreamplay continued its commercial engagement across the Pacific, with steady contributions from established markets and renewed focus on preparing the region for future service expansion.\n\nIn Papua New Guinea, the company reaffirmed its intent to scale operations and reinvest in the market which continues to generate solid revenues with minimal investment.\n\nBusiness in American Samoa and Tonga continued steadily, and preparations are underway for an expansion of value-added and SMS services including the introduction of caller ring back tones.\n\nStreamplay has advanced several initiatives to support long-term growth in the Pacific, including readiness for a new billing platform to drive business development and streamline future integrations across new markets and networks.\n\nRegional expansion\n\nStreamplay has made strong progress across cloud gaming initiatives in the Middle East, alongside early expansion into south Asia and the maintenance of service delivery in South Africa with limited investment.\n\nOngoing business development efforts throughout Middle East and Africa and south Asia are being supported by direct market engagement and regional partnership discussions, reinforcing Streamplay’s belief in the long-term commercial potential of its digital gaming ecosystems across diverse telco environments.\n\nThe company is also engaged in commercial discussions with new telcos and market partners to introduce additional products and services, complemented by a staged rollout of direct-to-consumer (B2C) offerings targeting non-telco audiences.\n\nMilestone quarter\n\nStreamplay chair Bert Mondello said the company had experienced a milestone quarter.\n\n“Returning to positive operating cash flow demonstrates that our acquisition and growth strategy is beginning to deliver operational leverage,” he said.\n\n“We have now established a scalable foundation and with Noodlecake’s pipeline building momentum and the regional deployment of key platforms underway, we remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable and capital-efficient growth.”",

        "content": "Legendary games, immersive interactive entertainment and publishing expertise accelerate growth in Microsoft’s Gaming business across mobile, PC, console and cloud.\n\nREDMOND, Wash. and Santa Monica, Calif. – Jan. 18, 2022 – With three billion people actively playing games today, and fueled by a new generation steeped in the joys of interactive entertainment, gaming is now the largest and fastest-growing form of entertainment. Today, Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard Inc. (Nasdaq: ATVI), a leader in game development and interactive entertainment content publisher. This acquisition will accelerate the growth in Microsoft’s gaming business across mobile, PC, console and cloud and will provide building blocks for the metaverse.\n\nMicrosoft will acquire Activision Blizzard for $95.00 per share, in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard’s net cash. When the transaction closes, Microsoft will become the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony. The planned acquisition includes iconic franchises from the Activision, Blizzard and King studios like “Warcraft,” “Diablo,” “Overwatch,” “Call of Duty” and “Candy Crush,” in addition to global eSports activities through Major League Gaming. The company has studios around the world with nearly 10,000 employees.\n\nBobby Kotick will continue to serve as CEO of Activision Blizzard, and he and his team will maintain their focus on driving efforts to further strengthen the company’s culture and accelerate business growth. Once the deal closes, the Activision Blizzard business will report to Phil Spencer, CEO, Microsoft Gaming.\n\n“Gaming is the most dynamic and exciting category in entertainment across all platforms today and will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO, Microsoft. “We’re investing deeply in world-class content, community and the cloud to usher in a new era of gaming that puts players and creators first and makes gaming safe, inclusive and accessible to all.”\n\n“Players everywhere love Activision Blizzard games, and we believe the creative teams have their best work in front of them,” said Phil Spencer, CEO, Microsoft Gaming. “Together we will build a future where people can play the games they want, virtually anywhere they want.”\n\n“For more than 30 years our incredibly talented teams have created some of the most successful games,” said Bobby Kotick, CEO, Activision Blizzard. “The combination of Activision Blizzard’s world-class talent and extraordinary franchises with Microsoft’s technology, distribution, access to talent, ambitious vision and shared commitment to gaming and inclusion will help ensure our continued success in an increasingly competitive industry.”\n\nMobile is the largest segment in gaming, with nearly 95% of all players globally enjoying games on mobile.

        "content": "SharpLink Gaming, a Nasdaq-listed gaming company, has made a bold move in the cryptocurrency market by becoming the largest corporate holder of Ethereum (ETH), surpassing the Ethereum Foundation. Between July 7 and July 13, the company acquired 74,656 ETH for approximately $213 million, at an average price of $2,852 per ETH. This purchase brought SharpLink's total ETH holdings to 280,706, valued at around $881 million, according to data from Arkham.\n\nSharpLink's acquisition spree continued, with the company purchasing an additional 6,377 ETH, bringing its seven-day buying spree to a total of 91,330 ETH obtained for about $275 million. The company has since staked almost all of its cryptocurrency, yielding more than 415 ETH, which translates to $1.3 million in rewards since early June. This strategy has resulted in a 23% increase in the company's \"ETH Concentration\" metric, indicating a rapidly growing ETH exposure per share.\n\nTo fund these acquisitions, SharpLink raised $413 million in fresh capital through its at-the-market (ATM) equity program between July 7 and July 11. The company has already used $156 million from this capital, with another $257 million earmarked for additional ETH purchases. This significant investment underscores SharpLink's commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem and its belief in the potential of ETH as a valuable asset.\n\nThe impact of SharpLink's monumental accumulation of ETH has been evident in the market. The company's share value has surged, with its stock price increasing by 21.31% during regular trading hours and an additional 11.32% in after-hours trading. Meanwhile, ETH has seen a respectable 5.8% gain in the last 24 hours and a 20.7% climb over the past week, outpacing Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Ethereum's improvement is also evident over longer time frames, with a 28.8% jump in two weeks and a 22.0% increase over the past month.\n\nSharpLink's dominance in the ETH market has significant implications. As the largest corporate holder, the company's actions and decisions can influence market sentiment and the overall trajectory of ETH. The substantial investment in ETH by SharpLink also underscores the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum. This trend is likely to continue as more corporations recognize the potential of digital assets and seek to integrate them into their investment portfolios.\n\nSharpLink's strategy of staking a significant portion of its ETH holdings is also noteworthy. Staking not only provides a means of earning passive income but also supports the security and stability of the Ethereum network. By staking 99.7% of its holdings, SharpLink is actively contributing to the network's health while also benefiting from the rewards associated with staking. This dual benefit makes staking an attractive option for large-scale ETH holders and highlights the potential for other corporations to follow suit.",

The game has been a top 10 mobile game every year since its original release in 2016, with more than 100 million users in 2024.\n\nBack in March, Scopely said it planned to continue pursuing the ambitious roadmaps for each of Niantic's games.\n\nNiantic, meanwhile, said that once the acquisition was completed, it will spin off into a new company, Niantic Spatial, focused on geospatial AI. It still owns the AR games Ingress Prime and Peridot.",

With CasinoSoft’s software suite, focused on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Title 31 compliance, automated tax forms, and jackpot reporting, the combined platform is designed to modernize casino floor, cage, and slot operations for both land-based and digital operators.\n\n“CasinoSoft is the industry standard for AML/Title 31 compliance, automated tax forms, jackpot processing, and associated reporting services,” said Diallo Gordon, President of Pavilion Payments.\n\n“With this acquisition, we plan to grow the broader Pavilion business with several new patents, innovative products, and transformative solutions that position us as the clear leader in fintech payments, cashless gaming, cage, and floor automation.”\n\nFounded over two decades ago, CasinoSoft's products enable casinos to remain audit-ready while reducing manual workloads and helping staff focus on guest services. The company’s client base includes a varied range of operators across the gaming industry.\n\n“We have put 20 years of our heart and soul into building the CasinoSoft brand and are thrilled with the many ways this acquisition moves us to the next level,” said Matt Montano, Principal and Owner of CasinoSoft. “The success of our robust suite of AML/Title 31 and tax form products is evidenced by the longstanding partnerships we enjoy with our many satisfied customers throughout the industry.”\n\nThe acquisition will allow Pavilion Payments to fold CasinoSoft’s offerings into its own product suite, effectively creating a single system for handling everything from payments and funding to regulatory compliance and reporting.\n\nThis vertical integration is expected to increase automation, reduce errors, and improve speed and security for gaming operators across all channels, including iGaming and sportsbooks.\n\nDan Connors, CEO of Pavilion Payments, said: “We pride ourselves on offering our partners and customers a vibrant and diverse portfolio of products and services. The addition of CasinoSoft’s products to our lineup furthers our delivery on that goal. We’re delighted to add CasinoSoft to our team.\"",

The purchase, which was made entirely with cash, will cement Microsoft as the third-largest gaming company in the world. The deal is targeting 2023 for a closing date.\n\n4 Reviews ← exclude selected types\n\nMicrosoft is now the third-largest gaming company in the world, thanks to its purchase of gaming juggernaut Activision Blizzard.\n\nThe purchase, announced today, is the largest acquisition in the history of the gaming industry. Microsoft purchased Activision Blizzard for US$68.7 billion in cash.\n\nMicrosoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard follows the purchase of two other large gaming companies, namely Zenimax Media (the parent company of Bethesda) in 2020 for $7.5 billion and Mojang (the studio behind Minecraft) in 2014 for $2.5 billion.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Microsoft said the purchase of Activision Blizzard will flesh out its Xbox Game Pass subscription service and position the tech giant to compete in the “metaverse,” a label for the burgeoning connected virtual reality environment many other tech companies are pushing toward.\n\nThe deal must now face examination by regulators in the United States and European Union, but Microsoft believes the deal will be finalized sometime in 2023.\n\nWhile Activision Blizzard’s corporate structure will change under its new owner, CEO Bobby Kotick will retain his role. Kotick came under fire last year after accusations of a toxic work culture surfaced, painting Activision Blizzard as a “breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women,” according to the Associated Press. Microsoft has stated that it will work to reshape Activision Blizzard’s work culture.\n\nActivision Blizzard is the company behind many popular games and franchises, including Call of Duty, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft (and the broader Warcraft franchise), Overwatch, and more. Microsoft will now own the rights to these franchises once the acquisition is finalized.\n\nBuy an Xbox Series S from Amazon.",

The company will be structured into three business units — Gaming, Digital, and FinTech — and will employ around 2,000 people in Nevada.\n\n“This is a defining moment for our industry,” said Nick Khin, interim CEO of IGT. “By uniting two leading organizations, we are building an enterprise with the scale, talent, and technology to lead the future of gaming. With Apollo’s support, we are very well-positioned to deliver exceptional content across land-based and digital experiences, along with integrated financial solutions and casino management that enhance the player journey and drive value for our customers.”\n\nDaniel Cohen, Partner at Apollo, said: “Bringing together highly complementary businesses creates a more competitive, agile, and well-capitalized platform built for long-term growth. We are confident that IGT is well-positioned to deliver differentiated content and capabilities that better serve customers across the globe. We look forward to working closely with Hector, Nick, and the rest of the talented IGT team to lead the industry forward.”\n\nThe acquisition, announced earlier this year, required clearance from 36 regulatory agencies, including final approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission last week.\n\nEveri stockholders are receiving $14.25 per share in cash, and IGT PLC is receiving $4.05 billion in gross cash proceeds. Everi’s common stock has been delisted from the New York Stock Exchange as part of the transaction.\n\nThe combined IGT entity brings together complementary capabilities in gaming, digital content, and financial technology solutions. Khin, a longtime Nevada gaming executive, will continue to serve as interim CEO until Hector Fernandez, former CEO of Aristocrat Gaming, assumes the role in the fourth quarter of 2025 following the expiration of his non-compete agreement.\n\nThe lottery operations previously owned by IGT PLC will now operate independently under the Brightstar Lottery brand, with the IGT name remaining with the newly headquartered Las Vegas company.",

        "content": "In this article ATVI\n\nMSFT Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nSatya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. Charles Pertwee | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nwatch now\n\nMicrosoft still has to win approval from Activision's shareholders and, more importantly, from regulators. Two recent mega-deals in the semiconductor industry — Nvidia's effort to buy Arm and AMD's agreement to purchase Xilinx — have both been held up in regulatory review for over a year. For Microsoft, the purchase price is more than double what the 47-year-old company has ever paid. Its top previous acquisition was LinkedIn in 2016, which cost over $26 billion. But Nadella, who succeeded Ballmer as Microsoft CEO in 2014, has the capital to spend and an investor base that's urging him to be aggressive.\n\nProportionally small\n\nAt the time of the LinkedIn announcement, Microsoft was valued at about $400 billion, so the purchase amounted to roughly 6.5% of its market cap. When it tried to buy Yahoo, Microsoft's market cap was around $260 billion, meaning it would've been giving up almost 20% of the company. Today, Microsoft has a valuation of almost $2.3 trillion and is paying just 3% of its market cap for Activision. Rather than using its increased stock value, Microsoft is paying Activision investors in cash. It's a hefty load, but Microsoft can afford it. As of Sept. 30, the company was sitting on $130 billion in cash and equivalents, with 85% of that in the form of short-term investments. Microsoft's purchase price is a 45% premium over Activision's closing price on Friday. But Microsoft investors seem fine with it. The stock fell just 2.4% on Tuesday — in line with many other tech stocks in an overall down day for the market. That's partly due to Nadella's proven success in integrating previous acquisitions, including LinkedIn and GitHub, which Microsoft bought for $7.5 billion in 2018. But it's more a reflection of the excitement around gaming and Microsoft's potential to expand its presence beyond the Xbox and its existing subscription service called Game Pass.\n\nwatch now",

        "content": "The all-cash transaction, announced last year , unites IGT’s legacy gaming assets and Everi’s digital and financial technology operations under one roof.\n\nThe newly combined enterprise will be privately held and headquartered in Las Vegas, operating under the IGT name, while selectively retaining the Everi brand across certain markets and product lines.\n\n“This is a defining moment for our industry,” said IGT interim CEO Nick Khin (pictured). “By uniting two leading organisations, we are building an enterprise with the scale, talent and technology to lead the future of gaming.”\n\nThe new IGT will be structured into three business segments: Gaming, Digital, and FinTech, promising a more integrated, customer-centric approach across the global gaming landscape.\n\nNew CEO to take over in Q4\n\nKhin, formerly COO of IGT, will lead the organisation in the interim and transition into the role of CEO of the Gaming division later this year.\n\nHector Fernandez, former Everi CEO, is slated to take the helm as CEO of IGT in Q4 2025, following the expiration of a non-compete agreement.\n\nFernandez is expected to bring his experience in digital expansion and financial systems integration to steer the new entity through its next phase of growth.\n\nApollo partner Daniel Cohen said the combination creates a “more competitive, agile and well-capitalised platform built for long-term growth.”\n\n“We are confident that IGT is well positioned to deliver differentiated content and capabilities that better serve customers across the globe,” he added.\n\nBrightstar’s plans\n\nAs part of the deal, Everi shareholders are receiving $14.25 per share in cash. Everi’s stock has now been delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nMeanwhile, the sale marks a new chapter for IGT’s former parent company.\n\nIn June, the former IGT lottery business rebranded to Brightstar and will now trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BRSL.\n\nBrightstar is receiving $4.05bn in gross cash proceeds from the deal and has laid out a detailed capital allocation plan.\n\nAccording to the company, approximately $2bn will go toward debt reduction, while $1.1bn will be returned to shareholders.\n\nA further $500m will be used to help fund payments related to the Italian lottery licence, while the remaining $400m is earmarked for general corporate purposes.\n\n“The sale of the Gaming & Digital business positions Brightstar for an exciting future,” said Brightstar executive chair Marco Sala.\n\n“The balanced allocation of proceeds to significantly reduce debt and return substantial capital to shareholders reflects the Board’s continuing commitment to enhance shareholder value.”\n\nBrightstar CEO Vince Sadusky added: “Today marks an exciting new chapter for the company, one that builds on a long legacy of delivering responsible, sustainable solutions through our products, services, technology, and insights.”\n\nBrightstar expects to maintain a strong balance sheet with a target net debt leverage ratio of around 3.0x, supported by robust cash flow.",

        "content": "New York CNN Business —\n\nMicrosoft on Tuesday announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard in a blockbuster deal worth nearly $70 billion. It’s one of the biggest acquisitions in the tech industry in recent years, one that will boost Microsoft’s standing in the growing gaming industry but could be complicated by recent concerns about Activision’s toxic culture.\n\nThe all-cash transaction is valued at $68.7 billion, and Microsoft says it will make the company the third-largest gaming company by revenue, after Tencent and Sony.\n\nBobby Kotick, the controversial CEO of Activision Blizzard, will continue in his role, according to a press release detailing the announced acquisition. Activision employees had previously staged walkouts and called on Kotick to step down for having allegedly been aware of widespread harassment and discrimination problems at the company for years.\n\nCalifornia’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a lawsuit against Activision Blizzard in August 2021 alleging a “frat boy” work culture that subjected female employees to discrimination, sexual harassment and unequal pay. It further alleged that “the company’s executives and human resources personnel knew of the harassment and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the unlawful conduct, and instead retaliated against women who complained.”\n\nJ. Allen Brack, Activision’s then-President, left his post following the allegations, and Activision hired an outside firm to investigate, taking cues from other corporate scandal-ridden companies like Uber.\n\nActivision Blizzard also agreed to an $18 million settlement in September in response to a separate lawsuit from the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. That suit had accused the company of subjecting female employees to sexual harassment and retaliating against them for complaining about harassment, and alleged it had “discriminated against employees due to their pregnancy.”\n\nThe news follows several months of reporting about allegations of inappropriate workplace behavior by Microsoft founder and former CEO Bill Gates in the company’s earlier years. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said last year that the company’s culture had evolved since then, and emphasized its focus on diversity and inclusion.\n\n“We believe that creative success and autonomy go hand-in-hand with treating every person with dignity and respect. We hold all teams, and all leaders, to this commitment,” said Phil Spencer, Microsoft Gaming CEO, in an official statement Tuesday. “We’re looking forward to extending our culture of proactive inclusion to the great teams across Activision Blizzard.”\n\nThe agreement is pending regulatory review and Activision Blizzard shareholder approval, with the deal set to close in 2023. The companies will continue to operate independently until the transaction is finalized, after which Activision Blizzard will report to Spencer. Activision Blizzard’s stock shot up more than 30% ahead of the market open Tuesday morning; Microsoft shares fell around 1.5%.\n\nGaming has become a major point of focus for Microsoft in recent years, especially as the pandemic meant more people were staying home and using gaming systems. In January 2021, on the heels of huge demand for its Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, Microsoft’s gaming revenue surpassed $5 billion for the first time.\n\nThe acquisition would boost Microsoft’s gaming business with the addition of Activision Blizzard games and the nearly 400 million monthly active players that come with them. Microsoft will also acquire Activision’s global game studios and its nearly 10,000 employees, according to the company.\n\nMicrosoft’s plans for cloud gaming will be accelerated by the deal, with the company hoping to push the Xbox community onto phone, tablets, laptops and other devices globally. And popular titles from Activision such as “Candy Crush” will improve Microsoft’s position in mobile gaming, too.\n\n“Acquiring Activision will help jump start MSFT’s broader gaming endeavors and ultimately its move into the metaverse with gaming the first monetization piece of the metaverse in our opinion,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe metaverse has been hailed as the next big thing for the tech industry — although there’s still a long way to go until such a virtual world is a reality, video games are likely to play a central role.\n\n“Gaming is the most dynamic and exciting category in entertainment across all platforms today and will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms,” said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a statement.\n\nThe deal could face significant scrutiny both in the United States and abroad from lawmakers and regulators, who have recently been focused on antitrust concerns in the Big Tech industry. While Microsoft has gotten less attention in that respect than fellow tech giants Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google, the deal could put Microsoft back in the spotlight, as it would make the company an even bigger player in the gaming industry. Microsoft acquired popular game developer Bethesda Softworks’ parent company, ZeniMax, in September 2020, in a $7.5 billion deal that also boosted its Xbox Game Pass portfolio.",

        "content": "SharpLink Gaming, Inc., a prominent entity in the cryptocurrency market, has recently expanded its Ethereum (ETH) holdings by acquiring an additional 4,904 ETH, resulting in a floating profit of $260 million. This strategic move is part of the company's ongoing efforts to bolster its ETH holdings and reflects a growing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe significance of SharpLink's acquisition lies in its scale, which underscores the institutional appeal of ETH. Market observers have noted a boost in confidence and potential shifts in liquidity as a result of this purchase. The acquisition was made just two hours ago, marking another step in SharpLink's aggressive strategy to accumulate ETH. Joseph Lubin, the chairman of SharpLink and a key figure in the creation of Ethereum, commented on the acquisition, stating, \"At a time when Ethereum is entering a new era of institutional relevance, we are proud to support the network’s long-term strength and decentralization mission.\"\n\nSharpLink Gaming is now recognized as the largest corporate holder of ETH, having shifted its focus from the gaming sector to cryptocurrency acquisition. This strategic pivot highlights the company's confidence in the long-term value potential of ETH. The immediate effects of this acquisition include increased bullish sentiment in the Ethereum market, which could impact related decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. SharpLink's strategy may also tighten the supply of liquid ETH, similar to the effects seen in MicroStrategy's Bitcoin acquisition strategy.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, SharpLink's continued capital influx is notable, as the company utilizes its recently raised $413 million. With the approval of a $5 billion stock issuance authority by the SEC, there is potential for further acquisitions. Analysts are closely monitoring SharpLink's moves, anticipating a rise in institutional Ethereum adoption. The acquisition of 4,904 ETH by SharpLink has boosted institutional confidence in Ethereum, with Joseph Lubin's support adding credibility. Ethereum's evolving infrastructure remains attractive for corporate treasuries, potentially influencing regulatory and market norms.",

The stock further fell after the bell and ended the after-hours trading session with a cut of 4.95% at $34.60, according to Google Finance.\n\nSBET is up 350% year-to-date; however, the stock is down 54% from its May 29 high of $79.21.\n\nIn the March quarter, SharpLink saw its revenue decline 24% year-on-year, while its net profit margin decreased by 110% during the quarter.\n\nThe company is expected to announce its next quarterly results on Aug. 13, according to Nasdaq.",

        "content": "Almost half of all creator ads on Meta don’t adhere to social media advertising best practices, according to a new report from CreativeX.\n\nThe report analyzed 1.6 million ads, equivalent to $2 billion worth of ad spend, to look at the performance of creator ads. CreativeX looked at a mix of creators’ and brands’ ads across Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The report defines creator ads as content made and posted to creators’ accounts.\n\nCreativeX’s technology vets creative content, and the company’s clients include Unilever and Nestlé. In the past 12 to 18 months, the company saw an influx of creator content in its system. Previously, most of the content the company analyzed was made and posted to brands’ own social media accounts, CreativeX’s founder and CEO Anastasia Leng told ADWEEK.\n\n“We became really interested in how brands were treating creator content differently from how they were treating their own branded content and how those decisions impacted creator content effectiveness,” she said.\n\nThe report suggests that creators are not using long-established best practices for social media like length and sound. Leng said the report shows a “false paradox between authenticity and suitability or effectiveness.” Up until now, marketers assumed that creators’ ads don’t need to adhere to best practices because creators’ ads are more seen as more authentic than brands’ ads.\n\n“Creators excel at humanising content and driving engagement, but there’s a clear opportunity to improve brand visibility and elevate brand messages,” Afke van de Klashort, vp of digital, media and ecommerce at Unilever Foods, in a statement.\n\nFor example, Meta has advised advertisers to mention a brand within the first three seconds of an ad since at least 2018, said Leng. Some marketers assumed that because users watch creators’ content for longer periods of time that these rules didn’t apply to creator ads. CreativeX’s report found that 14% of users watch creator ads past the first three seconds, dispelling the assumption that creator ads abide by different rules.\n\nAdditionally, 51% of creator ads on Meta and TikTok are branded in the first three seconds, leaving 49% of creators’ Meta and TikTok ads unbranded within the first three seconds. CreativeX’s report found that 45% of creator ads didn’t mention the brand within the first three seconds and also weren’t watched past the first three seconds.\n\nThe creator ads that were branded in the first three seconds had a 16% higher video completion rate, according to CreativeX’s analysis.\n\nCreator ads fall short across best practices\n\nThe report also analyzed the total length of creators’ ads.\n\nAcross Meta and TikTok, only 45% of creator ads were between 15 and 60 seconds long, which are considered best practices for the platforms. Creator ads that stayed within the length recommendations saw a 10% increase in video completion rate.\n\nCreators also aren’t using the “safe zones” within social apps properly, according to CreativeX’s findings. Safe zones are areas in the middle of the screen that are not cut off by a platform’s features including likes, comments, and call to actions. Meta and TikTok recommend that advertisers place the most important information within the safe zone, but few brands and creators actually do, according to CreativeX. Only 3% of creator ads use safe zones compared with 12% of brand ads. Placing information in a safe zone can lead to a 19% higher video completion rate.\n\n“There are real constraints that are algorithmically determined for these platforms,” said Leng. “This is not about changing the creator’s idea or their message, it’s about putting in a container where the user can actually fully enjoy that message in a way that plays by the rules of that platform.”",

        "content": "U.S. tech giants Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter and Microsoft Corporation's MSFT LinkedIn are reportedly fighting back against a tax case in Italy that could reshape how digital services are taxed across the European Union.\n\nWhat Happened: Meta, X and LinkedIn have filed an appeal against a landmark value-added taxes demand issued by Italian authorities, reported Reuters on Monday, citing four sources with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nItalian authorities argue that free access to social media platforms in exchange for users’ personal data constitutes a taxable transaction under VAT laws. This marks the first time Italy has moved beyond settlement talks with tech companies and into formal litigation.\n\nItaly is seeking €887.6 million ($1.03 billion) from Meta, €12.5 million from X and about €140 million from LinkedIn.\n\nSee Also: Meta Commits ‘Hundreds Of Billions’ To Build Massive AI Clusters In Race For Superintelligence\n\nMeta pushed back, telling the publication it has \"cooperated fully with the authorities\" but \"strongly disagrees with the idea that providing access to online platforms to users should be subject to VAT.\" LinkedIn said it had \"nothing to share at this time.\"\n\nWhy It's Important: The case could impact a wide range of businesses beyond social media—from airlines to supermarkets—that offer free services in exchange for data or cookie consent, the report said.\n\nItaly plans to seek advisory guidance from the European Commission's VAT Committee in November, with a formal opinion expected by spring 2026.\n\nIf Italy's interpretation is upheld, the legal precedent could transform how digital services are taxed throughout the 27-nation EU.\n\nThe case has gained added significance amid broader trade tensions between the EU and the U.S. under President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nAccording to Benzinga’s Edge Stock Rankings, META demonstrates consistent upward momentum over short, medium and long-term periods. While the company’s growth indicators are strong, its value rating is relatively lower. Additional performance details can be found here.\n\nLoading...

        "content": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nSocial media companies Meta, X and LinkedIn have appealed a VAT claim by Italy that could have wide-ranging effects on the way EU countries collect VAT on online activities, Reuters reported.\n\nItaly has made tax claims against tech companies in the past, but this is the first time the country has failed to reach a settlement, resulting in the initiation of a judicial tax trial, the news agency said, citing unnamed sources.\n\nThe situation came about because rather than merely seeking a settlement figure, Italy is also reportedly seeking to establish changes to VAT rules for social networks.\n\nPersonal data\n\nItalian tax authorities are reportedly arguing that free registrations on the social media platforms should be seen as taxable transactions, as they imply the provision of an account in exchange for access to a user’s personal data.\n\nTax officials are reportedly claiming 887.6 million euros (£769.3m) from Facebook parent Meta, 12.5m euros from X, formerly Twitter, and 140m euros from Microsoft-owned LinkedIn.\n\nThe three companies filed their appeals with a first instance tax court after a mid-July deadline for responding to a tax assessment notice, which was issued by Italy’s Revenue Agency in March, according to the report.\n\nItaly’s interpretation of VAT rules could apply to a wide range of companies that allow users to sign up for an account in exchange for agreeing to cookies, the report said.\n\nMeta said in a statement that it “strongly disagrees” with Italy’s assertion that providing access to online platforms should be subject to VAT.\n\nThe report said it is unclear whether a full trial, which involves three levels of judgement and takes an average of 10 years, would go ahead.\n\nItaly is reportedly seeking an advisory opinion from the European Commission’s VAT Committee, which meets twice a year.\n\nThe country’s Economy Ministry is reportedly seeking to submit questions in time for a November meeting of the committee to receive comments in time for the following meeting in spring 2026.\n\nVAT rules\n\nA negative assessment could prompt Italy to halt the case and ultimately drop investigators’ criminal case, the report said.\n\nThe White House has been pressuring the EU to drop regulatory constraints on US tech companies, as it makes trade policy threats involving tariffs and other measures.\n\nMeanwhile Meta is reportedly not planning to make further changes to the pay-or-consent model it offers in the EU to comply with competition rules, which could trigger daily fines.\n\nThe Financial Times reported last week that the European Commission has paused an investigation into whether X breached digital transparency rules, as it continues trade talks with the US.",

        "content": "AI continues to invade social apps this week as X updates its DMs, Meta incorporates the tech into its risk assessment and LinkedIn adds new analytics tools. Here’s the latest about what you need to know in social media.\n\nX\n\nElon Musk recently announced the launch of XChat, the social app’s updated direct messaging system, which is being beta tested now.\n\nOn June 1, Musk said on X: “All new XChat is rolling out with encryption, vanishing messages and the ability to send any kind of file. Also, audio/video calling. This is built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption, whole new architecture.”\n\nSome questions remain about the new tool’s security features, however.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch: “Ahead of this launch, X said it was pausing work on encrypted DMs, presumably because XChat would soon replace the older system.\n\n“In order to set up your new chat profile, you’ll need to create a four-digit code, adding another safety barrier,” according to\n\n“The added security points to DMs become the focus of X’s coming in-stream payments push, providing more assurance for users who may be looking to share money in the app.”\n\nX additionally launched XOriginals, a new platform for original content series where users can watch and engage with top content producers across sports, business and pop culture, like Khloe Kardashian.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta will begin incorporating AI to assess product risk, according to NPR.\n\n“In practice, this means things like critical updates to Meta’s algorithms, new safety features and changes to how content is allowed to be shared across the company’s platforms will be mostly approved by a system powered by artificial intelligence — no longer subject to scrutiny by staffers tasked with debating how a platform change could have unforeseen repercussions or be misused,” according to the outlet.\n\nThe change will allow product developers to release “app updates and features more quickly,” according to the news outlet.\n\nBut some have criticized the ethical dilemma of allowing AI to make risk decisions, which can be somewhat murky.\n\nIn a statement, Meta stood behind its decision by saying that it invests millions of dollars into user privacy.\n\n“Today, there are hundreds of data protection laws around the world. Our ability to compete and innovate hinges on how fast we adapt to the everchanging mosaic of legal requirements. That’s why we continue to work closely with regulators, policymakers and other experts to make sure our practices uphold the highest standards of data protection globally.”\n\nMeta additionally added updates to its Marketing API, Graph and Ad Copies API, including content monetization to help streamline ads.\n\nFrom the company: “We’re introducing a new insights metric, content_monetization_earnings,for Creators onboarded to Content Monetization. This new metric displays their earnings at a page or post level over a customizable time period. For page-level earnings, an additional breakdown is available for the content types that contributed to the overall earnings.”\n\nLinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn has added new analytics so users can see how their posts are driving engagement and interactions.\n\n“We often hear our members ask for more insight into how professionals are engaging with their content beyond likes or views,” LinkedIn said in a statement. “Starting today, we’re rolling out new post analytics to help you efficiently connect your content to meaningful outcomes. You’ll now see when a post drives profile viewers and new followers (available to all members), and clicks to your Premium custom button (like your website or newsletter) if you’re a subscriber. These signals reflect how your content is sparking interest, growing your presence, and motivating your audience to take action.”\n\nYouTube\n\nYouTube is beta-testing a live video engagement leaderboard.\n\nYouTube announced that “viewers earn points for engaging with streams and will see a crown icon at the top of the chat with the points they’ve earned from engaging on the creator’s live streams.\n\n“When they click on the crown icon, they’ll be taken to the leaderboard to see the top 50 most engaged viewers on that channel. The top three viewers on the leaderboard will earn a badge, which appears next to their name on live streams.”\n\nViewers can opt out of being shown publicly through their dashboard settings.\n\nThe app has also revamped how ads appear, making them less disruptive to livestreams and regular videos.\n\n“The ad will run alongside the livestream within the video player,” YouTube explained in a video. “The audio of the stream will be muted while the audio from the ad plays, then the video player will expand back, and the audio of the stream will be restored when the ad break has ended or the ad has been skipped.”\n\nThe video also explained an expansion of Google Lens for Shorts. Essentially, users can pinpoint a fixture in the Short, pause the video, click on the object of interest and learn more about it.\n\nFor example, the video mentions that if a user were to see a content creator in a really interesting place, the user could pause the video, click on a fixture in the background and learn more about that region or destination spot.\n\nInstagram\n\nInstagram has reformatted images to be compatible with 3:4 ratios. This small change means that images posted to the app will no longer be distorted and instead reflect a more accurate, original image.\n\nThe app developers also noted that 1:1 and 4:5 ratios will still be available. But the improvement could still be beneficial to content creators whose main focus is visuals.\n\nThe app creators also announced additional comment filtering for users with over 100,000 followers. Users can sort comments by newest comments, top comments and follower count. This helps users see interactions in a more clear, organized manner.\n\nWhatsApp\n\nWhatsApp has added more features to Status, or its messaging version of stories.\n\nWhatsApp is “adding new music sharing options, including the ability to turn a song into a music sticker, and add it to a separate status post: like a selfie, for extra pizzazz,” according to Social Media Today.\n\nThe update also includes new layouts with its option to make a collage, or add up to six images into one photo.\n\nBluesky\n\nBluesky has updated its profile verification to include “all notable users.”\n\nPer Social Media Today: “After launching its own form of in-app verification checkmarks last month, Bluesky is now expanding the roll-out of its verification ticks to more users, which will enable trusted, authoritative sources ensure gain more recognition in the app.”\n\nCourtney Blackann is a communications reporter.

        "content": "In this photo illustration, the Threads logo by META is displayed on a smartphone with Twitter logo in the background. Threads is the new social network from Meta Platforms which was launched on the 5th of July 2023.\n\nUser traffic on Twitter has slowed since the launch of Meta 's text-based platform Threads, which has already surpassed 100 million sign-ups since its debut last week.\n\nThreads launched in the U.S. on Wednesday and is being touted by Meta executives like Instagram chief Adam Mosseri as a more positive \"public square\" for communities \"that never really embraced Twitter.\" So far, users seem to be on board.\n\n\"Threads reached 100 million sign ups over the weekend. That's mostly organic demand and we haven't even turned on many promotions yet. Can't believe it's only been 5 days!\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post Monday.\n\nTwitter appears to have taken a hit. Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare, shared a screenshot to Twitter Sunday showing that traffic on the platform was \"tanking.\"\n\nAccording to Similarweb, a data company that specializes in web analytics, web traffic to Twitter was down 5% for the first two full days Threads was generally available compared with the previous week. The company said Twitter's web traffic is down 11% compared with the same days in 2022.\n\nTwitter responded to CNBC's request for comment with an automated response. Meta didn't offer additional comment beyond Zuckerberg's post.\n\nThe booming growth on Threads is helped by the fact that it is tied to an existing social network, Meta's Instagram. Users can sign up with their existing handles on Instagram and are able to retain some of their following as others sign up for the app.\n\nThreads reached the 100 million milestone even faster than OpenAI's generative chatbot ChatGPT, which surpassed 100 million monthly users in two months.\n\nThe app still has lots of room to grow, having not yet launched in Europe, where Mosseri said there is still some regulatory complexity to navigate. If Threads is able to retain its userbase, it could solidify its position as a real competitor for Twitter, which reported nearly 238 million monetizable daily active users in its last quarterly earnings report as public company last summer.\n\nTwitter owner Elon Musk appears to have already shown some concern about Threads, as his longtime lawyer Alex Spiro wrote a letter to Meta accusing the company of \"unlawful misappropriation\" of trade secrets.\n\nMusk and Zuckerberg were also taking shots at one another over the weekend, as Zuckerberg mocked Musk's tweet style and Musk called Zuckerberg a derogatory name.",

        "content": "Instagram’s text-based app Threads has achieved the mark of 100 million signups in just five days, according to a tracker. The Twitter rival was launched on July 6 (or July 5 in the Americas)\n\nAdam Mosseri, Instagram’s head, also confirmed the milestone.\n\n“100 million people signed up for Threads in five days. I’m not sure I can wrap my mind around that fact. It’s insane; I can’t make sense of it,” he said.\n\n“The team has been busting their ass, but we know this is a race to the starting line. They say “make it work, make it great, make it grow.” Well, we certainly did things out of order, but I promise we will make this thing great.”\n\nMark Zuckerberg noted on the first day that the app attracted 2 million signups in two hours, 5 million signups in four hours and 10 million registered users in seven hours. The next morning, the CEO of Meta noted that more than 30 million people had signed up to try the new app. Threads’ growth is noteworthy given that it hasn’t even launched in the EU yet because of privacy reasons.\n\nUntil now, OpenAI’s ChatGPT bot had the distinction of being one of the fastest-growing consumer products by achieving 10 million daily users in 40 days and 100 million monthly users in nearly two months. Given that this is the first month for Threads, it has already crossed the milestone of 100 million monthly active users. But keeping users on the platform will be the real challenge.\n\nWhile many folks are trying out Meta’s new text-focused social platform, there are some missing features. Notably, the app doesn’t have support for ActivityPub — the protocol used for posts on decentralized networks. While Meta said it is working on it, until the integration rolls out, the app won’t really be part of the fediverse.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nApart from that, the app has a read-only web interface, no support for post search, direct messages or hashtags, and no “Following” feed. Because of Instagram’s rules, the app doesn’t allow nudity on its platform — something which fellow Twitter alternative Bluesky embraces.\n\nNevertheless, reaching 100 million users in such a short time is no small feat. So it looks like Threads is here to stay.\n\nThe story has been updated with Adam Mosseri’s comments.\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2023/07/06/what-is-instagrams-threads-app-all-your-questions-answered/?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=WPunit",

        "content": "New York CNN —\n\nTwo weeks after Meta launched its Twitter competitor Threads and received an unprecedented amount of user signups, the frenzy around the app appears to have come back to Earth.\n\nAfter surpassing 100 million user sign-ups in less than a week, user engagement on Threads has slowed. Threads daily active users fell from 49 million on July 7, two days after its launch, to 23.6 million users last Friday, according to a report published this week by web traffic analysis firm Similarweb. The app’s average usage time also fell from 21 minutes to 6 minutes over the same timeframe.\n\nThe slowdown hints at the challenges ahead for Meta as it looks to not only draw users away from Twitter but build a service that reaches a far larger audience. Threads is already facing some of the common issues that often plague social media platforms, including user retention, spam and some early regulatory scrutiny around its approach to content moderation. It’s also not clear yet how much Meta’s investments in building Threads will actually amount to financial returns for the company.\n\n“I’m very optimistic about how the Threads community is coming together,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on the platform Monday. “Early growth was off the charts, but more importantly 10s of millions of people now come back daily … The focus for the rest of the year is improving the basics and retention.”\n\nMeta executives acknowledged in the early days after Threads’ launch that getting users to sign up for a buzzy new app is much easier than convincing them to continue engaging there long-term. That’s likely even more true for Threads, which launched as a relatively bare-bones app in an effort to capitalize on a moment of weakness at Twitter and also tapped into Instagram’s network to ease the sign-in process.\n\nThreads on Tuesday rolled out its first batch of updates to the iOS version of the app, including a translation button, a tab on users’ activity feed dedicated to showing who’s followed them and the option to subscribe and receive notifications from accounts a user doesn’t follow.\n\nInstagram head Adam Mosseri, who is overseeing the Threads launch, has also hinted at plans to add features such as a desktop version of the app, a feed of only accounts a user follows and an edit button. “We’re clearly way out over our skis on this,” Mosseri said in a Threads post the week of the app’s launch.\n\nIn the meantime, Threads is grappling with a common social media issue — spam. Users have complained of replies to posts filling up with spammy links and offering “giveaways” in exchange for new followers. And on Monday, Mosseri said in a Threads post that the platform was “going to have to get tighter on things like rate limits” because “spam attacks have picked up.”\n\nThis “is going to mean more unintentionally limiting active people (false positives),” Mosseri warned. “If you get caught up [in] those protections let us know.”\n\nMeta declined to clarify whether Mosseri’s post refers to limits on users’ ability to post or read content, or to provide any additional details. But the comment did prompt some snark from Twitter owner Elon Musk, after backlash to Twitter’s own rate limits — restrictions on how many tweets users can read — helped propel Threads’ early growth.\n\nUncertain impact on Meta’s business\n\nMeta shares have jumped more than 6% since the Threads launch, but some analysts who follow the company are skeptical that Threads will quickly contribute to the company’s bottom line, if at all.\n\nThreads could be a way for Meta to eke additional engagement time out of its massive existing user base. The app could also ultimately supplement Meta’s core advertising business, which could use a boost after facing challenges from a broad decline in the online ad market and changes to Apple’s app privacy practices.\n\nMeta executives have said they will likely incorporate advertising into the platform, once its user base has reached critical mass. But even if Threads continues to add users, “advertisers could be hesitant and possibly wait before allocating ad dollars to Threads because of their uncertainty about long-run user retention and engagement,” Morningstar senior equity analyst Ali Mogharabi said in a recent investor note.\n\nLike Twitter, Threads could also struggle to attract advertisers because the nature of a real-time news and public conversations app means the content is sometimes negative or controversial. Even before Musk took over Twitter and alienated advertisers, the platform represented a tiny piece of the ad sales market compared to Meta’s properties.\n\nThreads, however, likely has a leg up on Twitter because Meta is known as a company that provides clear value for advertisers, said Scott Kessler, global tech sector lead at research firm Third Bridge. If anything, he said, the risk may be that some advertisers may think twice about spending on yet another Meta platform versus diversifying their ad strategy.\n\nFor now, analysts will be awaiting Meta executives’ commentary about Threads during its quarterly earnings call next week, including to see if they offer any hints about whether ads may be rolled out on the app ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season.\n\n“They launched this in July,” Kessler said. “That should give them enough time to build out sufficient tools for holiday shopping season advertising.”",

        "content": "Meta has an unprecedented and unexpected opportunity to turn its new ad-free Twitter-like service Threads into the “purest form” of social media. The cost of doing so, however, is steep: Operating the app as a loss leader alongside the company’s other social media brands including Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe advice to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is from Eric Wittman, president of VSCO, a social media app that gained brief popularity in 2019. He adds: “Don’t see this as an opportunity to generate direct revenue. See it as an opportunity to generate goodwill, with the billions of people on the planet.”\n\nMeta premiered Threads earlier this month as an alternative to Elon Musk’s Twitter, which has since changed its name to X. It gained immediate momentum with 30 million sign ups in its first day and 100 million within a week. But in its second week, Threads’ daily active users fell by 70%, according to the Wall Street Journal. Wittman believes social media apps like Threads, Twitter, and Facebook, all start out with the intention of connecting people but then lose their way once they start juicing their algorithms to incentivize users to spend more time on the platform.\n\n“Meta has a pattern when they have an app,” Wittman tells Fortune in an interview. “Usually it’s free for a while, then the algorithms start to get implemented and people’s behavior tends to get changed or manipulated. Then the ads come—that’s where it generally kind of turns into more of a problem.”\n\nTo boost engagement, social platforms end up prioritizing content that drives clicks above all else, regardless of the consequences it might have on users. “Content that tends to be more provocative, more negative ends up driving more engagement and keeping people more active on the application,” Wittman says. “It’s not healthy.”\n\nVSCO, which became known for its user base of female teens, known as VSCO girls, doesn’t feature ads. Instead it sells users memberships to access upgraded features.\n\nThings “delove” as Wittman put it, once social media companies are faced with the economic reality of having to sell ads. And it’s a very lucrative reality. Meta had $59.6 billion in ad sales during the first sixth months of this year. Wittman compared the company to the television business, where “it’s all about eyeballs.”\n\nThe goodwill of prioritizing “the health and well-being of the online community, especially younger folks” over an algorithm that promotes engagement—even in its most toxic forms—wouldn’t just extend to the general public, according to Wittman, but also to lawmakers who have called for regulating social media. Keeping Threads ad-free could “give under-informed folks across the political scale a better understanding of how this can be healthy and how it can be helpful,” he says.\n\nPublic officials have become more pointed in their criticisms of social media’s downsides. In May, the Surgeon General’s office released an advisory about social media’s harmful effects on youth mental health. In the U.S., lawmakers from both political parties have been critical of Meta since its role in the 2016 Cambridge Analytica scandal. A U.N. report in 2018 said Facebook’s algorithms played a “determining” role in promoted ethnic violence against the Rohingya in Myanmar; a similar accusation was leveled at WhatsApp when it became a breeding ground for anti-Muslim hate crimes in India.\n\nBoth Zuckerberg and head of Instagram Adam Mosseri have said Threads will remain ad-free for the foreseeable future. “Our approach will be the same as all our other products,” Zuckerberg wrote in a Threads post earlier this month. “Make the product work well first, then see if we can get it on a clear path to 1 billion people, and only then think about monetization at that point.”\n\nWittman hopes Zuckerberg and Meta keep that approach even past the one billion user mark. “Really why Mark started Facebook—or The Facebook back in the day—was just to connect people in a healthy and positive way,” he says.",

        "content": "Meta Platforms (META -0.19%) has been a mover and a shaker in this artificial intelligence (AI) boom. You may know the company best for its social media apps, from Facebook and Messenger to WhatsApp and Instagram, but Meta also has put a significant focus on AI and aims to become a giant in this industry. The company has poured billions of dollars into AI research and recently launched a new unit, Meta Superintelligence Labs.\n\nThe company is set to report quarterly earnings on July 30. That's when investors will likely learn more about this AI growth story and of course get a close look at revenue, profit, and more. But that may not be Meta's biggest news. Instead, Meta might make another announcement that will grab investors' attention. My prediction is this could be the tech giant's next major move.\n\nMeta's advertising revenue\n\nBefore I dive in, though, a quick summary of Meta's path in recent times. As always, Meta's social media presence has driven revenue growth quarter after quarter, and this is thanks to advertising. Businesses aiming to reach consumers with their products and services flock to Meta because they know people spend a lot of time on its social media apps. In fact, more than 3.4 billion people use a Meta app daily. As a result, advertising makes up the lion's share of Meta's revenue and over time has delivered enormous growth.\n\nThis has helped Meta increase earnings, growing revenue and profit into the billions of dollars, and even pay a dividend.\n\nMETA Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nNow, with an investment in AI, Meta aims to increase its ad revenue potential by using AI to better target audiences for advertisers. AI tools, such as the Meta virtual assistant, will prompt people to spend more time on the apps, and that may encourage advertisers to boost their ad spending too. On top of this, Meta's development of its own large language model (LLM) could lead to other products and services.\n\nAll of this is exciting, and we'll probably hear more about it during the July 30 report, but my prediction is Meta's next big move may be the announcement of a stock split. For now, Meta is the only Magnificent Seven company -- these are a group of tech stocks that have led market gains -- that hasn't yet executed such an operation.\n\nStock splits are a way to lower the price of a soaring stock without changing anything fundamental about the company. So, market value, valuation, and everything else remain the same. A stock split is simply a mechanical move to lower the price of each individual share, and this is done by issuing more shares to current holders.\n\nWhy a stock split could be a good idea\n\nWhy do I think Meta may announce such a move? The stock not only has soared in recent times -- by about 280% over three years -- but today it trades for more than $700. This level may make it difficult for some investors to access the shares unless they turn to fractional shares, and not all brokerages offer these. On top of this, certain investors hesitate to invest in a stock as it approaches $1,000 or trades at around that level as it represents a psychological barrier. They may consider the stock expensive even if valuation shows the price to be reasonable. These elements could weigh on Meta stock's growth potential.\n\nBy launching a stock split, the company could solve these problems, opening the investment opportunity up to a broader range of investors. At the same time, a stock split often is seen as a sign of confidence, showing that management believes the stock has what it takes to soar again from its new, lower price. Investors love stock splits for these reasons, though it's important to remember that a split itself isn't a reason to buy a stock; it won't act as a catalyst, spurring share gains.\n\nConsidering all of this, I see Meta as ripe for a stock split right now -- and that's why I think announcing such an operation might be its next big move.",

        "content": "Is Threads really a 'Twitter killer'? Here's what we know so far\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAnother day, another new app promising to replace Twitter.\n\nThe hierarchy of text-based social media platforms started looking shaky as soon as Elon Musk took over Twitter last year, and it's only grown more unstable as he continues rolling out abrupt and unpopular changes on the platform.\n\nThat has sparked a host of challengers vying for Twitter's beloved throne, the latest of which is Threads, which was unveiled late Wednesday by Meta, the parent company behind Facebook.\n\nThreads already appears to have a leg up on other Twitter competitors, gaining 30 million users in less than 24 hours.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut could it go all the way, banging the final nail in Twitter's coffin? It may not be so simple.\n\nFirst things first: What makes Threads similar to Twitter?\n\nMeta is positioning Threads as a new space for people to have real-time, public conversations. And though it's tied closely to Instagram (users need an Instagram account to sign up), the user interface looks and feels a lot like Twitter.\n\nThere are buttons to like, repost, reply to or quote a thread. The number of likes and replies on each post is displayed below its content. Accounts can be public or private.\n\nIn terms of function, the app opts for simplicity over flashy new features.\n\nBut it may be because of that fact, rather than in spite of it, that folks are flocking to Threads in droves.\n\nOK, but how is this different from Mastodon, Hive Social, Blue Sky or any of the other Twitter dupes?\n\nThere are two reasons Threads has an edge on those competitors: Data, and scale.\n\nMeta already has more than 3 billion users across its stable of apps (which include Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp), and is making it easy for its existing users to start a new account.\n\nAfter downloading the new app, existing Instagram users have the option of importing standard set-up functions, including their bio, username, profile photo and follow list.\n\nAs of midday Thursday, more than 30 million people had taken that step to join the app, nearly 30 times the number of people who are reportedly active on Mastodon and Post.\n\nThe users include celebrities like chef Gordon Ramsay, actor Zac Efron and pop star Shakira. Brands like Airbnb, Netflix, Marvel Studios and Spotify were using Threads, as were news outlets like CBS, Vox and Vogue.\n\nThe buzz even sent the word \"Threads\" trending on its rival platform, with over 1 million tweets on the subject. Some tech junkies are referring to the newcomer as the \"Twitter killer.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHow does that user volume compare to Twitter?\n\nTwitter doesn't offer regular disclosures of its user numbers, especially since news broke in 2017 that it had long been over-reporting its monthly active user count. The company saw about 326 million active monthly users around that time.\n\nOne thing to note is that Meta's owner, Mark Zuckerberg, could've easily launched Threads around then, or even earlier. He tried to buy Twitter himself back in 2008, but Twitter wouldn't sell.\n\nBusiness Why Twitter is limiting the number of tweets a user can view Why Twitter is limiting the number of tweets a user can view Listen · 3:27 3:27\n\nSince Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion, he has struggled to transform the platform into a profitable venture, slashing the number of employees and implementing erratic policy changes that have alienated some of Twitter's most loyal users.\n\nJust last weekend, Musk announced a temporary cap on the number of tweets that nonpaying users could view each day. Twitter also made it impossible to view tweets unless a user was signed into the platform, a move that was quickly reversed.\n\nEven after months of turmoil, each new policy change sparks a wave of tweets about leaving the platform, all at a time when advertising spending has cratered at Twitter, dropping nearly 60% from a year ago.\n\nMusk has not yet responded to NPR's request for comment on the Threads launch, but he previously referred to its sister app, Instagram, as \"weak sauce.\"\n\n\"It is infinitely preferable to be attacked by strangers on Twitter, than indulge in the false happiness of hide-the-pain Instagram,\" he wrote in a tweet Thursday.\n\nWhat would it take for a new app to truly beat out Twitter?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThreads is facing modern market challenges that an early Twitter didn't have to reckon with.\n\nEscalating data privacy concerns blocked the app from launching in the European Union and are already sparking headlines across the U.S..\n\nThe app's financial stability is also in question. Meta has laid off tens of thousands of workers as the tech industry as a whole slows down and Zuckerberg in particular continues to invest billions in his virtual reality venture, the Metaverse.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThreads doesn't currently display ads, but Zuckerberg said the switch to monetization would happen once the platform is running smoothly and \"on a clear path to 1 billion people.\"\n\nAnd then there's the fractured market share, the mess of apps vying to take Twitter's place.\n\nThreads says it's aiming to have the app work in the so-called \"fediverse,\" the federated universe of apps that share similar communication rules. This might be especially appealing to creators or those with a large following who are hesitant to start over on a new platform.\n\nBut in the end, the element that might make or break Threads could be outside its control: whether its users build it into the culture they're craving.\n\nCan Threads recreate Twitter's role as the public square?\n\nIn some of his earliest missives on the platform, Zuckerberg said he was focused on making Threads \"a friendly place,\" adding that that would \"ultimately be the key to its success.\"\n\n\"That's one reason why Twitter never succeeded as much as I think it should have, and we want to do it differently,\" he wrote.\n\nTech junkies might counter that Zuckerberg has played (and lost) this game before. He tried to replicate the ephemerality of Snapchat with Facebook's Stories feature, or the compulsive scroll of TikTok with Instagram's Reels. Neither feature successfully bested out the competition.\n\nWhen it comes to getting users in the habit of posting on Threads, one of the app's biggest weaknesses may be the very thing that might make the launch a success: the strength of the Meta brand.\n\nTech analyst Faine Greenwood of Tarentum Consulting calls it the \"terrible uncle problem.\"\n\n\"The terrible uncle problem is the issue that comes about when all of your relatives, your colleagues, your high school classmates are able to find you on social media,\" Greenwood told NPR's Bobby Allyn on NPR's Morning Edition. \"Younger people, especially, are turned off a platform where they feel like they have to censor what they're saying.\"\n\nShe added, \"They don't want to have to deal with literally everybody they know\" being in their social spaces.",

        "content": "Edits has had another update, this time with a brand-new royalty free music offering.\n\nMeta continues to build on its promise to enhance video creation tools with the latest updates to its Edits app. The new features give users more creative freedom and better control, helping to make content that stands out – especially on platforms like Instagram and Facebook, where video performs best.\n\nThe Edits app, which launched earlier this year, is Meta’s answer to the growing demand for simple but powerful mobile editing tools. When Instagram unveiled Edits, the goal was to provide users with quick access to essential creative features without needing third-party tools. Since then, regular updates have expanded its offering.\n\nOne of the most exciting new additions is a royalty-free music discovery tab. Users can now easily browse and select tracks that are safe to use for monetised content. As Social Media Today explains, “creators now [can] switch over to the ‘Royalty free’ tab to select from a listing of tracks that they can use without licensing.” This means no more last-minute edits or muted posts due to copyright issues, especially when promoting content.\n\nAnother upgrade comes to the app’s keyframe editing tools. While Edits introduced keyframe editing recently, this update improves how creators can apply and control elements like stickers, text, and cutouts with precision. It’s a major step towards giving users more detailed control over how their video content flows. For now, this feature is available only on iOS.\n\nFinally, Edits now includes 10 new voice effects, giving users more fun and expressive audio options – from ghostly sounds to robotic tones. This follows earlier voice feature expansions back in May.\n\nMeta’s regular updates prove it’s serious about growing Edits into a creative hub. As Social Media Today highlights, “Meta has followed through on this, and released weekly feature updates for the app.”\n\nIf you’re looking to create high-quality video content without the hassle, Edits from Instagram is quickly becoming a go-to tool.\n\nGet more updates on social media, content creation and more by checking out the RouteNote blog.",

        "content": "New York CNN —\n\nFacebook-parent Meta officially launched its Twitter competitor, Threads, last Wednesday, after first confirming its plans for the app just three months ago.\n\nThreads is already off to a strong start: it received 100 million sign-ups in less than a week, the app shows, including a large number of brands, celebrities, journalists and many other prominent accounts.\n\nThe mood on Threads on the night of its launch felt a bit like the first day of school, with early adopters rushing to try out the app and write their first posts — and some questioning whether the app could end up being the “Twitter killer.” As of Thursday morning, Threads was the top free app on Apple’s App Store and a top trending topic on Twitter.\n\nThreads could pose a serious threat to Twitter, which has faced backlash since Elon Musk took over the platform in October 2022 and has run it with a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants approach. But Twitter has become particularly vulnerable in recent days, angering users over a temporary limit on how much content users can view each day. And for Meta, Threads could further expand its empire of popular apps and provide a new platform on which to sell ads.\n\nHere is everything we know so far about Meta’s Threads:\n\nWhat is Threads?\n\nThreads is a new app from the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The platform looks a lot like Twitter, with a feed of largely text-based posts — although users can also post photos and videos — where people can have real-time conversations.\n\nMeta said messages posted to Threads will have a 500-character limit. Similar to Twitter, users can reply to, repost and quote others’ Threads posts. But the app also blends Instagram’s existing aesthetic and navigation system, and offers the ability to share posts from Threads directly to Instagram Stories.\n\nThread accounts can also be listed as public or private. Verified Instagram accounts are automatically verified on Threads.\n\n“The vision for Threads is to create an option and friendly public space for conversation,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Threads post following the launch. “We hope to take what Instagram does best and create a new experience around text, ideas, and discussing what’s on your mind.”\n\nSome users did experience occasional glitches and issues getting content to load in the early hours after Threads launched, but that is to be expected when millions of users are joining and using an app at once.\n\nHow do you sign up? (And can you leave?)\n\nUsers sign up through their Instagram accounts and keep the same username, password and account name, although they can edit their bio to be unique to Threads. Users can also import the list of accounts they follow directly from Instagram, making it super easy to get up and running on the app.\n\nBut it’s not quite so easy to leave Threads. While users can temporarily deactivate their profiles via the settings section on the app, the company says in its privacy policy that “your Threads profile can only be deleted by deleting your Instagram account.” Some users have also raised concerns about the amount of data that the Threads, like Instagram, can collect about users, including location, contacts, search history, browsing history, contact info and more, according to the Apple App Store.\n\nWhere is Threads available?\n\nThreads is available in 100 countries and more than 30 languages via Apple’s iOS and Android, according to the company.\n\nCould Threads be the ‘Twitter killer’?\n\nThreads is just the latest platform launched in recent months in hopes of unseating Twitter as the go-to app for real-time, public conversations. But it may have the greatest chance at success.\n\nMany Twitter users have expressed desire for an alternative since Musk took over the platform late last year. Frequent technical issues and policy changes have sent some noteworthy Twitter users heading for the exits.\n\nMeta has at least one significant leg up on Twitter: the size of its existing user base. Meta is hoping to capture at least some of its more than 2 billion global active Instagram users with the new app. That’s compared to Twitter’s active user base, which is somewhere around 250 million.\n\n“It’ll take some time, but I think there should be a public conversations app with 1 billion+ people on it,” Zuckerberg said in a Threads post. “Twitter has had the opportunity do this but hasn’t nailed it. Hopefully we will.”\n\nOn Wednesday, a lawyer representing Twitter sent a letter to Meta alleging intellectual property theft and threatening a lawsuit over Threads. Meta pushed back at the allegations.\n\nAnd in a tweet on Thursday, Twitter’s new CEO Linda Yaccarino appeared to acknowledge the rival app’s launch, calling Twitter “irreplaceable.”\n\n“We’re often imitated — but the Twitter community can never be duplicated,” she said.\n\nMeta’s existing scale and infrastructure could play to its advantage. Whereas many of the other Twitter competitors rolled out in recent months have required users to join waitlists or receive invitations to sign up, only to have to work to recreate their network on the new site, Threads makes it remarkably easy for users to get started.\n\nBut Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri noted in a video posted to the platform that the challenge for new social media platforms often is not getting users to sign up, but rather keeping them engaged long-term.\n\nIn particular, Meta will have to work to prevent spam, harassment, conspiracy theories and false claims on Threads, issues that have caused many users to sour on Twitter. The new platform’s launch comes after Meta laid off more than 20,000 workers starting last November, including user experience, well-being, policy and risk analytics employees. It also comes as campaign season for the 2024 US Presidential election ramps up, with some experts warning of an incoming wave of misinformation. Meta says its Community Guidelines will apply to Threads, just like its other apps.\n\nFor Meta, Threads could be a way of eking additional engagement time out of its massive existing user base.\n\nAlthough there are no ads on the platform just yet, Threads could also ultimately supplement Meta’s core advertising business. Meta’s ad business could use a boost after facing challenges from a broad decline in the online ad market and changes to Apple’s app privacy practices, although, if Twitter’s history is any guide, the format is unlikely to attract as many ad dollars as Meta’s other platforms.\n\nFor Zuckerberg, though, the real draw may be in attempting to best his rival, Musk, with whom he has in recent weeks been making plans to engage in a cage fight. Perhaps winning in the battle of social networks is even better.\n\nWhat’s next for Threads?\n\nDespite its early success, Threads remains a relatively bare bones app. It’s still missing many of the features users like about Twitter, such as a desktop version, direct messaging, trending topics and the option to edit posts.\n\nBut Meta executives have already teased plans to continue building out Threads.\n\nMosseri has suggested in Threads posts in recent days that the platform is working to eventually roll out hashtags, a more robust search function, a feed of only accounts a user follows and potentially direct messaging.",

        "content": "Is Trump preparing to cancel America's ride back to the moon?\n\ntoggle caption Joel Kowsky/NASA\n\nA lunar rock sample collected in 1972 by Apollo 17 — the final U.S. moon mission — once held a place of honor on a shelf in President Joe Biden's Oval Office. It was a gift from NASA, meant to symbolize America's dedication to returning astronauts to the moon as part of a program set in motion by his predecessor.\n\nBut as President Trump returned for a second term, the moon rock was removed and sent back to NASA. In his inaugural address last month, Trump didn't mention the moon, either, and instead seemed to echo the sentiments of Elon Musk, head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), vowing that Americans would \"pursue our manifest destiny into the stars\" and \"plant the Stars and Stripes on Mars.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPerhaps more notably, Musk, the founder of SpaceX, has been critical of NASA's Artemis program, which Trump launched in 2017 to send Americans back to the moon to establish a long-term presence.\n\nIn particular, Musk has voiced concerns about the program's massive launch vehicle, the Space Launch System (SLS). In a recent post on X, he called the moon mission a \"distraction,\" stating, \"[W]e're going straight to Mars.\" Trump's pick for NASA administrator, Jared Isaacman, has also questioned the SLS, describing it as \"outrageously expensive.\"\n\nTrump administration appears to shift away from the moon\n\nThe Artemis program has faced significant challenges. This month, Boeing, the lead contractor for the SLS, warned employees that up to 400 jobs could be cut, citing \"revisions to the Artemis program and cost expectations.\"\n\nTodd Harrison, a space policy expert at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, concludes: \"The Artemis program, as envisioned by the first Trump administration, is effectively dead.\"\n\nHarrison suggests that Musk is behind the shift away from the moon.\n\n\"It sounds like this is entirely Elon Musk whispering in the president's ear, saying, 'This is what we've got to do.'\"\n\nNASA has already invested about $40 billion in Artemis. The project was slated to send astronauts around the moon by April 2026 with Artemis II, followed by a lunar landing in 2027. However, delays in the development of the SLS and problems with the Orion crew capsule's heat shield have repeatedly pushed back timetables.\n\nDespite those delays, \"we have never been closer since 1972 to being at the moon with astronauts from America,\" says Thomas Culligan, a consultant and former aerospace lobbyist. \"I think people don't realize just how far along we are into these missions.\"\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nChina would benefit if the U.S. drops Artemis\n\nMeanwhile, China is pushing ahead with plans to send its astronauts to the moon before 2030, and other nations such as Japan and India are also focusing on lunar exploration.\n\nAllen Cutler, president of the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration, warns that if the U.S. abandons Artemis, it would cede the setting of global norms for lunar exploration to China, diminishing America's influence in space.\n\n\"Failing to secure a leadership position on the moon would mean losing ground, not just in space exploration, but in global diplomacy, national security, and economic competitiveness,\" he says.\n\nLaura Forczyk, owner of the space consulting firm Astralytical, shares that concern.\n\n\"Right now, undeniably, China is the leader in lunar science,\" she says. \"That is something that the United States needs to refocus on in order to regain that leadership within the science community.\"\n\nForczyk and others argue that the race to the moon is a marathon, not a sprint. She says it's more important that the U.S. has a sustained presence on the moon — \"a means of staying longer term\" — and goes beyond what was accomplished during Apollo.\n\nThere are also concerns that giving up on Artemis would mean abandoning commitments to the Lunar Gateway project, a collaborative effort between the U.S., Canada, Japan, the European Space Agency and the UAE to establish the first space station around the moon.\n\n\n\nWhere Artemis stands right now\n\nWhile the SLS successfully sent an uncrewed Orion capsule around the moon in 2022, Artemis still doesn't have a way to land, something Musk's SpaceX is supposed to provide. The company's lunar Starship, known as the Human Landing System, has been slow to take shape since the company won the contract in 2021, and it faces some formidable technical challenges — not least of which is a complex orbital refueling procedure that has never been tried.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Elon Musk does do what he says he's going to do, but never on time,\" notes Forczyk. \"So the question is, how long are we going to decide to wait?\"\n\nThere are other options. In 2023, NASA awarded a contract to Blue Origin, led by Jeff Bezos, to develop a lunar lander as a backup to SpaceX's Starship. Blue Origin is reportedly on track to test its vehicle on the moon's surface later this year. However, the company declined to provide NPR with an update on the vehicle's development.\n\nNASA has made substantial progress with Artemis II, with 95% of the hardware for the mission to orbit the moon completed and astronaut training already in progress, according to Cutler. He and others find it hard to believe the program would be abruptly canceled, especially considering how far along the flights are in planning.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine that this president, who established the Artemis program during his first term, would not want to send the first American astronauts to orbit the moon since Apollo,\" says Culligan.\n\nTo be sure, the SLS has allies on both sides of the aisle in Congress. Alabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville, whose state hosts NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and at least 14,000 SLS jobs, told Reuters recently that SLS would \"be fine.\"\n\n\"I know that there's a lot — because of Elon Musk involved in the DOGE situation — there's a lot of rumors out there on that, but I got full confidence on the SLS and the future for them,\" he said.\n\nNew York Democratic Rep. Grace Meng, ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee's commerce, justice and science subcommittee, sent a letter last week to NASA's acting administrator Janet Petro, calling Musk's involvement in any oversight of the space agency a conflict of interest and urging her \"to revoke any access to NASA headquarters for Mr. Musk and his staff.\"\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMusk aims for Mars, but that involves major risks\n\nTim Farrar, president of TMF Associates, a space consultancy, says Musk wants to present \"a grand vision for the future of humanity. And clearly going to Mars is something that's never been done before.\"\n\nBut it's a hugely ambitious and potentially dangerous endeavor. One key argument for going back to the moon, which is just 240,000 miles away, is that it's a good proving ground for Mars, which orbits at an average distance of 142 million miles from Earth.\n\nDuring the Apollo moon missions, for example, NASA was able to minimize astronauts' exposure to radiation because of the limited duration of the missions — the longest of which lasted just 12 days. Going to Mars would mean no chance of rescue or quick return to Earth, with the dangers of greatly increased radiation exposure and adverse effects on astronauts' bodies due to long-term exposure to low gravity and zero gravity.\n\n\"Going out to Mars, you're talking 7 to 9 months to get there and about as much time to get back,\" Harrison says, adding that for radio communications with Mars astronauts it will take \"many minutes for that signal to get there.\"\n\nMusk has said that the first journeys to Mars will be dangerous, suggesting that the astronauts should be prepared to die. SpaceX's development ethos involves blowing up lots of rockets to test and fix problems, something the company refers to as an \"iterative design process.\"\n\n\"Musk is very comfortable with risk ... but we're yet to see how much the general public is comfortable with that risk,\" Farrar says.\n\n\"And what will be the reaction if it all goes wrong?\" he wonders. \"You can't sweep consequences under the carpet when it comes to people in space dying.\"",

        "content": "Teams with NASA and the Department of Defense (DoD) rehearse recovery procedures for a launch pad abort scenario off the coast of Florida near the agency’s Kennedy Space Center on Wednesday, June 11, 2025. NASA/Isaac Watson\n\nNASA and the Department of Defense (DoD) teamed up June 11 and 12 to simulate emergency procedures they would use to rescue the Artemis II crew in the event of a launch emergency. The simulations, which took place off the coast of Florida and were supported by launch and flight control teams, are preparing NASA to send four astronauts around the Moon and back next year as part of the agency’s first crewed Artemis mission.\n\nThe team rehearsed procedures they would use to rescue the crew during an abort of NASA’s Orion spacecraft while the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket is still on the launch pad, as well as during ascent to space. A set of test manikins and a representative version of Orion called the Crew Module Test Article, were used during the tests.\n\nThe launch team at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, flight controllers in mission control at the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, as well as the mission management team, all worked together, exercising their integrated procedures for these emergency scenarios.\n\nTeams with NASA and the Department of Defense (DoD) rehearse recovery procedures for a launch pad abort scenario off the coast of Florida near the agency’s Kennedy Space Center on Wednesday, June 11, 2025. NASA/Isaac Watson\n\n“Part of preparing to send humans to the Moon is ensuring our teams are ready for any scenario on launch day,” said Lakiesha Hawkins, NASA’s assistant deputy associate administrator for the Moon to Mars Program, and who also is chair of the mission management team for Artemis II. “We’re getting closer to our bold mission to send four astronauts around the Moon, and our integrated testing helps ensure we’re ready to bring them home in any scenario.”\n\nThe launch pad abort scenario was up first. The teams conducted a normal launch countdown before declaring an abort before the rocket was scheduled to launch. During a real pad emergency, Orion’s launch abort system would propel Orion and its crew a safe distance away and orient it for splashdown before the capsule’s parachutes would then deploy ahead of a safe splashdown off the coast of Florida.\n\nTeams with NASA and the Department of Defense (DoD) rehearse recovery procedures for a launch pad abort scenario off the coast of Florida near the agency’s Kennedy Space Center on Wednesday, June 11, 2025. NASA/Isaac Watson\n\nFor the simulated splashdown, the test Orion with manikins aboard was placed in the water five miles east of Kennedy. Once the launch team made the simulated pad abort call, two Navy helicopters carrying U.S. Air Force pararescue jumpers departed nearby Patrick Space Force Base. The rescuers jumped into the water with unique DoD and NASA rescue equipment to safely approach the spacecraft, retrieve the manikin crew, and transport them for medical care in the helicopters, just as they would do in the event of an actual pad abort during the Artemis II mission.\n\nThe next day focused on an abort scenario during ascent to space.\n\nThe Artemis recovery team set up another simulation at sea 12 miles east of Kennedy, using the Orion crew module test article and manikins. With launch and flight control teams supporting, as was the Artemis II crew inside a simulator at Johnson, the rescue team sprung into action after receiving the simulated ascent abort call and began rescue procedures using a C-17 aircraft and U.S. Air Force pararescue jumpers. Upon reaching the capsule, the rescuers jumped from the C-17 with DoD and NASA unique rescue gear. In an actual ascent abort, Orion would separate from the rocket in milliseconds to safely get away prior to deploying parachutes and splashing down.\n\nTeams with NASA and the Department of Defense (DoD) rehearse recovery procedures for an ascent abort scenario off the coast of Florida near the agency’s Kennedy Space Center on Thursday, June 12, 2025. NASA/Isaac Watson\n\nRescue procedures are similar to those used in the Underway Recovery Test conducted off the California coast in March. This demonstration ended with opening the hatch and extracting the manikins from the capsule, so teams stopped without completing the helicopter transportation that would be used during a real rescue.\n\nExercising procedures for extreme scenarios is part of NASA’s work to execute its mission and keep the crew safe. Through the Artemis campaign, NASA will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and to build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars – for the benefit of all.",

        "content": "The White House has marked the anniversary of the first crewed mission to the moon by doubling down on its support for Artemis.\n\nIn a new statement, President Donald Trump said his administration had secured a “historic investment in human space exploration” and pledged Americans would return to the moon “this time to stay”.\n\nThe surprise about turn in support will come as a relief to Australia’s space sector, which is now heavily involved in the Artemis program.\n\nTrump’s comments come after his so-called “Big Beautiful Bill”, a US federal statute focused on future spending, was signed into law and pledged US$4.1 billion for two new lunar landings, Artemis 4 and Artemis 5.\n\nThere was also a further US$20 million set aside to procure Lockheed Martin’s Orion space capsule and US$2.6 billion to develop the Lunar Gateway station.\n\nThose projects were in doubt with the administration previously hinting it could cut Artemis and Gateway to focus on collaborations with private firms.\n\nThe backing follows the exit of Elon Musk from Trump’s inner circle, who was also heavily critical of the Artemis program, which he branded “extremely inefficient”.\n\n“On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 successfully landed the first crewed mission on the Moon, launching mankind into a new and uncharted era of human ingenuity,” said Trump.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\n\n“As the entire world watched in awe, American astronauts stepped onto the lunar surface and planted the beautiful Stars and Stripes on the rocky soil.\n\n“Our flag stood as a marker of National achievement, signalling to the entire world the unmatched might and unwavering resilience of the American spirit.\n\n“Today, my Administration is building on the legacy of Apollo 11 by reigniting the United States’ leadership in space and shaping the future of American space exploration.\n\n“During my first term, I proudly reestablished the National Space Council and created the Space Force, making space policy a national priority and ensuring that our Nation’s interests are protected beyond Earth.\n\n“Through the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, we secured a historic investment in human space exploration to ensure that America’s efforts in the realm of space remain innovative, efficient, and unmatched by other nations.\n\n“We are refocusing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Artemis campaign, returning Americans to the Moon – this time to stay – and putting the first boots on Mars.\n\n“At the same time, we are expanding partnerships with the greatest aerospace companies in the world to launch rockets, build landers, and deliver advanced technology that will drive a new and unparalleled era of space exploration.”\n\nArtemis II aims to fly astronauts close to the moon in preparation for the final Artemis III mission that will return humans to the lunar surface.\n\nThe mission is currently scheduled to launch in April 2026 and will carry NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen.\n\nTheir 10-day journey will include flying 4,600 miles beyond the moon and back to Earth. During the voyage, the crew will evaluate the spacecraft’s performance, test its navigation and communication systems, as well as conduct experiments.\n\nThey will also perform a rendezvous operation with the Space Launch System’s upper stage, practising docking activities needed for Artemis III, now scheduled for 2027.\n\nArtemis II, though, has repeatedly faced delays, not least due to a problem with the heat shield on Orion that NASA believes has been fixed.\n\nHowever, earlier this year, Lockheed Martin revealed that it had completed work on the new Orion capsule, which also included new life support systems, controls, and audio communications.",

        "content": "While sharing details of its upcoming long-term national space exploration roadmap this month, KASA, said that it has four exploration areas it will be focusing on: Earth orbit, moon, heliosphere and deep space. Each of these categories will have its own core missions, including one mission to set up a lunar base by the year 2045. The agency says that it plans to develop landing and mobility technologies that are independent of any other agencies. This means South Korea won't be relying on the product of research by NASA's Artemis missions or any other agency's attempts to put humanity back on the Moon.\n\nFurther, KASA noted that it plans to develop a next-generation lunar lander for logistical purposes by 2040. Then, within five more years, it plans to have developed and established a lunar economic base by 2045. From there, the agency hopes to be able to monitor solar activity and enhance space safety as a whole.\n\nThat isn't all, though. The report also notes that South Korea's space agency hopes to develop and deploy a solar observational satellite to the Lagrange Point L4 by 2035, allowing for greater understanding and study of our sun's gravitational effects on Earth. Of course, pulling all of this off before then will take a lot of work, determination, and even some luck. But, if KASA is serious about making its mark on the cosmos, it could make the necessary moves to set up its lunar base and even set its sight on Mars in the future.",

        "content": "KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. – The Artemis I moon rocket successfully launched early Wednesday, starting the Orion spacecraft's journey to orbit the moon and marking a major step toward returning humans to the moon.\n\nBefore the historic launch could happen a specialized team in Florida entered the blast zone of NASA's mega moon rocket to repair a fuel leak amid the space agency's third attempt to send the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft on a test flight known as Artemis 1.\n\nAfter several delays, including the repair at the pad, the SLS rocket roared to life, rumbling away from Kennedy Space Center launchpad 39B with 8.8 million pounds of thrust, beginning a 26-day test flight for the Orion spacecraft to the moon and back.\n\nAt 1:47 a.m. Eastern, the RS-25 rocket engines created a rumble so powerful it could be felt throughout Florida, and the light illuminated the Space Coast.\n\nThe Artemis 1 launch was more than a decade in the making that was at times an uphill battle for the space agency hoping to return astronauts to the moon using the rocket by 2025.\n\n\"We are all part of something incredibly special, the first launch of Artemis, the first step in returning our country to the moon and onto Mars,\" Artemis 1 Launch Director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson told the launch team after liftoff. \"What you've done will inspire the next generation.\"\n\nThe countdown got underway Tuesday, and fueling the 322-foot-tall rocket with more than 750,000 gallons of cryogenic fuel began Tuesday afternoon.\n\nWHAT IS NASA'S ARTEMIS 1 MISSION GOING TO DO?\n\nEarly on, the countdown was going smoothly, but as the launch window approached, the first issues with the SLS began to arise.\n\nThe rocket must slowly be filled with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellant. Hydrogen, a tiny molecule, has created problems for NASA during the last launch attempts. To avoid leaks, Blackwell-Thompson said the team would take a \"kinder, gentler\" approach to tank the rocket.\n\nTwo previous launch attempts – one in late August and the other in September – ended in launch scrubs due to technical issues with fueling the rocket with super-cold liquid hydrogen, which commonly leaks.\n\nYet another liquid hydrogen leak was discovered around 9 p.m., which required a high-risk operation by Red Team technicians to head to the launch pad to physically repair the leaking valve.\n\nTwo technicians and a safety team member entered the blast zone for about an hour to tighten the bolts on the mobile launch tower. The Red Team's work prevailed, and NASA again began replenishing the liquid hydrogen fuel on the rocket.\n\n\"Thank you to the red crew for their hard work and bravery to work in this environment,\" NASA Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems Development Jim Free tweeted.\n\nAround the same time, the space agency learned from the U.S. Space Force a radar asset required for liftoff was down. Less than two hours before the 1:04 a.m. launch window opened, the range was \"NO GO\" while the Space Force worked to remedy this issue involving a \"bad Ethernet switch.\"\n\nThe Space Force replaced the switch, and as the launch window opened, NASA set a new liftoff time of 1:47 a.m.\n\nnext Image 1 of 9\n\nprev next Image 2 of 9\n\nprev next Image 3 of 9\n\nprev next Image 4 of 9\n\nprev next Image 5 of 9\n\nprev next Image 6 of 9\n\nprev next Image 7 of 9\n\nprev next Image 8 of 9\n\nprev Image 9 of 9\n\nDuring the countdown, managers took time to discuss a problem caused by Hurricane Nicole when the rocket was out on the launchpad during the storm.\n\nSome room-temperature vulcanizing material (RTV) – or silicone caulking – came loose off the base of the Orion spacecraft during the storm. The RTV could not be repaired before the launch because it's impossible to access it while the 322-foot-tall rocket is on the launchpad.\n\nNASA managers previously approved launching with the loose RTV, but the issue came up again during the countdown when a sensor detected more of the material was loose. Again after an extensive review, NASA management agreed to move forward with the countdown and that the material would not pose a risk to the SLS.\n\nAfter two previous launch attempts and dealing with delays from hurricanes Ian and Nicole, NASA managers said they were confident that this time, everything would line up for the mega moon rocket designed to return humans to the moon by 2025.\n\n\"We're going to go when we're ready. We're learning the systems of this vehicle,\" Free told reporters earlier this week.\n\nOrion begins journey to the moon\n\nThe SLS used more than 8.8 million pounds of thrust to begin Orion's journey around the moon.\n\nOrion was in Earth orbit soon after launch and completed a trans-lunar injection burn, sending the spacecraft on the way to the moon.\n\nNASA confirmed all four of Orion's solar arrays deployed and were producing power.\n\nAbout 10 small spacecraft will be deployed in orbit as secondary payloads on the spaceflight to the moon. There are also manikins inside the spacecraft wearing special vests to examine the effects of radiation on future astronaut passengers.\n\nMEET THE MANIKINS THAT WILL HITCH A RIDE ON NASA’S MOON ROCKET\n\nOrion will travel about 40,000 miles beyond the moon's far side, farther than any human-rated spacecraft. This lunar orbit is known as the distance retrograde orbit or DRO.\n\nThe Artemis 1 test flight culminates with Orion's splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on Dec. 11.\n\nBeautiful launch weather\n\nThe weather continued to be nearly perfect for a rocket launch that requires no rain, low wind speeds and specific temperatures.\n\nForecasters with the Space Force 45th Weather Squadron predicted a 90% chance of favorable launch conditions for liftoff.\n\nThe forecast dropped to 80% earlier in the day, but some clouds around the launchpad cleared later Tuesday night, allowing launch weather officers to improve their predictions again.\n\nHOW TO WATCH THE ARTEMIS 1 LAUNCH ONLINE AND ON FLORIDA'S SPACE COAST\n\nLaunch viewers enjoyed pleasant temperatures in the 70s with winds around 10 mph. Coastal showers remained far enough offshore and shouldn't interfere with the launch Wednesday.\n\nDespite the early-hour liftoff, Florida's Space Coast was bustling with people hoping to witness the history of NASA's mega moon rocket taking off for the first time. Launch viewers were encouraged to arrive earlier at their selected spot and expect traffic on State Road 528 and NASA Causeway.\n\nAccording to the Brevard Emergency Operations Center, popular launch viewing locations at parks in Merritt Island and Titusville were \"packed\" hours before the launch window opened.\n\nThe powerful SLS produced a rumble heard around Florida as it moved away from the peninsula.",

        "content": "Recently, NASA tested a payload adapter at the Marshall Space Flight Center as part of the preparation for the upcoming Artemis IV mission.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe massive, dark circular payload adapter was carefully lowered from Test Stand 4697 to Test Stand 4705 for storage, after successfully completing initial structural tests. The next stage is for flight engineers to run quality checks on the adapter before building the final device.\n\nThe payload adapter plays an important role in spacecraft launches, as it connects the spacecraft or satellite to a launch vehicle. Without an adapter, the two parts of the spacecraft can't interface.\n\nWhere is it?\n\nThe payload adapter was initially tested and is being stored at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nThe large payload adapter is moved via crane into storage. (Image credit: NASA/Sam Lott)\n\nWhy is it amazing?\n\nThe payload adapter is just one piece of equipment that is being tested as part of NASA's planned Artemis IV mission. This crewed lunar mission will focus on the first lunar space station, Gateway, according to NASA. The international hub will allow astronauts to study both the moon and the planets beyond, especially Mars.\n\nTo get the astronauts to Gateway, NASA plans to launch the crew using the Orion spacecraft with an upgraded SLS rocket. Before that happens, all launch materials, from boosters to payload adapters, have to be thoroughly tested and cleared for takeoff.\n\nWant to learn more?\n\nYou can read more about the upcoming Artemis IV mission and the Gateway hub on the moon.",

        "content": "The Artemis 1 moon mission launches from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Nov. 16, 2022.\n\nThe Trump administration wants to give NASA's Artemis moon program a serious facelift.\n\nThe White House's proposed 2026 \"skinny budget,\" which was released today (May 2), would fundamentally reshape Artemis, which aims to establish a sustainable human presence on and around the moon by the end of the 2020s.\n\nThe budget would cut NASA's \"legacy human exploration systems\" funding by $879 million and phase out the agency's Space Launch System (SLS) moon rocket and Orion capsule — Artemis' current backbone — after just two more flights. It would also immediately cancel Gateway, the small space station NASA aims to build in lunar orbit to support Artemis operations.\n\n\"SLS alone costs $4 billion per launch and is 140% over budget,\" the skinny budget document reads. \"The Budget funds a program to replace SLS and Orion flights to the moon with more cost-effective commercial systems that would support more ambitious subsequent lunar missions.\"\n\nThose commercial systems would presumably be provided by SpaceX and/or Blue Origin, both of which are already working on crewed lunar landers for use on Artemis missions and rockets that could get astronauts very far afield (Starship in SpaceX's case, and New Glenn for Blue Origin).\n\nSLS and Orion have flown once together to date — on Artemis 1, a 25-day flight that sent an uncrewed Orion to lunar orbit and back in late 2022.\n\nThe duo's next two flights — which will be their last, if the budget proposal is enacted by Congress — will both be crewed. Artemis 2, targeted to launch in spring 2026, will send four astronauts around the moon. Artemis 3 will land people near the moon's south pole in 2027, if all goes according to plan.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

Some progress toward this goal has been made; for example, the station's main habitation module, known as HALO, arrived in the United States last month from Italy, where it was built.\n\nThe skinny budget — a pared-down summary of the full 2026 budget request — is a rough one for many other NASA programs as well. Overall, the White House proposal cuts the space agency's funding by $6 billion from enacted 2025 levels, a reduction of nearly 25%.\n\nThat would be the biggest single-year cut in NASA's history, according to The Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization that advocates for space exploration.\n\nThe budget would cut space science and Earth science by $2.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The proposal ends NASA's Mars sample return program and \"eliminates funding for low-priority climate monitoring satellites,\" among other impacts.\n\nThese and other NASA cuts are \"in line with the Administration’s objectives of returning to the moon before China and putting a man on Mars,\" according to the budget document.",

        "content": "NASA's Artemis 1 unmanned lunar rocket lifts off from Kennedy Space Center at the start of its 25-day lunar mission.\n\nNASA launched the most powerful rocket ever built on a journey to the Moon on Wednesday, in a spectacular blaze of light and sound that marked the start of the space agency's new flagship program, Artemis.\n\nThe 32-story tall Space Launch System (SLS) blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 01:47 am (0647 GMT), producing a record 8.8 million pounds (39 meganewtons) of thrust.\n\n\"What you have done today will inspire generations to come, thank you!\" Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA's first female launch director, told cheering teammates.\n\nFixed to the rocket's top was the uncrewed Orion spaceship that will orbit Earth's nearest neighbor, in a test run for later flights that should see the first woman and first person of color touch down on lunar soil by the mid-2020s.\n\nAbout two hours after launch, NASA said the spacecraft was on its trajectory to the Moon, and later released the first images taken of Earth receding behind the craft.\n\n\"Now we are going back to the Moon, not just for the sake of going to the Moon, but to learn how to live on the Moon in order to prepare to send humans all the way to Mars,\" NASA administrator Bill Nelson told a news conference after the launch.\n\n\"This is the next beginning, this is the Artemis generation,\" added Nelson, who said he watched the launch from the roof of the rocket assembly building along with a group of astronauts.\n\nAmerica last sent astronauts to the Moon during the Apollo era, from 1969-1972.\n\nThis time it hopes to build a sustained presence—including a lunar space station—to help prepare for an eventual mission to Mars in the 2030s.\n\nThere were nervous moments as teams worked to overcome technical issues that ate into the two-hour launch window, which opened at 1:04 am.\n\nFirst, engineers were forced to pause the flow of liquid hydrogen into the core stage Tuesday night because of a valve leak, but a team sent to the launch pad resolved the issue after about an hour, by tightening loose bolts.\n\nLater, the space agency reported that a radar site monitoring the rocket's flight path was experiencing problems due to a faulty ethernet switch, which had to be replaced.\n\nIt was third time lucky for NASA after two previous launch attempts were canceled for technical reasons. The launch was also delayed due to weather setbacks including Hurricane Ian, which battered Florida in late September.\n\nSchematic outline of the NASA's Artemis I voyage, rescheduled for November 16.\n\n'Extremely excited'\n\nAbout 100,000 people were expected to have gathered along the coast to witness the historic event.\n\nTodd Garland drove from Frankfurt, Kentucky to watch from Cocoa Beach.\n\nWearing an Artemis T-shirt, the 55-year-old told AFP tearfully: \"This has been an experience I've looked forward to all my life.\n\n\"My first memory is my mother waking me up at two years old to watch the Moon landing and I've always wanted to see a launch ever since, and now I have.\"\n\nKerry Warner, 59, a grandmother and semi-retired educator who lives in Florida, added the launch was \"part of America and what America is all about.\"\n\nFar side of the Moon\n\nThe Orion crew capsule was lifted by two boosters and four powerful engines under the core stage, which detached after just a few minutes.\n\nA final push from the upper stage set the capsule on its way to the Moon, though it will take several days to reach its destination.\n\nThe smoke trail of the Artemis I is seen after lifting off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, in Titusville, Florida.\n\nThe upper stage will meanwhile release 10 CubeSats to carry out science experiments, including one that will unfurl a sail-powered by sunlight and perform asteroid reconnaissance work.\n\nRather than landing on the Moon, Orion will assume a distant orbit, venturing 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers) beyond the far side—further than any other habitable spacecraft so far.\n\nFinally, the spaceship will embark on the return leg of its journey. When passing through the atmosphere, the capsule's heat shield will need to withstand a temperature half as hot as the Sun's surface.\n\nAbout 100,000 people gathered along the coast to witness the historic event.\n\nThough Orion isn't carrying humans this time, it has three sensor-equipped dummies on board to help gather safety data for future crew members.\n\nThe mission will last 25-and-a-half days, with a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on December 11.\n\nEngineers work on the Tail Service Mast Umbilical of the Artemis I unmanned lunar rocket as it sits on launch pad 39B at NASA's Kennedy Space Center.\n\nNASA is banking on a successful mission after developing the SLS rocket for more than a decade.\n\nIt will have invested more than $90 billion in its new lunar program by the end of 2025, according to a public audit.\n\nArtemis 2 will involve a flyby of the Moon with astronauts in 2024, while Artemis 3 will see boots on lunar soil, no sooner than 2025.\n\nNASA hopes to settle into a yearly launch schedule, and will include international partners from Japan, Canada and Europe.\n\n© 2022 AFP",

        "content": "Better understanding the lunar lighting environment will help NASA prepare astronauts for the harsh environment Artemis III Moonwalkers will experience on their mission. NASA’s Artemis III mission will build on earlier test flights and add new capabilities with the human landing system and advanced spacesuits to send the first astronauts to explore the lunar South Pole and prepare humanity to go to Mars.\n\nUsing high-intensity lighting and low-fidelity mock-ups of a lunar lander, lunar surface, and lunar rocks, NASA engineers are simulating the Moon’s environment at the Flat Floor Facility to study and experience the extreme lighting condition. The facility is located at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nNASA engineers inside the Flat Floor Facility at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, mimic lander inspection and assessment tasks future Artemis astronauts may do during Artemis III. Lights are positioned at a low angle to replicate the strong shadows that are cast across the lunar South Pole. NASA/Charles Beason\n\n“The goal is really to understand how shadows will affect lander visual inspection and assessment efforts throughout a future crewed mission,” said Emma Jaynes, test engineer at the facility. “Because the Flat Floor Facility is similar to an inverted air hockey table, NASA and our industry partners can rearrange large, heavy structures with ease – and inspect the shadows’ effects from multiple angles, helping to ensure mission success and astronaut safety for Artemis III.”\n\nData and analysis from testing at NASA are improving models Artemis astronauts will use in preparation for lander and surface operations on the Moon during Artemis III. The testing also is helping cross-agency teams evaluate various tools astronauts may use.\n\nThe 86-foot-long by 44-foot-wide facility at NASA is one of the largest, flattest, and most stable air-bearing floors in the world, allowing objects to move across the floor without friction on a cushion of air.\n\nTest teams use large, 12-kilowatt and 6-kilowatt lights to replicate the low-angle, high contrast conditions of the lunar South Pole. Large swaths of fabric are placed on top of the epoxy floor to imitate the reflective properties of lunar regolith. All the mock-ups are placed on air bearings, allowing engineers to easily move and situate structures on the floor.\n\nThe Flat Floor Facility is an air-bearing floor, providing full-scale simulation capabilities for lunar surface systems by simulating zero gravity in two dimensions. Wearing low-fidelity materials, test engineers can understand how the extreme lighting of the Moon’s South Pole could affect surface operations during Artemis III. NASA/Charles Beason\n\n“The Sun is at a permanent low angle at the South Pole of the Moon, meaning astronauts will experience high contrasts between the lit and shadowed regions,” Jaynes said. “The color white can become blinding in direct sunlight, while the shadows behind a rock could stretch for feet and ones behind a lander could extend for miles.”\n\nThe laboratory is large enough for people to walk around and experience this phenomenon with the naked eye, adding insight to what NASA calls ‘human in-the-loop testing.\n\nNASA is working with SpaceX to develop the company’s Starship Human Landing System to safely send Artemis astronauts to the Moon’s surface and back to lunar orbit for Artemis III.\n\nThrough the Artemis campaign, NASA will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and to build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars – for the benefit of all.\n\nFor more information about Artemis missions, visit:\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/artemis\n\nNews Media Contact\n\nCorinne Beckinger\n\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.\n\n256.544.0034\n\ncorinne.m.beckinger@nasa.gov",

        "content": "The Apollo 11 Moon landing in 1969 was a watershed moment in human history, not just with regards to space exploration, but as a defining moment that captured the hearts and imaginations of people across the world. For many, Apollo 11 offered a glimpse into a future of spectacular possibilities, and the decades of technological progress that have transpired since Neil Armstrong’s first small step have made a return to the Moon a seemingly predestined and potentially transformative leap for humanity.\n\nArtemis is an international effort, led by NASA, that aims to return astronauts to the lunar surface by 2025, making way for eventually expanding human space exploration to Mars. The Artemis I mission marks a major milestone for the Artemis mission series, and The Aerospace Corporation is proud to be contributing its unparalleled depth and breadth of technical expertise in support of this ambitious endeavor.\n\nArtemis I is the first in a series of increasingly complex missions and will be a flight test of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket that will send the uncrewed Orion spacecraft on a flight around the Moon.\n\n“Aerospace has been working closely with NASA since the beginning in support of the development of NASA’s launch, spacecraft and ground systems,” said Martha Hess, Principal Director of the Human Exploration and Spaceflight division. “We are excited and thankful to have played a role in helping our nation achieve human exploration goals and return humans to the lunar surface and on to Mars.”\n\nArtemis I on the launch pad at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. (Image courtesy of NASA)\n\nThe Most Powerful Rocket Ever Built\n\nArtemis is groundbreaking in many respects: The SLS will launch the Orion spacecraft farther than any spacecraft built for humans has ever flown and in its Block 1B configuration, will be the largest rocket ever created. The Orion spacecraft, designed to withstand travel beyond the Moon, will remain in space longer than any previous vehicle for astronauts without docking with a space station. Furthermore, the Orion spacecraft will return to Earth faster than previous spacecrafts and will require a higher threshold of heat resistance.\n\nDesigned to carry both astronauts and supplies on a single mission, the SLS will be used to accomplish subsequent Artemis missions, which will include transporting the first woman and the first person of color to the Moon. Aerospace is supporting multiple essential components of the Artemis I mission, the success of which will demonstrate the feasibility of human deep space exploration and permanently raise the bar for future space missions.\n\n“While the increased capability of the SLS over previous launch vehicles is game-changing, the true scale of the SLS is challenging to capture unless you’ve seen it in person,” said Ben Bycroft, Senior Project Leader of Aerospace’s Vehicle Engineering department. “Standing at the base of the SLS, looking up and realizing that it’s twice as tall as other current vehicles is pretty awe-inspiring.”\n\nThe SLS has been designed specifically for missions beyond low-Earth orbit carrying crew or cargo to the Moon and beyond. Propelled by a pair of five segment boosters, four core stage engines, and the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) the SLS represents the next generation of launch systems, requiring intensive design certification and review for all of its blocks and stages. To accomplish this, an Aerospace team dedicated to systems engineering and structural dynamics of the SLS provided extensive analysis of the SLS’ technical details to ensure that the design was accurate, and that all requirements of the vehicle and mission were met.\n\nTo the Moon, Mars and Beyond\n\nAccomplishing Artemis mission objectives requires failure-proof software and hardware, and extensive testing was necessary to ensure that the SLS’ on-board software is as reliable as possible. To attain that standard, an Aerospace team was tasked with providing Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) of the ICPS flight software and guidance, navigation and control (GN&C) capabilities.\n\nThe verification and validation of software is a systems engineering process, which helps the development organization build quality into software during the software lifecycle. Validation is accomplished by checking that the software meets the user's needs, and verification is accomplished by checking that the system is well-engineered. This is sometimes expressed as \"Are we building the right system?\" and \"Are we building the system right?\"\n\n“To say that the Artemis mission series is ambitious is an understatement,” said Joseph Lacey, Senior Project Engineer in the Human Exploration and Spaceflight division. “Just like Aerospace’s contributions to other components of this project, our work on the IV&V of the ICPS flight software and GNC has to be above reproach to ensure the success of the Artemis I mission, and to create a solid foundation for the future. It’s really exciting to be part of the effort to make that happen.”\n\nAs part of its commitment to the project’s success, Aerospace provided its technical expertise and support to a wide range of components of the Artemis I mission, from avionics to programmatic assessments, with more work planned to ensure future Artemis milestones.\n\nNASA’s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate’s (ESDMD) Common Exploration Systems Development Division (CESD) is responsible for the development, test, integration, and delivery of the Nation’s next generation of human exploration systems. CESD is responsible for the overall systems integration, program planning and control, and mission operations of the SLS, Orion, and Exploration Ground Systems programs.\n\nOne way Aerospace supports CESD is using strategic assessments, one of many mechanisms and tools used to inform effective decision-making when integrating Artemis systems as part of a sustainable architecture for NASA’s Moon to Mars exploration strategy. “Aerospace employees provide broad-ranging strategic, cost, and schedule assessments as an integral part of the CESD’s Programmatic and Strategic Integration team. Given the historical relevance of the mission, the team is honored to have worked alongside the many individuals who have contributed to its success,” says Dr. Sherrica Holloman, Senior Project Leader in the Human Exploration and Spaceflight Division.\n\nA detailed view of the various stages of Artemis I's launch and ascent profile. (Image courtesy of NASA)\n\nThe SLS and the Future of Space Exploration\n\nWith its advanced power and payload capacity, SLS has the potential to greatly expand our access to space while avoiding the inherent limitations of previous space programs. It will also usher in a new era of human space exploration.\n\n“Although we’ve been there before, going to the Moon is still difficult. The plan for Artemis is to land on the lunar South Pole, which is more challenging than returning to one of the lunar Equatorial sites of the Apollo era,” said Jon N. Cowart, Systems Director in Aerospace’s Human Exploration and Spaceflight division. “But returning to the Moon reinvigorates the capability to accomplish deeper space operations such as a crewed mission to Mars, which is a lot further away and much harder of a mission.”\n\nOnce accomplished, the Artemis I mission will pave the way for Artemis II, which will attempt a similar cislunar fly-by with a four-person crew in 2024. Scheduled for launch in 2025, the Artemis 3 mission will include a four-person cislunar fly-by followed by a two-person lunar landing, making it the first crewed lunar landing since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.\n\n“It’s essential to fly the Artemis I mission to show that the SLS rocket works,” said Randall Williams, Systems Director for Civil and Commercial Launch Projects. “As a series of missions enabled by the SLS, Artemis is aiming to incrementally advance our ability to attain greater and greater objectives in space, and we’re thrilled to be part of it.”",

Credit: NASA\n\nNASA has selected three instruments to travel to the Moon, with two planned for integration onto an LTV (Lunar Terrain Vehicle) and one for a future orbital opportunity.\n\nThe LTV is part of NASA’s efforts to explore the lunar surface as part of the Artemis campaign and is the first crew-driven vehicle to operate on the Moon in more than 50 years. Designed to hold up to two astronauts, as well as operate remotely without a crew, this surface vehicle will enable NASA to achieve more of its science and exploration goals over a wide swath of lunar terrain.\n\n“The Artemis Lunar Terrain Vehicle will transport humanity farther than ever before across the lunar frontier on an epic journey of scientific exploration and discovery,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator, Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “By combining the best of human and robotic exploration, the science instruments selected for the LTV will make discoveries that inform us about Earth’s nearest neighbor as well as benefit the health and safety of our astronauts and spacecraft on the Moon.”\n\nThe Artemis Infrared Reflectance and Emission Spectrometer (AIRES) will identify, quantify, and map lunar minerals and volatiles, which are materials that evaporate easily, like water, ammonia, or carbon dioxide. The instrument will capture spectral data overlaid on visible light images of both specific features of interest and broad panoramas to discover the distribution of minerals and volatiles across the Moon’s south polar region. The AIRES instrument team is led by Phil Christensen from Arizona State University in Tempe.\n\nThe Lunar Microwave Active-Passive Spectrometer (L-MAPS) will help define what is below the Moon’s surface and search for possible locations of ice. Containing both a spectrometer and a ground-penetrating radar, the instrument suite will measure temperature, density, and subsurface structures to more than 131 feet (40 meters) below the surface. The L-MAPS instrument team is led by Matthew Siegler from the University of Hawaii at Manoa.\n\nWhen combined, the data from the two instruments will paint a picture of the components of the lunar surface and subsurface to support human exploration and will uncover clues to the history of rocky worlds in our solar system. The instruments also will help scientists characterize the Moon’s resources, including what the Moon is made of, potential locations of ice, and how the Moon changes over time.\n\nIn addition to the instruments selected for integration onto the LTV, NASA also selected the Ultra-Compact Imaging Spectrometer for the Moon (UCIS-Moon) for a future orbital flight opportunity. The instrument will provide regional context to the discoveries made from the LTV. From above, UCIS-Moon will map the Moon’s geology and volatiles and measure how human activity affects those volatiles. The spectrometer also will help identify scientifically valuable areas for astronauts to collect lunar samples, while its wide-view images provide the overall context for where these samples will be collected. The UCIS-Moon instrument will provide the Moon’s highest spatial resolution data of surface lunar water, mineral makeup, and thermophysical properties. The UCIS-Moon instrument team is led by Abigail Fraeman from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.\n\n“Together, these three scientific instruments will make significant progress in answering key questions about what minerals and volatiles are present on and under the surface of the Moon,” said Joel Kearns, deputy associate administrator for Exploration, Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. “With these instruments riding on the LTV and in orbit, we will be able to characterize the surface not only where astronauts explore, but also across the south polar region of the Moon, offering exciting opportunities for scientific discovery and exploration for years to come.”\n\nLeading up to these instrument selections, NASA has worked with all three lunar terrain vehicle vendors – Intuitive Machines, Lunar Outpost, and Venturi Astrolab – to complete their preliminary design reviews. This review demonstrates that the initial design of each commercial lunar rover meets all of NASA’s system requirements and shows that the correct design options have been selected, interfaces have been identified, and verification methods have been described. NASA will evaluate the task order proposals received from each LTV vendor and make a selection decision on the demonstration mission by the end of 2025.\n\nThrough Artemis, NASA will address high priority science questions, focusing on those that are best accomplished by on-site human explorers on and around the Moon by using robotic surface and orbiting systems. The Artemis missions will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars.\n\nTo learn more about Artemis, visit:\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/artemis\n\n-end-\n\nKaren Fox / Molly Wasser\n\nHeadquarters, Washington\n\n202-358-1600\n\nkaren.c.fox@nasa.gov / molly.l.wasser@nasa.gov",

        "content": "After a night of uncertainty, NASA's Artemis moon rocket takes to the skies\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Raoux/AP John Raoux/AP\n\nThe predawn sky over Florida's space coast lit up early Wednesday morning as NASA's new 322-foot-tall moon rocket roared off its launch pad with a few mannequins — but no astronauts — strapped into a crew capsule.\n\nThis white, bell-shaped capsule, called Orion, has now embarked on a 25-day test flight that will take it around the moon and back. The approximately 1.2-million-mile trip will bring NASA one step closer to achieving its goal of returning humans to the lunar surface.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"For once, I might be speechless,\" launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson told her team at Kennedy Space Center, after they had sent the rocket on its way. \"You have earned your place in history. You're part of a first. It doesn't come along very often, once in a career maybe. But we are all part of something incredibly special.\"\n\nThe Orion capsule will orbit the moon, coming within about 80 miles of its surface, and its maximum distance from the Earth will be 268,553 miles — surpassing a record set by NASA's Apollo 13 mission in 1970.\n\nA step toward the 1st woman on the moon\n\nIf all goes well, the capsule will return to Earth faster and hotter than any human-rated spacecraft ever. It will splash down in the Pacific Ocean on December 11, off the coast of San Diego, Calif. And in just a couple of years, this massive rocket and the capsule could be blasting off with people on board.\n\nThe dramatic, long-awaited rocket launch, swathed in darkness, marked a major milestone for NASA, which is hoping to put the first woman and first person of color on the lunar surface by 2025.\n\nBill Nelson, the administrator of NASA, says he watched the launch from a rooftop, in the company of a number of astronauts. \"I'm telling you, we've never seen such a tail of flame. There were a bunch there that would like to be on that rocket,\" he told reporters in a post-launch press briefing.\n\nThe space agency has named its lunar program Artemis, after the twin sister of Apollo, and hopes to reclaim some of the glory of its Apollo-era moon landings. NASA's last Apollo mission to the moon happened nearly a half-century ago, in December of 1972, when the venerable Saturn V rocket thundered up from the Florida launch site.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Keegan Barber/Nasa via AP Keegan Barber/Nasa via AP\n\nIt's been a rocky road\n\nNASA has been trying to launch its Artemis rocket for months, but was stymied by technical glitches and two hurricanes.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA previous attempt to get this rocket off the ground, in September, had to be stopped because of a hydrogen leak. NASA mission managers never did figure out its root cause for sure.\n\nThis time around, when another hydrogen leak cropped up, a \"red crew\" of three workers had to go out to the launch pad, to the bottom of the dangerous, fully-fueled rocket. They tightened some bolts on a valve that apparently may have been \"visibly loose,\" according to part of an exchange captured on a hot mic. Other glitches that bedeviled the team included the loss of signal at a critical radar site that was traced to a faulty Ethernet switch.\n\nThe space agency has been working towards this launch for over a decade, since it retired its space shuttle program in 2011.\n\nBack then, Congress told NASA to build a giant new rocket, one capable of venturing to deep space, and to use technology from the old shuttles as much as possible to help support the nation's space industry.\n\nIt comes with a big price tag\n\nBut this rocket has taken years longer to build than expected, and it's also proven unexpectedly costly.\n\nNASA's inspector general, Paul Martin, has said that each of its first three flights will cost more than $4 billion — and that doesn't include billions more in development costs.\n\nHis office estimated that, through fiscal year 2025, NASA will spend $93 billion on the Artemis effort — a price tag that lots of people in the spaceflight community see as unsustainable.\n\nStill, regardless of any mixed feelings surrounding this rocket, successfully launching it may offer a sign that NASA is making progress towards once again having the moon as a real destination for humanity.\n\nThat's something many space enthusiasts have longed for ever since astronaut Eugene Cernan took the last steps on its dusty surface, saying, \"we leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind.\"",

        "content": "NASA’s huge Space Launch System moon rocket finally took off from Florida early Wednesday after a decade in development, sending an unpiloted Orion crew capsule toward lunar orbit on a 25-day test flight to lay a path for astronauts to return to the moon for the first time since 1972.\n\nThe launch from Kennedy Space Center marked the first major test flight for NASA’s Artemis program, a U.S.-led international effort to explore the moon with landers, rovers, orbiters, and a mini-space station that will serve as a staging base for lunar expeditions.\n\n“I have to say, for what we saw tonight, it’s an A-plus,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in a press conference after liftoff of the first SLS moon rocket. “It’s a test flight. It took a long time coming to get here. The last time we were on the moon was Apollo 17.”\n\nHumans have not walked on the lunar surface since Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt departed the moon on the Apollo 17 mission, 50 years ago next month. NASA canceled the final Apollo moon missions, then focused on developing a reusable spacecraft that became the space shuttle. The agency’s human spaceflight program has been centered on the International Space Station, which flies in low Earth orbit, for the last two decades.\n\nBut NASA is setting up for humanity’s return to the moon, using the powerful Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft, and an array of commercial partnerships and international agreements to supply landing craft, pressurized habitats, and elements for an outpost in lunar orbit called the Gateway.\n\nThe Artemis 1 mission that launched Wednesday is an end-to-end test of the SLS moon rocket and Orion capsule, which took off on a five-day outbound journey to the moon. Next week, the Orion spacecraft will swing into orbit around the moon for tests and checkouts, then return to Earth for splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on Dec. 11.\n\n“We still have a long ways to go,” Nelson said. “This is just the test flight, and we are stressing it and testing it in ways that we will not do to a rocket that has a human crew on it. But that’s the purpose, to make it as safe as possible, as reliable as possible, for when our astronauts crawl on-board and go back to the moon.”\n\nThe launch phase of the Artemis 1 moon mission appeared to go off without a hitch, with a thundering blastoff from Kennedy Space Center’s pad 39B at 1:47:44 a.m. EST (0647:44 GMT).\n\nThe middle-of-the-night launch followed years of delays and cost overruns. The rocket’s most recent delays were caused by technical problems discovered during practice countdowns and launch attempts earlier this year. NASA engineers detected a significant hydrogen leak during a Sept. 3 launch attempt, then the mission suffered more schedule slips due to Hurricane Ian and Hurricane Nicole.\n\nWith good weather expected Wednesday morning, NASA loaded the SLS moon rocket with cryogenic propellants and counted down to a two-hour launch window. But another hydrogen leak signature required technicians to drive back to the launch pad late Tuesday night — with the rocket nearly full of flammable fuel — and tighten bolts to allow the countdown to proceed.\n\nNASA launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson polled her team inside a firing room at Kennedy Space Center. After hearing a unanimous “go” for launch, she authorized the countdown clock to resume from a hold to tick down the final 10 minutes until liftoff.\n\nThe 322-foot-tall (98-meter) SLS moon rocket roared to life with ignition of four hydrogen-fueled RS-25 engines and two cylindrical solid rocket boosters — leftovers from the space shuttle program — mounted to each side of the voluminous orange core stage.\n\nNASA kept the shuttle-era main engines in storage for nearly a decade, fitted them with new computers, and certified the liquid-fueled powerplants to fire at higher throttle settings for the SLS moon rocket. The solid-fueled motors were lengthened — with five segments instead of the four sections on the shuttle — to provide an extra boost.\n\nThe SLS rocket generated 8.8 million pounds of thrust at full power, more than NASA’s Saturn 5 moon rocket designed in the 1960s for the Apollo program. Only the Soviet Union’s N1 moon rocket, which failed on all four of its test flights from 1969 through 1972, produced more power at liftoff.\n\nNow, for the first time since the Cold War-era U.S.-Soviet Space Race, there are two mega-rockets soon ready to enter service with NASA’s Space Launch System and SpaceX’s privately-developed Super Heavy and Starship launcher. The Super Heavy booster, designed for recovery and reuse, will generate nearly double the thrust of NASA’s SLS moon rocket with all of its 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines firing.\n\nSpaceX is preparing for the first Super Heavy/Starship test launch from Texas into a low-altitude Earth orbit in the coming months, but the company has not set a firm schedule for the flight.\n\nNASA’s SLS moon rocket is is a single-use design. That makes it significantly more expensive than SpaceX’s Starship, but the SLS design allows it to carry crew and cargo to the vicinity of the moon in a single shot. The Starship requires in-orbit refueling to reach the moon.\n\nFor Wednesday’s dazzling debut launch, Artemis 1 rocket veered east from Kennedy Space Center over the Atlantic Ocean. The two Northrop Grumman-built solid rocket boosters burned out and jettisoned about two minutes into the flight to call into the sea.\n\nThe rocket’s Boeing-made core stage continued burning its four Aerojet Rocketdyne RS-25 engines, combining to put out 2 million pounds of thrust on their own, for eight minutes. The engines chugged more than 700,000 gallons of super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants from the 27.6-foot-wide (8.4-meter) core stage tanks.\n\nThe main engines accelerated the rocket to near orbital velocity, then the core stage separated from upper part of the Space Launch System, an element produced by United Launch Alliance. The ULA-built piece of the rocket — called the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage and based on a design for the Delta 4-Heavy rocket — fired its RL10 engine two times, initially to place the Orion spacecraft into a stable low Earth orbit, then to send the capsule toward the moon.\n\nThe final engine burn of the launch sequence, called the Trans-Lunar Injection, or TLI, accelerated the vehicle to a speed relative to Earth of more than 22,500 mph (36,300 kilometers per hour) and put the Orion spacecraft on a course to reach the moon Monday, Nov. 21.\n\nMore than 500 RL10 engines have flown on Atlas, Delta, and Titan rockets since 1963, but the RL10’s trans-lunar injection burn on the Artemis 1 launch was the longest-ever firing in space by the venerable engine type.\n\nMiss this morning’s Artemis 1 launch? Here’s a replay of our live coverage of the first two minutes of the flight. Liftoff from Kennedy Space Center occurred at 1:47:44am EST (0647:44 GMT).https://t.co/KKlPNQabsH pic.twitter.com/GpjiW6z1tn — Spaceflight Now (@SpaceflightNow) November 16, 2022\n\nThe Orion capsule separated from the Space Launch System’s upper stage nearly two hours into the mission. At that point, without its no-longer-needed launch abort tower and aeroshell, the moon-bound spaceship had a mass of roughly 57,000 pounds (about 26 metric tons), around 1% of the 5.75-million pound total weight of the SLS moon rocket at liftoff.\n\nMike Sarafin, NASA’s Artemis 1 mission manager, said the moon rocket delivered the Orion spacecraft on a “dead-on” trajectory. “We’ve bought down a lot of risk today, but we’ve got a lot mission ahead of us,” Sarafin said.\n\nIf the Orion spacecraft has similar success on its round-trip flight to the moon and back, NASA aims to fly a crew of four astronauts around the moon in the second half of 2024 on the next Artemis mission.\n\nThat would be followed later this decade by a human landing near the moon’s south pole, and if NASA plans for the Artemis program come to fruition, a series of crewed and robotic lunar science missions that would open a new era in space exploration. NASA’s long-term goal is to land humans on Mars, but the moon missions will come first.\n\nArtemis is the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology. One of the Artemis program’s chief objectives is to land the first woman and first person of color on the lunar surface.\n\nThe first Artemis test flight will validate the function NASA’s Orion spacecraft as it travels more than 40,000 miles beyond the far side of the moon before blazing back through Earth’s atmosphere at nearly 25,000 mph.\n\nAbout eight hours after launch, the Orion spacecraft lit its main engine for the first time. The brief test-firing verified the engine, another leftover from the space shuttle program, was ready for a sequence of critical burns later in the Artemis 1 mission.\n\nThe Orion service module was funded by the European Space Agency and built by Airbus, with 33 engines and thrusters to control Orion’s orientation and adjust its course after launch. The service module’s main engine is a U.S. component — a refurbished space shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System engine that flew on 19 missions from 1984 through 2002.\n\nThe Orion capsule is on a course to swing about 80 miles (130 kilometers) over the lunar surface with its maneuvering engine firing Nov. 21. The outbound flyby five days after launch will guide the Orion spacecraft into a distant retrograde orbit with an average distance of more than 43,000 miles (70,000 kilometers) from the moon. At that distance from Earth, the spacecraft will be flying outside the magnetic field that shields the planet from solar and cosmic radiation.\n\nArtemis 1 also carries a range of secondary payloads, including deployable subsatellites, or CubeSats, to pursue scientific and technology demonstration missions. There are experiments and payloads inside the Orion spacecraft, too. Three mannequins strapped into the crew module’s seats will help scientists gather data and test the performance of a new astronaut spacesuit and a vest to protect the human body against radiation.\n\nOrion separation confirmed. The human-rated crew capsule is on the way to the moon after a seemingly picture-perfect launch on the maiden flight of NASA’s Space Launch System moon rocket. https://t.co/KKlPNQabsH pic.twitter.com/PVDtrsbzmK — Spaceflight Now (@SpaceflightNow) November 16, 2022\n\nMission controllers at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston are overseeing the Artemis 1 flight from launch though splashdown. They will exercise the Orion capsule’s guidance and navigation, propulsion and cooling systems, computers, software, and communications equipment. Some elements of Orion’s life support system, and its cockpit crew displays, are not on the Artemis 1 flight.\n\nAfter a half-lap around the moon, the Orion spacecraft will aim for another close flyby of the moon to steer onto a path back to Earth.\n\nThe capsule will plunge into the atmosphere Dec. 11 using a “skip re-entry” technique to bleed off speed. The re-entry velocity is about 30 percent faster than a spacecraft returning from a mission to the International Space Station. The 25-day mission duration will exceed the 21-day design life of an Orion spacecraft on standalone mission. The Orion spacecraft can spend up to six months in space when docked to a space station.\n\nDespite the abundant use of flight-proven hardware on the SLS moon rocket and Orion spacecraft, and extensive ground testing over the last decade, there were still unknowns going into the Artemis 1 mission. NASA assessed there is a 1-in-125 probability that the Orion spacecraft could be lost on the Artemis 1 mission. That’s more risk than the agency would accept on a mission with humans on-board.\n\nOn the Artemis 2 mission, the Space Launch System will initially place the Orion crew capsule into orbit around Earth, where the astronauts will perform checkouts, test out the ship’s rendezvous and docking systems, and then fire Orion’s service module engine to fly to the moon a quarter-million miles away.\n\nThe Artemis 2 mission will follow a “hybrid free return trajectory” around the moon. The Orion crew capsule won’t enter orbit around the moon, but still instead loop around the far side and return directly to Earth for splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft will arc out to a distance of 4,600 miles (7,400 kilometers) beyond the far side of the moon, farther than any humans have ever traveled into space.\n\nThe Artemis 2 mission will last around 10 days, paving the way for future landing expeditions and longer-duration flights to the Gateway, a mini-space staton NASA plans to construct in orbit around the moon.\n\nThe Artemis program’s first attempt to land a crew on the moon is penciled in for the Artemis 3 mission, scheduled for no earlier than 2025, with a derivative of the Starship vehicle SpaceX’s is developing in South Texas. The Orion spacecraft carrying astronauts from Earth with dock with the Starship lander near the moon to ferry the crew to the lunar south pole. The Starship will ascend back into space from the moon to link up with Orion to bring the astronauts back to Earth.\n\nFuture Artemis missions will utilize more commercially-developed lunar landing craft to deliver astronauts to the moon’s surface. NASA plans to debut a more powerful upper stage for the SLS moon rocket on the Artemis 4 mission, enabling assembly of the Gateway station in lunar orbit and hauling heavier cargo to the moon.\n\nBut Artemis 1 has to complete its mission before NASA can move forward with Artemis 2.\n\n“The heat shield, the stressing of the system, the delivery and performance of SLS, and recovery of the vehicle are all critical things we need to do before we can talk about going to Artemis 2,” said Jim Free, NASA’s associate administrator for exploration systems development, the NASA division that manages the Artemis program. “If we don’t get all of those, we’ll have a discussion about the risk that remains before we would put crew onto Artemis 2.”\n\nSuppliers and workers in all 50 U.S. states and 10 European countries contribute to the Artemis program, which has its roots in a revamp of NASA’s human space exploration plans at the beginning of the Obama administration. The Obama White House in 2010 canceled the behind-schedule Constellation moon program, which started development of the Orion spacecraft with a different launch system than the SLS.\n\nWhile President Obama ordered NASA to focus on developing commercial human-rated capsules to transport astronauts to and from the International Space Station — resulting in the commercial crew program with SpaceX and Boeing as contractors — Congress directed the Obama administration and NASA to accelerate work on a huge government-managed rocket program called the Space Launch System.\n\nThe Obama administration proposed NASA use the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft for a crew mission to an asteroid, proving technology for an eventual human flight to Mars. Under President Trump, the effort was re-targeted for the moon and renamed the Artemis program — the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology — with a goal of landing astronauts at the lunar south pole by the end of 2024.\n\nNASA has given up on the 2024 deadline, and the 2025 timetable for the human moon landing is in doubt. But President Biden has kept the Artemis program alive, and NASA last year selected SpaceX to build the first human-rated moon lander in more than 50 years.\n\nThe Artemis program’s ultimate objective, according to NASA, remains to test technology and practice for eventual human expeditions to Mars.\n\nBut the Artemis missions come with a hefty price tag, and the SLS moon rocket’s first flight Wednesday occurred five years later than NASA officials originally predicted.\n\nNASA’s inspector general reported each of the first four Artemis missions will cost $4.1 billion apiece. None of the SLS moon rocket is reused, despite engines and boosters originally designed for multiple launches. NASA and Lockheed Martin eventually plan to refurbish and reuse Orion crew modules.\n\nThe agency watchdog also projected NASA will have spent $93 billion on the Artemis moon program by the end of 2025, including expenses for the SLS moon rocket, Orion spacecraft, ground systems, a human-rated moon lander, and the Gateway station.\n\nSo far, NASA has spent more than $48 billion to develop the Space Launch System, Orion spacecraft, and prepare ground systems at the Kennedy Space Center for the new-generation moon program.\n\nNASA committed $14.2 billion to develop the Orion spacecraft from 2012 through the end of the last fiscal year Sept. 30, plus an additional $6.3 billion committed to the program in the prior decade under the Constellation program.\n\nNASA budgeted $22.4 billion for the SLS program from 2012 through the end of fiscal year 2022. Another $5.4 billion in the same period went toward readying Kennedy Space Center’s ground infrastructure for SLS and Orion missions.\n\nEmail the author.\n\nFollow Stephen Clark on Twitter: @StephenClark1.",

On Wednesday morning just before 2 AM, NASA finally launched Artemis 1, an unmanned mission that will send a rocket around the Moon, from its Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Though unmanned, the spacecraft carried a module that is designed to carry humans. The rocket on which the module traveled is known as Orion, and is NASA’s flagship rocket for future Moon missions.\n\nOriginally slated for lift-off on August 29, four different delays pushed the mission back to November 16th. The repeated delays were a result of extreme caution on behalf of NASA, given the mission’s expense: NASA estimates it will spend $95 billion on the Artemis project up till 2025, with each launch, including this one, costing about $4.1 billion. The delays were partially due to the pure hydrogen fuel tanks, which proved to be finicky.\n\nThankfully, the Artemis 1 launch went off without a hitch. Now, the spacecraft will undergo a full test of its capabilities and instruments over the course of the next three weeks before it returns to Earth.\n\n“What an incredible sight to see NASA’s Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft launch together for the first time. This uncrewed flight test will push Orion to the limits in the rigors of deep space, helping us prepare for human exploration on the Moon and, ultimately, Mars,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement.\n\nThis mission is intended to inaugurate a new era of exploration of the Moon, which has not been visited by humans since 1972. If and when a manned mission returns, it will mark a new era for humanity. For these reasons, the Artemis missions are considered a big deal, hence why so many people were closely following its postponements.\n\nThough there aren’t any astronauts onboard, there’s still a lot we’ll be able to study about Earth’s closest neighbor. So what will we hope to learn?\n\nWhat are Artemis and Orion and where are they going?\n\nArtemis is the name of the mission, after the Greek lunar deity, who was the “goddess of the hunt.” Orion is the name of the semi-reusable spacecraft, named for the constellation which depicts another mythical Greek hunter.\n\nAccording to NASA, Orion will loop once around the Earth, flinging it approximately 40,000 miles beyond the Moon, where it will zip around it on November 21. There, it will drop off a few toaster-sized satellites called CubeSats (more on them in a bit) and return to Earth over the course of 25.5 days, splashing back down to earth on December 11.\n\nWhile this mission may seem similar to Apollo, the execution is quite different, and it marks a lot of firsts — including the first use of the blandly named Space Launch System, which is the most powerful rocket in the world and NASA’s largest since the Saturn V rockets of the Apollo mission era. The Apollo missions were also much shorter, typically around 8 days in space.\n\nWhat took so long to get the rocket off the ground?\n\nTwo technical issues — a problem with one of the engines on August 29th and a hydrogen leak on September 3 — made launching Artemis 1 too dangerous. But weather was a major issue, too. First, Tropical Storm Ian scrapped a September 24 launch while Hurricane Nicole delayed the launch on November 14.\n\nBut these delays are only the most recent. In truth, the Orion program has been suffering setbacks, including from tornadoes and design flaws, since 2010, when President Obama signed the NASA Authorization Act, kickstarting the program.\n\nAs history has shown, little errors can have big consequences, so it’s probably a good thing NASA waited until the right moment. Rushed engineering of unmanned Vanguard rockets designed during the beginning of the Space Race led to dismal consequences: from 1957 to 1959, only 3 of 11 Vanguard rockets successfully reached orbit.\n\nNow, the Artemis missions will lay the foundation for other off-world exploration, including potential Mars expeditions.\n\nWant more health and science stories in your inbox?

CubeSats are lightweight, blocky satellites that have revolutionized interstellar communication because you can stuff a lot of them on a single rocket. In fact, Orion has already dropped a few that have since begun tweeting.\n\nSome of them are more exciting than others. OMOTENASHI, for example, will crash itself into the Moon’s surface using a laser-ignited rocket. Japan’s JAXA, their equivalent to NASA, designed the smallest lunar lander in history to deploy an airbag, allowing OMOTENASHI (a Japanese word which means “hospitality”) to land safely. It will then measure radiation levels which are “essential to support radiation risk assessments for astronauts and establish a benchmark for space radiation models for human space activities on the Moon,” a JAXA report explains.\n\nBioSentinel is another peculiar experiment, containing a bioengineered strain of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) typically used in baking and brewing beer. The fungus are embedded into microfluidic cards that can measure their growth and “help calibrate the biological effects of radiation in deep space,” NASA says. Space agencies will need to design ways of dealing with the vast level of radiation in space, which will be a huge issue for any humans that visit the moon. Speaking of which…\n\nWhat’s next for Moon missions?\n\nArtemis 1 is just the beginning. Artemis 2, due to launch in May 2024, will carry humans — but they will not land, merely orbit the moon, much like they Apollo 8 and Apollo 10 missions. If all goes well with Artemis 1 and 2, the Artemis 3 mission could launch as early as 2025. It is intended to put people on the moon for the first time since 1972, the Apollo 17 mission.\n\nThe Artemis 3 mission won’t merely be the first time in a while since someone has put bootprints on Moon dust. NASA states they intend to “land the first woman and the first person of color on the surface of the Moon,” with this mission.",

        "content": "Fifty-six years after Neil Armstrong’s historic first step on the Moon, Nasa is leading the drive to send astronauts to the lunar surface once more, though it is feared at the expense of its own scientific programmes.\n\nThe agency is marking Moon Day on July 20, the anniversary of the famous Apollo 11 landing, as it navigates a period of transition without a Senate-confirmed administrator.\n\nWhile US President Donald Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' secures funding for Artemis, Nasa’s flagship Moon exploration programme, the White House spending plan slashes the budget for the agency’s Earth science, astrophysics and planetary research divisions by nearly half.\n\nScientists and space policy experts told The National that the US is sacrificing some of its most ambitious scientific projects to keep the lunar return on track.\n\nDr Gordon Osinski, an Earth sciences professor at the Western University in Ontario, Canada, and a geology team member for Artemis III, said he is concerned about the long-term effect these cuts could have.\n\n“While Artemis II appears to be on schedule for a spring 2026 launch, I am concerned about US budget cuts, the big exodus of senior Nasa employees and what this means for returning humans to the surface of the Moon in the Artemis III mission,” he said.\n\nSome Nasa employees are set to hold a protest on Moon Day in Washington DC in a bid to save the agency's science divisions.\n\n\"We're fighting for science, engineering and exploration,\" the protest website reads. \"Tell Congress to push back on the 2025 Presidential Budget Request that cuts Nasa science by 47 per cent, Stem education by 100 per cent, and Nasa's full budget by 25 per cent.\"\n\nArtemis boost but science takes hit\n\nThe Trump administration has made crewed exploration a centrepiece of its space agenda.\n\nThe 'Big Beautiful Bill', signed into law on July 4, features billions of dollars in additional funding for the Space Launch System, Orion capsule and Lunar Gateway projects.\n\nBut the White House's proposed budget cuts would reshape programmes in favour of crewed exploration, slashing funding for climate monitoring satellites, planetary missions such as the Mars Sample Return and major space telescopes in development.\n\nDr Dimitra Atri, scientist at NYUAD, said current space policy lacks the clarity and consistency that helped propel the Apollo missions.\n\n“The public’s relationship with space exploration has changed dramatically since Apollo’s collective wonder in 1969,” he said.\n\n“Today’s achievements, while technically sophisticated, struggle to capture that same imagination, especially when delays and setbacks dominate headlines.\n\n“Apollo went from [US president John F] Kennedy’s 1961 announcement to lunar landing in eight years, while Artemis has spent over a decade working to return astronauts to lunar orbit, something we accomplished 50 years ago with far less capabilities.”\n\nNasa has been a global leader in explorative space science for decades, responsible for some of the most ground-breaking missions in history.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope, for example, revolutionised astronomy by capturing deep-space images that reshaped our understanding of the universe.\n\nNasa's fleet of Mars rovers, including Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity and Perseverance, uncovered evidence of past water activity and potential habitability on the Red Planet.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, is offering unprecedented views of the early universe and distant exoplanets.\n\nOn Earth, the Terra and Aqua satellites have played a key role in monitoring climate change.\n\nRising global competition\n\nWhile Nasa deals with the reshaping of its programmes, other countries are making steady progress with their Moon plans and scientific space missions.\n\nChina completed the first lunar far side sample return with its Chang’e-6 mission and is planning a crewed Moon landing before 2030.\n\nFifty-four countries are part of the US-led Artemis Accords, an international agreement on peaceful and transparent lunar exploration.\n\nDr Osinski said Moon Day should remind the world of the value of international co-operation and science-driven exploration.\n\n“Moon Day is an excellent way to focus the world’s attention on the past, present and future of lunar exploration,” he said.\n\n“While its date is based on the first US landing on the surface of the Moon, it has grown to represent much more than this and to be a global celebration.\n\n“International collaboration is key to space exploration and so Moon Day can provide some sorely needed inspiration and an example of the good that can come about when countries work with each other, not against.”\n\nShift to commercial space\n\nNasa’s increasing reliance on commercial partners is also shaping how it now approaches exploration.\n\nSpaceX’s Starship is central to Artemis III’s landing plan and Axiom Space is developing the new generation of lunar spacesuits.\n\nDave Barnhart, chief executive of California space infrastructure company Arkisys, said the rise of commercial space is a natural evolution, one that can benefit science in the long run.\n\n“Nasa was the pioneer to create the environment for commercial cargo to the ISS, which is now leading to development of commercial space stations,” he said.\n\n“Likewise, they contracted several companies to lead new vehicle development and test flights to the Moon, which has encouraged true investment.”\n\nHe said that even if Nasa’s scientific leadership weakens in the short term, global and private-sector collaboration could generate even greater returns.\n\n“We are going to gain far more than just what one government organisation could apply to the problems,” he said.\n\nSHADOWS%20AND%20LIGHT%3A%20THE%20EXTRAORDINARY%20LIFE%20OF%20JAMES%20MCBEY

        "content": "NASA’s Artemis I mission is finally on its way to the Moon, a feat that marks the debut of the world’s most powerful rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), and secures a major milestone in the agency’s quest to return humans to the lunar surface in the coming years.\n\nThe long-awaited mission is not carrying any astronauts on its journey to orbit the Moon, though it will test out the new Orion spacecraft that NASA plans to use for crewed trips beyond Earth, including to Mars, in the future.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nSLS, which produces even more thrust than the Saturn V rocket that carried the Apollo astronauts to the Moon a half-century ago, blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 1:47 am Eastern Time for its very first flight on Wednesday.\n\nPlay video\n\nThe rocket successfully delivered the Orion spacecraft into orbit, kicking off a journey around the Moon and back that will last about 25 days. If all goes to plan, Orion will return to Earth after its lunar test flight and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on December 11.\n\n“What an incredible sight to see NASA’s Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft launch together for the first time,” said NASA administrator Bill Nelson in a statement. “This uncrewed flight test will push Orion to the limits in the rigors of deep space, helping us prepare for human exploration on the Moon and, ultimately, Mars.”\n\nThis launch was no doubt met with a collective sigh of relief from the Artemis team, as the mission has experienced a host of setbacks and delays. SLS was originally scheduled to embark on its first flight back in August, but a sensor malfunction and a hydrogen leak scuttled that plan.\n\nThe mission was pushed back two more times by Hurricane Ian in September and Hurricane Nicole last week. Though Nicole damaged Orion slightly, mission leads decided it was safe to proceed with Wednesday’s launch, setting Artemis I on course to orbit the Moon.\n\nOrion will reach lunar orbit in the coming days and pass within just 60 miles of the Moon’s surface next Monday, November 21. It will then swing out to an altitude of 40,000 miles before performing another close pass on December 5, which will give it the gravitational assist to return to Earth.\n\nThe launch marks the official beginning of the Artemis Program, a series of missions spearheaded by NASA that aims to send several crews on the lunar surface. Among the goals of the program is to land the first woman and person of color on the Moon, and to establish a laboratory called the Lunar Gateway in lunar orbit.\n\n“The Space Launch System rocket delivered the power and performance to send Orion on its way to the Moon,” said Mike Sarafin, Artemis I mission manager, in a statement. “With the accomplishment of the first major milestone of the mission, Orion will now embark on the next phase to test its systems and prepare for future missions with astronauts.”",

        "content": "Humans have always been drawn to explore, discover, and learn as much as we can about the world—and worlds—around us. This isn’t always easy, but it’s in our nature.\n\nFollowing two Artemis test missions, Artemis III, currently planned for 2027, will mark humanity’s first return to the lunar surface in more than 50 years. NASA will make history by sending the first humans to explore the region near the lunar South Pole.\n\nOn the way\n\nNASA’s Space Launch System rocket carrying the Orion spacecraft launches on the Artemis I flight test, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2022, from Launch Complex 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. NASA’s Artemis I mission is the first integrated flight test of the agency’s deep space exploration systems: the Orion spacecraft, Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, and ground systems. SLS and Orion launched at 1:47 a.m. EST, from Launch Pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center. Photo Credit: (NASA/Joel Kowsky)\n\nNASA’s Orion spacecraft will be the crew’s ride to and from Earth and into and out of lunar orbit. Orion is the only spacecraft capable of returning crews to Earth at lunar reentry velocities. On the successful Artemis I mission, Orion’s uniquely designed heat shield was recently tested under these extreme reentry conditions. Four astronauts will depart from Launch Pad 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop SLS (Space Launch System, the only rocket powerful enough to send Orion, its crew, and their supplies to the Moon in a single launch. The crew will be selected from among the most diverse astronaut corps in history, each equipped with unique skills and intensively trained.\n\nFirst the crew will launch to Earth orbit where they will perform systems checks and solar panel adjustments on Orion. Then, a powerful push from SLS’s interim cryogenic propulsion stage will help Orion perform a translunar injection maneuver, setting its course to the Moon.\n\nFor several days, the crew will travel toward the Moon and perform corrective engine burns to intercept the Moon’s gravitational field. At the right time and location, Orion will perform a series of two engine burns to place the spacecraft in a lunar Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO). From hundreds of potential orbits, NASA selected NRHO to achieve long-term Artemis goals. NRHO will provide near-constant communications with Earth and access to sites all over the Moon. Because it is gravitationally balanced between Earth and the Moon, this orbit will maximize fuel efficiency. On future missions, NASA and its partners will assemble the Gateway lunar space station in NRHO to serve as a hub for Artemis missions.\n\nNASA has selected SpaceX to provide the human landing system that will transport Artemis III astronauts from Orion in lunar orbit to the surface of the Moon and back again. SpaceX plans to use a unique concept of operations to increase the overall efficiency of their lander. After a series of tests, SpaceX will fly at least one uncrewed demo mission that lands Starship on the lunar surface. When Starship has met all of NASA’s requirements and high standards for crew safety, it will be ready for its first Artemis mission.\n\nBefore the crew launch, SpaceX will launch a storage depot to Earth orbit. A series of reusable tankers will carry propellant to the storage depot to fuel the human landing system. The uncrewed Starship human landing system will then launch to Earth orbit and rendezvous with the storage depot to fill its tanks before executing a translunar injection engine burn and traveling approximately six days to NRHO where it will await the Artemis III crew.\n\nWhen both spacecraft have arrived in NRHO, Orion will dock with the Starship human landing system in preparation for the first lunar surface expedition of the 21st century. Once the crew and their supplies are ready, two astronauts will board Starship and two will remain in Orion. Orion will undock and back away from Starship to remain in NRHO for roughly one orbit around the Moon, lasting about 6.5 days. This will match the length of the surface expedition, so as Orion completes its orbit, the two person surface crew will finish their work on the surface in time to launch back up to meet the spacecraft.\n\nNASA has its sights set on locations around the South Pole for the Artemis era of human lunar exploration. Extreme, contrasting conditions make it a challenging location for Earthlings to land, live, and work, but the region’s unique characteristics hold promise for unprecedented deep space scientific discoveries. Using advanced technology including autonomous systems, the crew inside of Starship will land at a carefully selected site within a 100-meter radius.\n\nOn the Moon\n\nArtist’s concept of SpaceX Starship human landing system. SpaceX\n\nAfter touchdown, the surface crew’s first task will be to ensure all systems are ready for their lunar surface stay. Then they will rest, eat, and recharge for the first full day of the expedition.\n\nDuring their time on the Moon, the astronauts will do scientific work inside Starship and conduct a series of moonwalks, exiting Starship to explore the surface. The astronauts will don advanced spacesuits, exit through an airlock, and descend on Starship’s elevator. NASA has selected Axiom Space to provide the Artemis III surface suits and spacewalk systems. These suits will give the astronauts increased range of motion and flexibility to explore more of the landscape than on previous lunar missions.\n\nDuring their moonwalks, the astronauts will take pictures and video, survey geology, retrieve samples, and collect other data to meet specific scientific objectives. The view from the lunar South Pole region will look very different from the photos taken on Apollo missions in the Moon’s equatorial region. The Sun will hover just above the horizon, casting long, dark shadows across the terrain, which the crew will explore using headlamps and navigational tools. The information and materials collected by Artemis III astronauts will increase our understanding of the mysterious South Pole region, the Moon, and our solar system.\n\nMission control teams on the ground will be in contact with the crew as they relay what they see, hear, and feel. Through mission coverage and the ability to send high quality images and video to the ground with advanced communication technology, they will be sharing a unique new human experience with the world.\n\nOn the journey home\n\nThe Orion spacecraft photo of itself with the moon in the distance. NASA\n\nWhen their surface expedition is complete, the two astronauts will lift off the surface of the Moon and head back to NRHO in Starship to reunite with their crewmates in Orion. After docking, the crew will spend up to five days in orbit, transferring samples between the vehicles and preparing for the journey back to Earth.\n\nWhen they reach the optimal NRHO departure point, with all four astronauts back in Orion, they will undock and ignite Orion’s engines, slinging the spacecraft past the Moon, and allowing it to coast toward Earth. The crew will travel about 24,855 miles (about 40,000 kilometers) per hour during reentry into Earth’s atmosphere. Assisted by 11 parachutes, the spacecraft will splash down in the Pacific Ocean where it and the crew will be retrieved with support from the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy.\n\nArtemis III will be one of the most complex undertakings of engineering and human ingenuity in the history of deep space exploration to date. The astronauts’ observations, samples, and data collected will expand our understanding of our solar system and home planet, while inspiring the next generation.\n\nThis mission will usher in a future in which humans consistently access the Moon, and human planetary exploration missions are within reach. Each Artemis mission will increase our knowledge, refine our operations, and prove our technology as we prepare for the first human mission to Mars.\n\nArtemis III Mission Map\n\nArtemis III will be humanity’s return to the lunar surface and NASA will make history by sending the first humans to the lunar South Pole region.

        "content": "Legacy aerospace giants scored a win Tuesday when the U.S. Senate passed President Trump’s budget reconciliation bill that earmarks billions more for NASA’s flagship Artemis program.\n\nThe $10 billion addition to the Artemis architecture, which includes funding for additional Space Launch System rockets and an orbiting station around the moon called Gateway, is a rebuke to critics who wished to see alternative technologies used instead. Among those critics are SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, who Musk proposed as the next NASA administrator.\n\nThere’s no sign the souring relations between Musk and Trump are recovering. If Trump signs the bill, the fallout, which began after the president’s abrupt revocation of Isaacman’s nomination, will likely continue — if not escalate.\n\nMusk in particular has taken aim at the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket on the grounds that it is fully expendable. Unlike SpaceX’s family of rockets, which are all designed to be reusable, SLS is one-time use only. As Musk put it back in 2020, that means “a billion dollar rocket is blown up” every time it is launched. Even that may have been an understatement; more recent figures from NASA’s watchdog put recurring production costs closer to $2.5 billion each.\n\nA total of around $24 billion has been poured into SLS production to date, funds that have primarily gone to a consortium of aerospace primes, including Boeing, L3Harris’ Aerojet Rocketdyne, and Northrop Grumman, which leads construction of the major rocket components.\n\nDuring his recent confirmation hearings with the Senate, Isaacman questioned the massive sums. He affirmed using SLS for the next two Artemis missions, but ultimately said he didn’t think the rocket was “the long‑term way to get to and from the moon and to Mars with great frequency.”\n\nCongress — and Trump, if he decides to sign the bill into law — have decided to press ahead. Around $4.1 billion of the $10 billion total added to the document will go toward additional SLS rockets for Artemis missions 4 and 5. Meanwhile, around $2.6 billion will go toward completion of the Gateway station.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nNotably, the president’s fiscal year budget request for NASA submitted in May proposed to “phase out the Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft after the Artemis III mission is complete.” This new funding flies in the face of that proposal, which was submitted before Musk and Trump’s public fallout in June.\n\nThe new funding includes $700 million for a new Mars Telecommunications Orbiter, $1.25 billion for additional operation of the International Space Station, and $325 million to SpaceX for the development of a spacecraft to de-orbit the ISS at the end of the decade. (The total award for that de-orbit spacecraft is $843 million.)",

        "content": "KENNEDY SPACE CENTER — Citing the proposed budget cuts by the Trump administration, NASA announced on Friday that after the Artemis III mission — where Americans will return to the moon — the rocket and capsule will be retired.\n\nWhat You Need To Know The most recent federal budget proposes the end of the Space Launch System rocket and Orion capsule after the Artemis III moon-landing mission\n\n\n\n\n\nScientific programs and research will also be cut\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration wants to focus on moon and Mars missions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe also budget states that efforts will be made to \"streamline\" NASA’s workforce; Congress must vote to approve the budget\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an email obtained by Spectrum News, Acting Administrator Janet Petro stated to NASA employees that, “This budget will bring real change\"\n\nGet more space coverage here ▶\n\n\n\n🔻Scroll down to review the budget🔻\n\nThe Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and the Orion capsule will be retired because they are “grossly expensive and delayed,” according to President Donald Trump’s Fiscal Year 2026 Discretionary Funding Request.\n\nThe proposed budget states that commercial space companies will be cheaper for future missions:\n\n“The Budget phases out the grossly expensive and delayed Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule after three flights. SLS alone costs $4 billion per launch and is 140 percent over budget. The Budget funds a program to replace SLS and Orion flights to the Moon with more cost-effective commercial systems that would support more ambitious subsequent lunar missions.\"\n\nIf everything goes as planned, the Artemis III mission will see the SLS rocket launch the crewed Orion capsule to the moon. As Orion orbits the moon, it will dock with SpaceX’s Starship. Two of the four astronauts on the Orion will go to Starship, where it will take them to the moon’s surface.\n\nOnce the mission on the moon is finished, Starship will take off and dock with Orion again and the two astronauts will re-board the capsule, undock and head back to Earth.\n\nThe Starship will remain in space.\n\nHowever, NASA has stated that some of the delays to the Artemis mission are due to Starship, which has not had a fully successful test launch.\n\nIn addition, the budget proposes the termination of the small lunar space station called Gateway that would be part of the Artemis missions and allow international astronauts to make scientific explorations.\n\nThe budget also wants NASA to refocus its efforts in beating China to the moon and sending the first human to the planet Mars.\n\nChina plans to land its astronauts on the moon by 2030. The Artemis III mission is expected to send Americans to Earth’s lunar sister in 2027.\n\nThe budget will be cutting numerous programs, including the Mars Sample Return mission, a joint NASA and European Space Agency campaign to send Martian soil and rock samples collected by the rovers back to Earth.\n\nThe budget justifies this decision by stating if American astronauts are on Mars, they can collect the samples themselves and return them to Earth.\n\nA number of cuts and elimination of NASA programs, including scientific ones, are mentioned in the proposal, including the Office of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Engagement, which is called “woke”.\n\n“NASA will inspire the next generation of explorers through exciting, ambitious space missions, not through subsidizing woke STEM programming and research that prioritizes some groups of students over others and have had minimal impact on the aerospace workforce,” stated the budget.\n\nThe also budget states that efforts will be made to \"streamline\" NASA’s workforce.\n\n“To achieve these objectives, the Budget would streamline the NASA workforce, information technology services, NASA Center operations, facility maintenance, and construction and environmental compliance activities,” it stated.\n\nIn an email obtained by Spectrum News, Acting Administrator Janet Petro stated to NASA employees that, “This budget will bring real change — not just to programs, but to people. Some activities will wind down, and we owe it to the American taxpayer to face these choices with clarity and courage as we continue our mission. Extending the status quo is not an option.”\n\nCongress must vote to approve the budget.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing in April, NASA administrator nominee Jared Isaacman was asked about possible budget cuts to the U.S. space agency.\n\n“Senator, I think right now, NASA has a pretty extraordinary budget. I believe that it is close to every federal law enforcement agency combined times two,\" he said. \"With that budget in those resources available, I do believe we can do the near impossible. I believe we can have multiple flagship at once, which means we can have multiple space exploration at once in trying to solve the space economy.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation confirmed that the 42-year-old tech entrepreneur and commercial astronaut as the new administrator for America’s space agency.\n\nThe full U.S. Senate needs to vote to make it official.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s Fiscal Year 2026 Discretionary Funding Request",

        "content": "A Chinese spacecraft ferrying rocks drilled from the moon’s surface is on course to land back on Earth Wednesday and deliver the first fresh lunar samples to scientists since the 1970s.\n\nThe Chang’e 5 mission’s return spacecraft is in the home stretch of a 23-day mission that successfully launched on China’s most powerful rocket Nov. 23, landed on the moon Dec. 1, collected samples, then took off again Dec. 3 to accomplish the first automated docking between two robotic spacecraft around another planetary body.\n\nChang’e 5’s ascender vehicle linked up with the mission’s return spacecraft Dec. 5, then transferred the capsule containing the moon rocks to the return craft before jettisoning and intentionally crashing into the moon Dec. 7.\n\nWith those steps completed, all that’s left is to bring the lunar samples back to Earth.\n\nChang’e 5’s return spacecraft fired thrusters to raise its orbit around the moon on Friday, then performed a final departure maneuver at 8:51 p.m. EST Saturday (0151 GMT Sunday) to head for Earth, according to the China National Space Administration. The 22-minute maneuver with four small thrusters provided the impulse necessary for the Chang’e 5 return craft to break free of the moon’s gravity.\n\nThe probe completed a course correction burn Monday and continued cruising toward Earth Tuesday, aiming for a landing in China’s Inner Mongolia region Wednesday.\n\nChinese officials have not disclosed the exact landing time, but public notices directing pilots to steer clear of the mission’s recovery zone are active from 12:32 p.m. until 1:07 p.m. EST (1732-1807 GMT) — in the middle of the night in the remote landing area.\n\nChang’e 5’s return spacecraft will release the capsule carrying the moon rocks before entering the atmosphere.\n\nThe re-entry capsule will bounce off the atmosphere in a “skip re-entry” to slow the craft down before landing, diminishing its initial entry velocity from 25,000 mph, or 40,000 kilometers per hour, significantly faster than a re-entry from low Earth orbit. The skip re-entry will help reduce heat the landing capsule will encounter during descent, Chinese officials said, before the craft deploys a parachute for landing.\n\nChinese recovery crews in Inner Mongolia are preparing for the arrival of the lunar samples, Chinese state media reported Tuesday.\n\nThe Chang’e 5 sample return mission, if successful, will mark the first round-trip flight to the moon in 44 years. It is the first tmie lunar material has been returned to Earth since 1976, when the Soviet Union’s robotic Luna 24 mission brought back around 170 grams, or 6 ounces, of specimens from the lunar surface.\n\nNine missions have returned moon samples to Earth, including NASA’s six Apollo missions with astronauts, and three robotic Luna spacecraft launched by the Soviet Union. NASA’s Apollo missions brought back 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of rocks from the moon.\n\nChinese scientists will take the lunar material to a climate-controlled facility to begin analyses on the rocks. Researchers hope to learn about the moon’s history and evolution.\n\nThe Chang’e 5 mission’s goal was to collect more than 4 pounds, or 2 kilograms, of rocks for return to Earth. Chinese officials have not released an estimate of how much material the spacecraft gathered on the moon.\n\nThe Chang’e lunar program is named for a moon goddess in Chinese folklore.\n\nThe sample return mission follows earlier feats in China’s lunar exploration program. Most recently, the Chang’e 4 mission performed the first successful soft landing on the far side of the moon in January 2019. Chang’e 4 uses a dedicated data relay satellite flying in deep space to bounce commands and scientific data between ground teams and the spacecraft on the lunar surface.\n\nChina’s next lunar mission, Chang’e 6, is similar to Chang’e 5. It might attempt a sample return mission to retrieve lunar rocks from a location near the moon’s south pole around 2023.\n\nEmail the author.\n\nFollow Stephen Clark on Twitter: @StephenClark1.",

        "content": "On April 24, observed as Space Day in China, the Chinese authorities announced that seven institutions from six countries, including two NASA-funded U.S. universities, would be given access to samples from the moon collected by the Chang'e-5 mission.\n\nThis is being widely praised by the science community, who say that China's sharing of its lunar samples not only reflects its openness on space exploration but also highlights the importance and value of global collaboration in scientific research.\n\nWith its open competitive process for providing access to the samples, \"China is setting a very positive example for scientific cooperation,\" Frédéric Moynier, a cosmochemist at the Paris Institute of Planetary Physics, who was given a portion of the lunar samples, told Science magazine.\n\nThe decision demonstrates China's commitment to international cooperation in space once again. China's lunar missions have already carried international payloads to conduct scientific research. For example, the Chang'e-6 robotic probe carried four such payloads in 2024. They included a Pakistani CubeSat satellite that was successfully sent into the lunar orbit, capturing images of the moon and sun and collecting magnetic field data.\n\nThe Chang'e-7 mission, scheduled for launch next year, will have six international payloads, while the Chang'e-8 mission, slated for 2028, will include 10 scientific payloads and offer 200 kg of payload capacity for interested countries.\n\nThe pragmatic actions reflect China's increasingly proactive and open approach to international space exchange and cooperation. As Science magazine commented, \"Sharing the samples takes China's embrace of international cooperation in space science to a new level.\"\n\nHow has China been able to share opportunities with the international community? \"This is because of the increase in our nation's overall strength and consequent rise in self-confidence,\" Wu Weiren, chief designer of China's lunar exploration program, told Reuters.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing the lunar samples will enhance the understanding of the moon's formation and evolution, while forging stronger international scientific partnerships by bringing together diverse perspectives and technologies.\n\nIt is great to see this important milestone in the scientific cooperation between Europe and China, said Dr James Carpenter, head of the European Space Agency's Lunar Science Office. The Chang'e-5 lunar samples provide a unique window into the history of the solar system, Carpenter added. Chinese researchers, collaborating with foreign researchers, have already analyzed the moon samples collected by Chang'e-5 and produced groundbreaking findings.\n\nNow with increased international collaboration, it is expected that the future discoveries will help fill the gaps in human understanding of the moon's geology.\n\nFor example, Professor Mahesh Anand and his team at the Open University in the UK plan to evaluate the giant-impact origin of the moon. Timothy Glotch, a planetary scientist at Stony Brook University in the U.S., will focus on collecting infrared spectra and studying space weathering. Undoubtedly, their research will unveil more mysteries of the moon.\n\nIn this context, it is worth noting that due to the Wolf Amendment, which prevents U.S. government funds from being used in direct and bilateral cooperation with the Chinese government, Professor Glotch and his team will be doing their research using non-NASA funding, with his institution providing the necessary financial support.\n\nChina remains committed to an open space diplomacy policy. The lunar samples are a shared treasure for all humanity. China expects them to help scientists around the world make more pathbreaking discoveries, expand human knowledge, and benefit entire humanity.",

        "content": "A capsule containing moon rocks landed in a remote, snow-covered corner of China Wednesday, bringing home the first samples from the lunar surface in 44 years and completing the Chinese space program’s most challenging robotic mission to date.\n\nThe return module appeared to have landed intact in China’s Inner Mongolia region, based on images broadcast on Chinese state television and released by the China National Space Administration.\n\nChinese officials confirmed the roughly 660-pound (300-kilogram) capsule landed at 12:59 p.m. EST (1759 GMT) Wednesday, or 1:59 a.m. Thursday in Beijing.\n\nRecovery crews dispatched to the remote landing zone converged on the capsule in helicopters and off-road vehicles, traveling across the snow-covered plains of Inner Mongolia in the middle of the night. Ground teams reached the Chang’e 5 return module within minutes to begin operations to secure the capsule, and planted a Chinese flag in the frozen soil next the spacecraft.\n\nCrews plan to transport the module to Beijing, where scientists will open the sample carrier and begin analyzing the moon rocks.\n\n“Congratulations to China on today’s return of lunar samples to Earth!” tweeted Thomas Zurbuchen, head of NASA’s science mission directorate. “The international science community celebrates your successful Chang’e 5 mission. These samples will help reveal secrets of our Earth-moon system and gain new insights about the history of our solar system.”\n\nThe Chang’e 5 mission’s return to Earth capped a 23-day mission that successfully launched on China’s most powerful rocket Nov. 23, landed on the moon Dec. 1, collected samples, then took off again Dec. 3 to accomplish the first automated docking between two robotic spacecraft around another planetary body.\n\nChang’e 5’s ascender vehicle linked up with the mission’s return spacecraft Dec. 5, then transferred the capsule containing the moon rocks to the return craft before jettisoning and intentionally crashing into the moon Dec. 7.\n\nWith those steps completed, all that was left was to bring the lunar samples back to Earth.\n\nChang’e 5’s return spacecraft fired thrusters to raise its orbit around the moon on Friday, then performed a final departure maneuver Saturday (U.S. time) to head for Earth, according to the China National Space Administration. The 22-minute maneuver with four small thrusters provided the impulse necessary for the Chang’e 5 return craft to break free of the moon’s gravity.\n\nThe probe completed a course correction burn Monday and continued cruising toward Earth Tuesday, aiming for a landing in China’s Inner Mongolia region Wednesday.\n\nChinese officials did not disclose the exact landing time in advance, but public notices directing pilots to steer clear of the mission’s recovery zone were active during the expected time of the capsule’s re-entry. Chinese state media also did not broadcast the mission’s return to Earth live, but began video coverage after the capsule’s landing.\n\nChang’e 5’s return spacecraft released the re-entry capsule more than 3,000 miles (about 5,000 kilometers) over the South Atlantic Ocean, then performed an evasive maneuver, presumably to avoid entering the atmosphere and head back into space.\n\nThe capsule plunged into the atmosphere at 1733 GMT (12:33 p.m. EST), China’s space agency said.\n\nThe re-entry capsule was designed to bounce off the atmosphere in a “skip re-entry” to slow the craft down before landing, diminishing its initial entry velocity from 25,000 mph, or 40,000 kilometers per hour, significantly faster than a re-entry from low Earth orbit. The skip re-entry also helped reduce heat the landing capsule will encounter during descent, Chinese officials said, before the craft deployed a parachute for landing.\n\nNine missions have returned moon samples to Earth, including NASA’s six Apollo missions with astronauts, and three robotic Luna spacecraft launched by the Soviet Union. NASA’s Apollo missions brought back 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of rocks from the moon.\n\nThe Soviet Union’s Luna 24 mission was the last mission to return rocks from the moon in 1976.\n\nChang’e 5 is the first Chinese sample return mission, following successful landings of Chinese spacecraft on the moon in 2013 and 2019. The landing in 2019, on the Chang’e 5 mission, was the first soft touchdown of a spacecraft on the far side of the moon.\n\nChang’e 5 landed on the near side of the moon in the Oceanus Procellarum, or Ocean of Storms, region, east of a volcanic plateau named Mons Rümker.\n\nThere is evidence that rocks in Chang’e 5’s landing zone are much younger than those returned by the Apollo astronauts. Those specimens are some 3.5 billion years old, created during a period of active volcanism in the first billion years of the moon’s existence.\n\nLava plains to the east of Mons Rümker appear to be less battered by asteroid impacts, suggesting rocks there could be less than 2 billion years old. But models of the moon’s evolution suggest its internal heating should have diminished by that time, rendering volcanoes extinct, Neal said.\n\n“It will be exciting to look at the age of these samples coming back and also the actual compositions of them,” said Clive Neal, a planetary scientist at the University of Notre Dame, in an interview with Spaceflight Now before Chang’e 5’s launch.\n\nChinese officials have said they plan to give international scientists access to the Chang’e 5 samples. The mission was designed to gather up to 4.4 pounds, or 2 kilograms, of lunar material using a subsurface drill and a scoop at the end of the lander’s robotic arm.\n\n“Domestic and overseas scientists will all have a chance to get the lunar samples to be brought back by Chang’e 5 for research,” said Pei Zhaoyu, deputy director of the Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center of the China National Space Administration, in a report published by China’s state-run Xinhua news agency.\n\nJames Head, a planetary scientist at Brown University, told Spaceflight Now that international collaboration in the sample analysis will help foster greater scientific discoveries.\n\n“Analysis of returned samples often requires very specialized and costly, sometimes unique, equipment and laboratories, that are not always evenly distributed worldwide,” Head said in a written response to questions from Spaceflight Now. “This means that national and international collaborations are really important in order to optimize the sample analyses. And of course, the amount of samples returned is not huge, and easily exhausted, so all of this needs to be factored into the distribution and optimization of returned samples.\n\n“In Apollo, sample analysis were open to proposals from the international scientific community,” Head wrote.\n\n“All of Apollo and Luna sites selected for sampling were old,” said Brett Denevi, a planetary geologist at the Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory. “And of the sites that were on terrain shaped by volcanism, the volcanic eruptions occurred over 3 billion years ago.\n\n“What is exciting about the Chang’e 5 sampling location is that it is on a volcanic deposit that may have formed closer to 1 billion years ago,” Denevi said. “That might sound old still, but for the moon, that would have been the last major gasp of volcanism, so those samples will give us what may have been the final chapter in the story of volcanic eruptions on the moon and how the interior of the moon evolved over time as eruptions waned.”\n\nDenevi said once the Chang’e 5 samples are dated, scientists will have a “new anchor point” to estimate ages of planetary surfaces across the solar system.\n\n“Older surfaces have more craters, younger surfaces have fewer, and because Apollo and Luna samples from those surfaces are mostly old, we know fairly well how the density of craters on a surface translates to its age,” she said. “So for places like the Moon, Mars, and Mercury we can estimate the ages of different regions based on how many impact craters have formed on them, even if we don’t have rocks from those regions.\n\n“But for younger surfaces, we are doing a pretty rough estimate,” Denevi said. “We have no rocks of known age from a known surface between 1 and 3 billion years old. Chang’e 5 will change that, and allow us to better interpret the timing of events across the inner solar system.”\n\nChina’s next lunar mission, Chang’e 6, is similar to Chang’e 5 and will attempt to return rocks from the moon’s south pole region. It is scheduled to launch in 2023, according to Chinese space officials.\n\nFuture Chang’e missions will test out technologies for a future research station on the lunar surface, paving the way for Chinese astronauts to land on the moon, Chinese officials said.\n\nEmail the author.\n\nFollow Stephen Clark on Twitter: @StephenClark1.",

        "content": "China's unmanned spacecraft carrying rocks and soil from the Moon returned safely to Earth\n\nAn unmanned Chinese spacecraft carrying rocks and soil from the Moon returned safely to Earth early Thursday, completing another chapter in China's effort to become a space superpower.\n\nThe mission was the first in four decades to collect lunar samples, emulating the feats of the United States and the Soviet Union from the 1960s and 1970s—and going a few steps further.\n\nScientists hope the samples will give insights into the Moon's origins and volcanic activity, though a more immediate focus was on how the mission showcased China's technological advances.\n\n\"China has been preparing for this for a long time,\" Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics researcher, told AFP.\n\n\"This was very important to them—and still risky, as the automatic rendezvous, docking and sample transfer in lunar orbit had never been done before, by anyone. It's a sign of the maturity of the Chinese space effort that it went off so flawlessly.\"\n\nIn images broadcast on state television, the blackened capsule landed on snow-covered grasslands in darkness in the country's remote north.\n\nA Chinese flag was quickly placed next to the capsule, reflecting the nationalist pride that the multi-billion-dollar space programme engenders.\n\nThe mission was another successful chapter in China's effort to become a space superpower\n\nSpace dream\n\nChina launched its first satellite in 1970 but human spaceflight took decades longer—with Yang Liwei becoming the country's first \"taikonaut\" in 2003.\n\nUnder President Xi Jinping, who took power in 2012, China's \"space dream\" has been put into overdrive.\n\nA Chinese lunar rover landed on the far side of the Moon in January 2019, a global first.\n\nThe official Xinhua news agency described the latest mission as one of the most challenging and complicated in China's aerospace history.\n\nChang'e-5—named after a mythical Chinese Moon goddess—landed on the Moon on December 1.\n\nDuring two days on the Moon, it collected two kilogrammes (4.5 pounds) of material in an volcanic area called Mons Ruemker in the Oceanus Procellarum—or \"Ocean of Storms\"—which was previously unexplored, China's space agency said.\n\nWhile there it also raised the Chinese flag, according to the agency.\n\nThe mission was another successful chapter in China's effort to become a space superpower\n\nThe probe's departure was also the first time China had achieved take-off from an extraterrestrial body.\n\nThe module then went through the delicate operation of linking up in lunar orbit with the part of the spacecraft that brought the samples back to Earth.\n\nThe probe comprised separate craft to get to the Moon, land on it and collect the samples, get back up and then return the rocks and soil to Earth.\n\nThe return capsule entered the Earth's atmosphere at an altitude of about 120 kilometres (75 miles).\n\nWhen it was about 10 kilometres above land, a parachute opened and it landed smoothly, the space agency said.\n\n'Confidence'\n\n\"With this successful mission, China will be more confident of its own technologies,\" Chen Lan, an independent analyst at GoTaikonauts.com, which specialises in China's space programme, told AFP.\n\nThomas Zurbuchen, a top official at NASA's science mission directorate, also congratulated China on the safe return of the capsule.\n\nThe Chang'e-5 lunar probe gathering samples on the Moon—it has now returned safely to Earth\n\n\"The international science community celebrates your successful Chang'e 5 mission,\" he tweeted.\n\n\"These samples will help reveal secrets of our Earth-Moon system (and) gain new insights about the history of our solar system.\"\n\nThe capsule will be airlifted to Beijing for opening, and the Moon samples will be delivered to a research team for analysis and study.\n\nChina had already said it would be willing to share the samples from the moon, and the space agency's director said after the capsule landed that Beijing would \"cooperate extensively\" with global scientists.\n\nChinese officials said some of the moon material would be displayed in the country's National Museum and others would be sent to Mao Zedong's hometown in central China, as a tribute to the late Chinese Communist Party leader.\n\nChina's future space goals include creating a powerful rocket capable of delivering payloads heavier than those NASA and private rocket firm SpaceX can handle.\n\nIt is aiming for a crewed space station by 2022 and eventually to send humans to the Moon.\n\n© 2020 AFP",

        "content": "The basaltic meteorite is a piece of lunar rock that formed in a lava flow 2.35 billion years ago, long after volcanism on the moon was supposed to have ended.\n\nA meteorite that fell from the moon and was found in Africa is a rare volcanic rock dating from a time period in lunar history that scientists know little about.\n\nThe 311-gram space rock was discovered in 2023 and is known as the Northwest Africa 16286 meteorite — and based on the decay of the lead isotopes that it contains, its formation has been dated to about 2.35 billion years ago.\n\n\"Its age and composition show that volcanic activity continued on the moon throughout this timespan, and our analysis suggests an ongoing heat-generation process within the moon, potentially from radiogenic elements decaying and producing heat over a long period,\" said lead researcher Joshua Snape of the University of Manchester in a statement.\n\nThe meteorite is an important piece in the jigsaw that is the moon's history, filling-in an almost billion-year-long gap in our knowledge. The meteorite is much younger than samples brought back to Earth by NASA's Apollo missions, the Soviet Union's Luna missions and China's Chang'e 6 mission, all of which range between 3.1 billion and 4.3 billion years old, but older than the 1.9-billion-year-old rocks returned by Chang'e 5.\n\nCrucially, meteorite 16286 has a volcanic origin, with geochemical analysis showing that it formed when a lava flow from deep within the moon vented onto the surface and solidified. It contains relatively large crystals of a mineral called olivine, moderate levels of titanium and high levels of potassium. Its lead isotopes also point to a volcanic source deep underground that has an unusually high uranium-to-lead ratio (the lead being a decay product of uranium). This abundance of uranium, and the heat it produced as it underwent radioactive decay, is a potential clue as to what was keeping volcanism going a billion years after the moon's main bouts of volcanism had ceased.\n\nA scanning electron microscope image of a piece of the lunar meteorite 16286. The different shades of grey highlight the different minerals in the rock. (Image credit: Dr Joshua Snape / University of Manchester)\n\nThere are only 31 volcanic lunar rocks that have been found on Earth in the form of meteorites, and meteorite 16286 is by far the youngest.\n\n\"Moon rocks are rare, so it's interesting when we get something that stands out and looks different to everything else,\" said Snape.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe meteorite is more evidence that volcanism continued throughout this period on the moon; Chang'e 5 has found such evidence in its samples from the moon's farside of volcanism in the past 123 million years. Together, these discoveries are transforming what we thought we thought we knew about the moon's volcanism and how the moon has remained geologically active, at least in bursts, almost to the present day.\n\nThe next step is to pinpoint the meteorite's origin on the moon: likely a crater blasted into the surface by an impact that ejected the meteorite long ago. Once identified, it will be a prime location for a future sample-return mission to learn more about lunar volcanism during this little-known period, from which so few samples exist.\n\nSnape presented the findings at the world's premier geochemistry meeting, the Goldschmidt Conference in Prague held between July 6 and July 11.",

These samples include core samples sealed on the lunar surface, frozen samples, and samples stored in Helium. The Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) initiative was designed to examine these original, untouched samples that were wisely set aside in anticipation of future, greatly evolved investigatory capabilities. Now, 50 years later we can apply modern advanced instrumentation and processes to learn more than we were capable of observing in the Apollo era. Nine teams with over 50 scientists and engineers will participate in this initiative. This initiative is essentially a new and inexpensive lunar sample return mission that offers new perspectives on lunar volatile reservoirs and processes shaping the Moon. The results of this initiative will also provide a fundamental reference point for Artemis and future lunar exploration.\n\nPictured is one of the last unopened Apollo-era moon samples collected nearly 50 years ago.

        "content": "New research reveals that even lunar samples once believed to be pristine have been extensively altered by meteorite impacts, challenging long-held assumptions about the moon’s formation and early history.\n\nA team of scientists from Arizona State University, the University of Rochester and UCLA has developed a groundbreaking analytical tool. This tool, a fundamental principle in lunar science, analyzes aluminum content in zircon crystals and compares it with surrounding glass in lunar samples. The result is a powerful method that determines whether these materials formed together or were later assembled through impacts.\n\n“We designed this aluminum-in-zircon method specifically to test the ‘pristine rock’ hypothesis that has shaped lunar science for decades,” said Melanie Barboni, assistant professor at ASU’s School of Earth and Space Exploration and lead author of a paper detailing their findings, recently published in Nature Communications.\n\nA close-up of Apollo 17 lunar core sample 73001 being taken out of its drive tube for the first time since it was collected by Apollo astronauts in December 1972 at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. Photo courtesy of NASA/Robert Markowitz\n\nThe \"pristine rock\" hypothesis posits that certain lunar rocks, believed untouched by impact events, provide a direct record of the moon’s early history.\n\n“We discovered that zircon crystals and their surrounding materials don’t match chemically — proving they didn’t form together. This means what we thought were untouched igneous rocks are complex mixtures created by repeated impact events,” Barboni said.\n\nFor billions of years, the moon’s surface has been bombarded by asteroids and comets, forming the craters we see today. Scientists had believed specific rock fragments collected during Apollo missions had escaped this violent history, preserving an unaltered record of the moon’s origins.\n\nThe findings have profound implications. Many theories about the moon’s formation and early evolution are based on these supposedly pristine samples. With this new evidence, researchers are now faced with the task of revisiting key aspects of lunar science, including the timing of the moon’s formation and the development of its early crust.\n\n“Our study highlights the need for advanced geochemical tools tailored to different lunar rock types,” Barboni said. “The aluminum-in-zircon method works for zircon-bearing samples, but researchers must develop similar techniques for other crucial lunar materials.”\n\nThe study was funded by NASA and utilized samples collected during the Apollo missions.\n\nAs NASA prepares to return humans to the moon with the Artemis program, this research underscores the importance of specialized analytical techniques and collecting samples from areas far from significant impact basins — particularly the lunar far side, where truly pristine rocks may still exist.",

        "content": "BCA simulations have been used for decades and are still an active topic in research and development46,47,48. Nonetheless, common modeling approaches struggle with correctly describing sputter yields for compound materials (Fig. 1). At 45° incidence, the SRIM result for H is off by a factor of 8.2 from our regolith yields, which is particularly relevant as 45° yields were used to account for lunar surface roughness in previous exosphere models12. For more grazing incidences, the overestimation grows beyond an order of magnitude. It is thus evident that SRIM cannot reliably predict sputter yields for the lunar surface. This was to be expected, as the shortcomings of SRIM have been known and its use, particularly for energies in the solar wind relevant regime, is discouraged49,50,51,52,53. Also, the overestimation of the sputter yield by SRIM for mineral samples has been shown repeatedly22,23,27. Nevertheless, SRIM is still being used in recent literature42,54,55. As an alternative, SDTrimSP has been suggested, as its predictions are in better agreement with experimental results22,23,24,27,56. However, also for this code, parameter adaptations (or scaling) are necessary to reproduce sputter yields measured in experiments.\n\nOne possible shortcoming hindering a better understanding of the sputtering process in the BCA picture is the knowledge gap concerning surface binding energies (SBEs). The SBE directly influences the sputter yield57,58 and is often approximated as the energy of sublimation59,60. This view, however, is debated, and subsequently, a substantial amount of research has been carried out on the physical meaning of the SBE and its importance for sputtering, also in the space sciences context16,22,33,35,46,47,61. As the SBE is strongly related to the energy spectra of sputtered ejecta62, measurements of ejecta energy distributions could potentially clarify these matters and improve BCA simulations. However, few data are currently available for relevant compound materials, and only some data sets have been published for metallic samples or alkali halides63,64,65,66. For the time being, the model used in SpuBase67,68 is the one studied BCA model closest to the experiment, where the binding energy approach is physically motivated and does not stem from fitting to a data set. Nonetheless, the remaining uncertainties in the BCA codes underline the necessity to validate simulated sputter yields with available experimentally measured data sets.\n\nIn addition to the overestimation by simulations, surface morphology further reduces the effective sputter yields (Fig. 2). A similar sputter yield reduction was found when comparing enstatite (MgSiO 3 ) thin film and pressed pellet samples and this effect was ascribed to surface roughness24. Indeed, a joint experimental and numerical study demonstrated that surface morphology is capable of lowering the sputter yield and highlighted a correlation between this decrease and the mean of the surface inclination angle distribution69. Furthermore, this result was reinforced by an analytical investigation arriving at the same conclusion70. In this work, the pellet roughness (cf. Sample characterization) is comparable to the one in the mentioned enstatite study24, as are the measured sputter yield reductions. In a further step, Cupak et al.69 provide a Monte-Carlo-style algorithm called SPRAY that allows the calculation of sputter yields from atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of a given sample if the flat surface sputter yields are known. That way, any deviations from flat surface sputter yields are unambiguously attributable to surface morphology, as no other simulation parameter is varied. We found excellent agreement to our experimental results using this approach as well, pointing towards surface roughness as the main driver behind the observed sputter yield reduction for the pellet samples. Moreover, these additional simulation results also match with the SDTrimSP-3D data. We are thus confident that the 3D simulations capture the surface structure effects well, once the initial material-dependent overestimation is corrected. We give the SPRAY results and a more in-depth description of the code in Supplementary Fig. 1 and the Supplementary Discussion. Additionally, the observed matching sputter yields for α = 45° and the reduction to about half of the thin film sputter yield at 60° match well with analytical predictions for the given roughness70.\n\nIn contrast to these morphology effects, we do not expect crystallinity to play a role in the sputter yield modifications. While it is known that crystal structure has an effect on the sputtering properties of a sample71 and that the sputtering behavior of amorphous and polycrystalline samples is not necessarily the same72, these considerations are irrelevant in the context of this study: Our flat samples are amorphous by the nature of their production process23,28. The pellets were pressed not from pristine minerals, but rather from regolith that naturally expresses amorphous rims around its crystalline sample fraction. Although fresh surfaces might have been created by breaking grains during the pellet pressing process, a 4 keV He fluence of 7.31 × 1017 cm−2 was applied to the samples during the first preparatory irradiation. It was shown that a 4 keV He fluence of 5 × 1016 cm−2 is sufficient to amorphize a rim of olivine ((Mg,Fe) 2 SiO 4 ) with a resulting thickness of several 10 nm73. We therefore deem both the thin film and the pellet experimental results comparable to the (amorphous) BCA simulations both in the 1D and 3D configuration, and suitable to benchmark these very numerical results. Sputter yield data for the rough pellets match excellently between experiments and SDTrimSP-3D simulations after applying the same correction factor determined in Fig. 1 from flat sample data. It is thus justified to apply the same procedure to the porous regolith structures. Consequently, these regolith sputter yields should be used as realistic supply rates when modeling the lunar exosphere formation by solar wind ion impact. The fact that these sputter yields are notably lower than assumptions after models without experimental validation is, moreover, well in line with the findings that micrometeoroid impact vaporization might be the more dominant driver of particle ejection into the lunar exosphere44.\n\nIn the past years, various studies reported sputter yields for lunar analog materials that were measured using the same method as described in this paper, where mass changes of flat, amorphous films were resolved by means of a QCM. Figure 3 compares the Apollo 68501 laboratory sputter yields from this work to data from wollastonite (CaSiO 3 )22,23, augite ((Ca,Mg, Fe) 2 Si 2 O 6 )74, and enstatite (MgSiO 3 )24. In addition, the yields predicted by both SpuBase and SDTrimSP using the parameters by Szabo et al.22 without scaling are shown. Both the regolith and the mineral samples share a similar composition with O and Si abundances of roughly 60 at.% and 20 at.%, respectively. As the sputter yield in the equilibrium is governed by the bulk stoichiometry, one would expect similar total mass yields across these samples, with the differences arriving from the variation of the metal species. This is the case, and most of the single-mineral data points lie between our Apollo data and the model predictions for the regolith composition. Moreover, this is also the reason why the total mass sputter yield is rather robust against slight deviations in sample composition: A variation in abundance of two or three percentage points of a given species will not manifest in resolvable changes of the mass yield. Even though some components in our samples, mostly minor in abundance, might deviate within this range from the literature concentrations (cf. Table 1 and Section Sample characterization), this does not alter the measured sputter yields, because these species contribute little to the total yield. We further elaborate on this point in Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3.\n\nFig. 3: Compilation of experimentally measured sputter yields Y over incidence angle α. A Sputter yields under H ion bombardment. B Sputter yields for He ion bombardment. Data are shown for both this study (blue circles) and previous investigations using analogs (augite74, purple circles; wollastonite22,23, orange circles; and enstatite24, red circles), compared to two approaches of SDTrimSP simulations22,67 (grey dashed and teal solid lines, respectively) applied to the composition of the Apollo 16 sample 68501. For all cases, data are compared for flat samples. Connecting lines between experimental data are interpolated using a monotonic cubic spline to guide the eye. Experimental error bars are estimated from ion current fluctuations during the measurements and from the quality of fits to the QCM resonance frequency (this study), or taken from literature for the case of the previously published data. Full size image\n\nTable 1 Sample compositions Full size table\n\nNote that the yields measured from the lunar material are the lowest across all numerical and laboratory data sets (Fig. 3). While the models work well for individual minerals46, they overestimate data for the case of the more complex Apollo soil. Sample roughness and composition cannot be the reason for this discrepancy, as these parameters are well-controlled experimentally across all these studies and comparable to the simulated cases. A more likely explanation could be the formation of bonds that exceed the ones typically found within an amorphous silicate layer. For example, both the compound binding model46 and the Szabo et al.22 approach reach the best agreement with laboratory data, assuming the importance of oxygen in the bond structure, either considering the oxide formation energy or by directly increasing the oxygen binding energy, followed by averaging of all the binding energies. This neglects bonds that could form between species of the different minerals. Should those bonds be stronger than the ones found in the bulk material, then the resulting higher binding energy would provide an explanation for the lower sputter yields. Another way of reducing yields would be by decreasing the target density and consequently increasing the binary collision mean free path. It is unclear why these effects are not found in glassy thin films of single mineral analogs. We propose that the high number of components in the Apollo sample would favor the formation of either longer (lower density) or stronger bonds (higher BEs) than are found in its components. This is mirrored in the way SpuBase handles such complex materials: Rather than assuming a glass of homogeneous composition (as is the case for the film on the QCMs and more standard SDTrimSP models22), they are decomposed from constituent minerals. While the difference between experiments and models underlines the necessity for experimental validation, particularly for complex samples, the proposed explanation can be tested by measurements of ejecta energy distributions of both the Apollo samples and the individual minerals. In addition to the arguments in the previous sections, this highlights once more the necessity for laboratory studies on sputtered ejecta energy distributions.",

        "content": "A team of researchers, including Arizona State University geochemist Melanie Barboni, in collaboration with scientists from The University of Chicago, have made a new discovery about the history of the moon using lunar rocks from Apollo missions. Their findings suggest the moon solidified approximately 4.43 billion years ago, shedding new light on both lunar and Earth history.\n\nA lingering mystery\n\nThe moon has captivated humans for millennia, yet much about its origins remains uncertain. Scientists theorize that a massive collision between Earth and another celestial body led to the formation of the moon. However, determining the exact timeline of this event has been a challenge.\n\nNow, using cutting-edge techniques to analyze rare minerals in Apollo moon rock samples, researchers have obtained a precise age for when the moon crystallized. The new findings not only refine our understanding of lunar history but also offer insights into the time when Earth became habitable.\n\nThe results of their study have been recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n“Determining when the moon’s magma ocean crystallized has been an open question for decades,” said Barboni, an assistant professor with ASU’s School of Earth and Space Exploration. “This study refines that timeline, showing that the final stages of lunar solidification happened earlier than some previous estimates suggested. Understanding this process helps us link the moon’s evolution to early-Earth history.”\n\nPinpointing the moon’s age\n\nThe solar system formed about 4.57 billion years ago, and shortly thereafter, planets and moons took shape. Scientists believe a cataclysmic impact between Earth and another body created a molten mass that eventually became the moon. Initially, this young moon was a massive sphere of magma floating in space. Most of this magma cooled relatively quickly on a geological scale — within about 1,000 years — but a final phase of crystallization remained elusive.\n\nTo determine when the moon fully solidified, researchers focused on a distinct mineral layer rich in potassium, rare earth elements and phosphorus (known as KREEP). These elements accumulated as the moon’s magma ocean cooled, and scientists theorized that dating this layer would provide a reliable estimate for the moon’s final crystallization.\n\nLunar rock clues\n\nA key part of this study was analyzing the radioactive decay of lutetium, an element found in KREEP. Over billions of years, lutetium gradually transforms into hafnium at a known rate. By measuring the ratio of these elements in moon rocks and comparing them with meteorites from the same era, the researchers determined when the KREEP layer formed — placing the moon’s crystallization at 4.43 billion years ago.\n\nThese findings suggest the moon itself likely formed around 4.45 billion years ago, since studies indicate it would have taken about 20 million years to cool to that level. This time frame also marks a critical period in Earth’s history, as the moon-forming impact was likely the last major event shaping our planet before it stabilized and became hospitable to life.\n\n“This work shows why returning to the moon is so important,” Barboni emphasized. “Apollo gave us an incredible foundation, but there are still so many questions left unanswered. With Artemis and future sample return missions, we’ll be able to test ideas that were unthinkable in the Apollo era.”\n\nAstronaut Charles M. Duke Jr. collects samples of moon rocks during the Apollo 16 mission. These samples give us priceless information about the moon. Photo by John W. Young/courtesy of NASA\n\nArizona’s role in lunar exploration\n\nArizona has long played a crucial role in lunar and planetary research. Institutions such as Arizona State University and the University of Arizona have contributed significantly to moon and Mars exploration. The state's unique desert landscapes have even served as training grounds for Apollo astronauts.\n\n“Arizona has a strong legacy in planetary science, and that tradition continues today,” Barboni said. “From laboratory studies to mission planning, we are deeply involved in shaping the future of lunar exploration.”\n\n“These findings provide a clearer picture of how and when the moon formed, which in turn helps us understand Earth’s own history,” said first author Nicolas Dauphas, who heads the UChicago Origins Laboratory and is a professor in the Department of the Geophysical Sciences and the Enrico Fermi Institute. “With upcoming lunar missions like Artemis, we are on the brink of even more exciting discoveries.”\n\nAs new missions prepare to return humans to the moon, Arizona’s scientific community remains at the forefront of research, helping to unlock the mysteries of our celestial neighbor.",

        "content": "Chang'e 5 lands on moon, starts surface operations\n\nAt the climax of a landmark mission, China's Chang'e 5 robotic lunar probe has started gathering lunar rocks and soil after landing on the moon late on Tuesday night.\n\nChang'e 5 is expected to work for about two days in a region to the north of Mons Ruemker, a mountain overlooking a vast lunar mare called Oceanus Procellarum, or the Ocean of Storms, on the western edge of the moon's near side. After the surface operations are completed, it will bring about 2 kilograms of lunar samples back to Earth in mid-December, 44 years after the last substances from the moon were returned to Earth, according to the China National Space Administration.\n\nAs the landing procedures began as scheduled at 10:57 pm, the lander-ascender combination of the 8.2-metric ton Chang'e 5 started its 7,500-newton-thrust engine to reduce its flying speed and began to descend toward the moon from about 15 kilometers above the lunar surface.\n\nWhen the lander-ascender reached an altitude of 2.5 km, it conducted a rapid positional adjustment and continued approaching the lunar surface.\n\nDuring the engine-assisted process, cameras on the lander-ascender took pictures of the landing site and transmitted them to computers to identify possible hazards on the surface such as large rocks so the craft could maneuver to avoid them.\n\nThe lander-ascender suspended its descent when it was about 100 meters from the moon and hovered for a short time to carry out accurate detection of obstacles before continuing to descend at a slower, steady speed.\n\nAt the last moment of the challenging operation when the craft was several meters above the surface, its engine stopped and it touched down on the lunar surface at 11:11 pm, becoming the third spacecraft to successfully land on the moon in the 21st century. The other two craft that had achieved this feat-Chang'e 3 and 4-were also from China.\n\nAfter landing, it embarked on tasks such as using a technically advanced drill to retrieve rocks from 2 meters beneath the lunar surface and gathering soil from the surface with a mechanical arm.\n\nChina's largest and most sophisticated lunar probe, Chang'e 5 was launched by a Long March 5 heavy-lift carrier rocket on Nov 24 at the Wenchang Space Launch Center in Hainan province, undertaking the world's first mission since 1976 to return lunar samples to Earth.\n\nThe spacecraft has four components-an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a reentry capsule.\n\nBefore landing, Chang'e 5 separated into two parts-the orbiter-reentry capsule combination and the lander-ascender combination-early on Monday morning.\n\nWhile the lander-ascender has started surface operations, the orbiter-reentry capsule is in lunar orbit at an average altitude of about 200 km above the moon, according to the space administration.\n\nAfter the collection and packing operations are completed, a 3,000-newton-thrust engine on the ascender will lift it to rendezvous and dock with the reentry module. It will transfer the lunar samples to the module and then separate from it.",

(Xinhua/Sun Weitong)\n\nSHANGHAI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The China National Space Administration (CNSA) announced on Thursday that scientists from institutions in France, Germany, Japan, Pakistan, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (U.S.) have been granted the opportunity to borrow lunar samples collected by the Chang'e-5 mission for scientific research.\n\nAt a ceremony for China's Space Day in Shanghai, the agency announced that seven institutions from six countries have been authorized to borrow the lunar samples.\n\nThe authorized institutions include the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP) in France, the University of Cologne in Germany, Osaka University in Japan, the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO), the Open University in UK, Brown University in U.S., and the State University of New York at Stony Brook in the United States.\n\nIn 2020, China's Chang'e-5 mission retrieved samples from the moon weighing about 1,731 grams.\n\nShan Zhongde, head of the CNSA, said China's lunar exploration program has always adhered to the principles of equality, mutual benefits, peaceful utilization and win-win cooperation, sharing achievements with the international community.\n\nHe added that CNSA will continue to accept international applications for lunar sample research, expressing hope that global scientists will make new discoveries that expand human knowledge and benefit humanity.\n\nIn November 2023, CNSA opened applications for international researchers to borrow Chang'e-5 lunar samples. By the end of December 2023, it had received 24 applications from 11 countries and international organizations.",

        "content": "China’s Chang’e-5 mission completed a tricky docking maneuver on Saturday, as it prepares to return the soil samples it collected from the Moon’s surface back to Earth.\n\nChang’e 5 launched on November 23rd atop a Long March 5 rocket, with four main spacecraft. The mission entered the lunar orbit on November 28th, and its lander and ascent vehicle landed on the Moon December 1st, while its service module remained in lunar orbit. The lander gathered rocks and soil, and on Saturday, docked in orbit with the service module. Those samples will now be put in a return capsule for the trip home, expected to land in Inner Mongolia later in December.\n\nIf the mission is successful, it will make China only the third country to return samples from the Moon, more than 50 years after the US Apollo missions. The last successful lunar sample return mission was the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 mission in 1976.\n\nAlso on Saturday, Japan’s Hayabusa2 mission landed in the Australian desert, after retrieving samples of the Ryugu asteroid.",

The move is in response to research suggesting that lava tube systems are present on the moon and Mars and could provide shielding from those worlds' harsh radiation environments.\n\n\"The underground volcanic lava pipes by the Jingbo Lake are the most similar environment on Earth to the underground space of the moon. I hope our forward-looking research can serve China's lunar exploration program,\" Li Jiaqi, a researcher at Peking University, told China Central Television (CCTV).\n\nChina is practicing robotic moon exploration in a lava cave here on Earth. (Image credit: CCTV)\n\nExperimental robots are already being used to test conducting autonomous exploration and multi-functional operations in the simulated lunar environment.\n\n\"Compared with traditional lunar roving vehicles and exploration robots, it has stronger environmental adaptability and flexibility,\" said Li Xianglong, a doctoral student from the Harbin Institute of Technology. \"When exploring the underground space of the moon for the future, it can possess more precise perception, decision-making and operation capabilities.\"\n\nStudents also set up seismometers in the area to serve as a reference for future lunar experiments. China's Chang'e 7 mission to the lunar south pole, set to launch sometime in 2026, will carry a seismograph to study the moon's interior and detect moonquakes, caused by tidal forces from Earth, and temperature changes affecting the lunar surface. China plans to establish an International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) in the 2030s.",

        "content": "New lunar sample research could help protect astronauts and uncover the origins of water on the moon.\n\nDust and rocks residing on the surface of the moon take a beating in space. Without a protective magnetosphere and atmosphere like Earth’s, the lunar surface faces continual particle bombardment from solar wind, cosmic rays, and micrometeoroids. This constant assault leads to space weathering.\n\nThe new NASA-funded research offers fresh insights into the phenomenon of space weathering.\n\nExamining Apollo lunar samples at the nanoscale, researchers have revealed risks to human space missions and the possible role of space weathering in forming some of the water on the moon.\n\nMost previous studies of the moon involved instruments mapping it from orbit. In contrast, this study allowed researchers to spatially map a nanoscale sample while simultaneously analyzing optical signatures of Apollo lunar samples from different regions of the lunar surface—and to extract information about the chemical composition of the lunar surface and radiation history.\n\nThe findings appear in Scientific Reports.\n\n“The presence of water on the moon is critical for the Artemis program. It’s necessary for sustaining any human presence and it’s a particularly important source for oxygen and hydrogen, the molecules derived from splitting water,” says Thomas Orlando, a’ professor in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Georgia Tech, cofounder and former director of the Georgia Tech Center for Space Technology and Research, and principal investigator of Georgia Tech’s Center for Lunar Environment and Volatile Exploration Research (CLEVER).\n\nAs a NASA SSERVI (Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute), CLEVER is an approved NASA laboratory for analysis of lunar samples and includes investigators from multiple institutes and universities across the US and Europe. Research areas include how solar wind and micrometeorites produce volatiles, such as water, molecular oxygen, methane, and hydrogen, which are all crucial to supporting human activity on the moon.\n\nFor this work, the Georgia Tech team also tapped the University of Georgia (UGA) Nano-Optics Laboratory run by Professor Yohannes Abate in the physics and astronomy department. While UGA is a member of CLEVER, its nano-FTIR spectroscopy and nanoscale imaging equipment was historically used for semiconductor physics, not space science.\n\n“This is the first time these tools have been applied to space-weathered lunar samples, and it’s the first we’ve been able to see good signatures of space weathering at the nanoscale,” says Orlando.\n\nNormal spectrometers are at a much larger scale, with the ability to see more bulk properties of the soil, explains Phillip Stancil, professor and head of the UGA physics department.\n\nThe UGA equipment enabled the study of samples “in tens of nanometers.” To illustrate how small nanoscale is, Stancil says a hydrogen atom is .05 nanometers, so 1 nm is the size of 20 atoms if placed side by side. The spectrometers provide high-resolution details of the lunar grains down to hundreds of atoms.\n\n“We can look at an almost atomistic level to understand how this rock was formed, its history, and how it was processed in space,” Stancil says.\n\n“You can learn a lot about how the atom positions change and how they are disrupted due to radiation by looking at the tiny sample at an atomistic level,” says Orlando, noting that a lot of damage is done at the nanoscale level. They can determine if the culprit is space weathering or from a process left over during the rock’s formation and crystallization.\n\nThe researchers found damage on the rock samples, including changes in the optical signatures. That insight helped them understand how the lunar surface formed and evolved but also provided “a really good idea of the rocks’ chemical composition and how they changed when irradiated,” says Orlando.\n\nSome of the optical signatures also showed trapped electron states, which are typically missing atoms and vacancies in the atomic lattice. When the grains are irradiated, some atoms are removed, and the electrons get trapped. The types of traps and how deep they are, in terms of energy, can help determine the radiation history of the moon. The trapped electrons can also lead to charging, which can generate an electrostatic spark. On the moon, this could be a problem for astronauts, exploration vehicles, and equipment.\n\n“There is also a difference in the chemical signatures. Certain areas had more neodymium (a chemical element also found in the Earth’s crust) or chromium (an essential trace mineral), which are made by radioactive decay,” Orlando says. The relative amounts and locations of these atoms imply an external source like micrometeorites.\n\nRadiation and its effects on the dust and lunar surface pose dangers to people, and the main protection is the spacesuit.\n\nOrlando sees three key risks.\n\nFirst, the dust could interfere with spacesuits’ seals.\n\nSecond, micrometeorites could puncture a spacesuit. These high-velocity particles form after breaking off from larger chunks of debris. Like solar storms, they are hard to predict, and they’re dangerous because they come in at high-impact velocities of 5 kilometers per second or higher.\n\n“Those are bullets, so they will penetrate the spacesuits,” Orlando says.\n\nThird, astronauts could breathe in dust left on the suits, causing respiratory issues. NASA is studying many approaches for dust removal and mitigation.\n\nThe next research phase will involve combining the UGA analysis tools with a new tool from Georgia Tech that will be used to analyze Apollo lunar samples that have been in storage for over 50 years.\n\n“We will combine two very sophisticated analysis tools to look at these samples in a level of detail that I don’t think has been done before,” Orlando says.\n\nThe goal is to build models that can feed into orbital maps of the moon. To get there, the Georgia Tech and UGA team will need to go from nanoscale to the full macro scale to show what’s happening on the lunar surface and the location of water and other key resources, including methane, needed to support humanity’s moon and deep-space exploration goals.\n\nSource: Georgia Tech",

        "content": "China has landed on the moon again — and this time the country plans to bring home some souvenirs.\n\nChang'e 5 , China's first-ever sample-return mission, successfully touched down today (Dec. 1) in the moon's Ocean of Storms region, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said in a statement. The state-run CGTN news channel initially announced the landing success.\n\nChang'e 5 touched down on the moon at 10:11 a.m. EST (1511GMT, 11:11 p.m. Beijing Time) near Mons Rümker, a mountain in the Ocean of Storms (or Oceanus Procellarum), CNSA officials said. The probe deployed its solar array and antenna soon after to begin its work on the moon.\n\nTwo pieces of the four-module, 18,100-lb. (8,200 kilograms) Chang'e 5 mission hit the gray dirt today — a stationary lander and an ascent vehicle. If all goes according to plan, the lander will spend the next few days collecting about 4.4 lbs. (2 kg) of lunar material, some of it dug from up to 6.5 feet (2 meters) beneath the lunar surface.\n\nIn pictures: China on the moon! A history of Chinese lunar missions\n\nThe sample will then be transferred to the ascent vehicle, which will launch to lunar orbit and meet up with the other two Chang'e 5 elements — an orbiter and an Earth-return craft. The return vehicle will haul the moon dirt and rocks to our planet, with a touchdown planned in Inner Mongolia in mid-December.\n\nThat will be a landmark event; pristine lunar samples have not been delivered to Earth since 1976, when the Soviet Union's Luna 24 mission came home with about 6 ounces (170 grams) of material.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

A shadow from one of the lander's legs is visible on the lunar surface. (Image credit: China National Space Administration/CLEP)\n\nChang'e 5 just launched on Nov. 23 , so it's packing a lot of action into a few short weeks. The compressed timeline is driven largely by the mission's energy needs: The Chang'e 5 lander is solar powered, so it must get all of its work done in two Earth weeks at most, before the sun sets at Mons Rümker. (One lunar day lasts about 29 Earth days, so most moon sites receive two weeks of continuous sunlight followed by two weeks of darkness.)\n\nChang'e 5 is the latest mission in the Chang'e program of robotic lunar exploration, which is named after a moon goddess in Chinese mythology. The Chang'e 1 and Chang'e 2 orbiters launched in 2007 and 2010, respectively, and Chang'e 3 put a lander-rover duo down on the moon's near side in December 2013.\n\nThe Chang'e 5 T1 mission sent a prototype return capsule around the moon and back to Earth in October 2014 to help prepare for Chang'e 5. And in January 2019, the Chang'e 4 lander-rover duo pulled off the first-ever soft touchdown on the moon's mysterious, largely unexplored far side. Both Chang'e 4 robots remain operational today, as does the Chang'e 3 lander.\n\nThough Chang'e 5 has a very short operational life, the mission is designed to have a long-lasting impact. After all, scientists are still studying the 842 lbs. (382 kg) of lunar material brought to Earth by NASA's Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972.\n\nSome of the Apollo material came from Oceanus Procellarum, a huge volcanic plain that Apollo 12 explored in late 1969. But Mons Rümker rocks formed just 1.2 billion years ago, whereas all of the samples collected by the Apollo astronauts are more than 3 billion years old.\n\nChina's Chang'e 5 moon lander captured this view of the lunar surface as it approached its landing site in the Ocean of Storms region of the moon during a successful landing on Dec. 1, 2020 (Image credit: China National Space Administration/CLEP)\n\nChang'e 5 therefore \"will help scientists understand what was happening late in the moon's history, as well as how Earth and the solar system evolved,\" the nonprofit Planetary Society wrote in its description of the mission .\n\nChang'e 5 isn't the only sample-return game in town. Japan's Hayabusa2 mission is scheduled to deliver pieces of the asteroid Ryugu to Earth on Dec. 5, and NASA's OSIRIS-REx probe collected samples of the space rock Bennu in late October. The Bennu samples are scheduled to come home in September 2023.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated at 12 p.m. EST with additional details on Chang'e 5's successful moon landing from the China National Space Administration.",

        "content": "An artist's impression of the Chang'e 6 spacecraft on the surface of the moon in the SPA basin, communicating with Earth low on the horizon.\n\nThe origin of the strange differences between the near and far sides of the moon are a step closer to being solved, thanks to new findings from China's Chang'e 6 mission that returned samples from the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin.\n\nThe near side of the moon is familiar to us as the only side that we can see from Earth. Dark regions called maria are vast lava plains filling lowland impact basins, and give us the pattern of the \"man in the moon.\" Yet the far side of the moon, which can only be seen by orbiting spacecraft, has barely any maria and is covered by craggy, cratered and ancient highlands. That's not the only difference between the two hemispheres; the thickness of the moon's crust is thinner on the near side, volcanic activity appears to have occurred at different points in time, and the mantle beneath the far side seems heavily depleted in certain elements compared to the near side.\n\nHowever, while we have many samples from the lunar near side, particularly those brought back to Earth by the Apollo missions, the Soviet Luna missions and China's own Chang'e 5, we had nothing from the far side with which to test theories.\n\nThen, in June 2024, China's Chang'e 6 mission landed in the SPA basin and brought back samples totaling 1,935.3 grams (68.27 ounces).\n\nThe SPA basin is the largest impact site on the moon, spanning 2,500 kilometers (1,600 miles) and extends from the lunar south pole and onto the far side of the moon. It's also the oldest known impact feature on the moon, with an age of 4.25 billion years. What impact — pardon the pun — could the sheer violence of the SPA basin's formation have had on lunar geology and the thermal evolution of the moon's interior? Could it have caused the dichotomy between the moon's two hemispheres?\n\nChang'e 6's samples are the first from the lunar far side, and have offered a unique opportunity to test models that could potentially explain the difference between the moon's two hemispheres.\n\nConsequently, following analysis of the samples, researchers led by a team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have announced four major discoveries.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe first is that the samples contain volcanic rocks called basalts that date to prolonged volcanic outbursts on the lunar far side in two distinct phases, one around 4.2 billion years ago and another 2.8 billion years ago.\n\n\"We propose that the 4.2-billion-year-old basalt was associated with the formation of the SPA basin because it is a high-aluminum basalt, requiring the incorporation of crustal plagioclase into its source,\" Wei Yang, a professor at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told Space.com in an email interview. Meanwhile, \"the 2.8-billion-year-old basalts originated from the deep mantle, the product of the early stage crystallization of the lunar magma ocean.\"\n\nThe evolution of this lunar magma ocean that formed the moon's mantle is central to the next discovery, which is that geochemical analysis of the basalt samples points to a source in the lunar mantle deep below ground that is heavily depleted in particular elements such as thorium. It is unknown whether this depleted mantle is found only beneath the SPA basin, or whether it is more extensive across the moon.\n\nThe South Pole-Aitken basin extends 2,500 kilometers from the lunar south pole to the far-side crater Aitken. (Image credit: NASA/GSFC/Arizona State University.)\n\n\"To be honest, we don't know,\" said Yang.\n\nOne possibility is that the moon has had this depleted mantle since birth, in which case both the near and far sides should share this composition. The other possibility is that it was produced after the lunar magma ocean formed and began to crystallize.\n\n\"Personally, I am more inclined to believe the latter, given that such a massive impact has the potential to affect the mantle down to a depth of 250 kilometers [155 miles],\" said Yang. \"If it is only present in the SPA basin, then it must have formed as a result of the SPA impact. To figure this out, we need to collect more samples from the moon's far side, particularly from areas outside the SPA.\"\n\nThe third discovery is of something we wouldn't expect to find on the moon: water. However, we are talking parts-per-million here — the Apollo samples were considered \"bone dry,\" and the far side mantle seems to be even drier than that.\n\n\"The water content of this mantle is lower than those of the mantle sources of all the basalts from the near side,\" said Yang.\n\nThe final discovery relates to the moon's magnetic field. Earth's natural satellite currently doesn't have a global magnetic field, and traces of magnetism remain only in a handful of anomalous patches called lunar swirls. However, in the distant past it did have a global magnetic field. The Chang'e 6 samples retain a record of it, and show that the magnetic field, after decaying for a time, rebounded in strength about 2.8 billion years ago. This indicates that the moon's internal dynamo fluctuated, possibly episodically, rather than just experiencing a slow but gradual decline.\n\nThe timing coincides with the second phase of volcanism on the far-side.\n\n\"The magnetic field rebounded 2.8 billion years ago, which suggests that the interior of the moon still contained a lot of energy,\" said Yang. \"Perhaps convection and the upward flow of hot material existed in the lunar mantle at that time.\"\n\nNot only could this upward flow have triggered volcanic eruptions, it could have been enough to vaporize much of the water in the mantle, drying it out.\n\nIf the creation of the SPA basin is the cause of much of this, then it has repercussions that go far beyond the moon. Other giant impact features are seen on other bodies, particularly on Mercury and Mars. We may have underestimated the role that these giant impacts played on the evolution of the planets' interiors.\n\nThe Chang'e 6 results were presented in four papers (1, 2, 3, 4) that were published recently in the journal Nature.",

        "content": "A remarkable 2.35 billion year old meteorite found in Africa in 2023 has opened a new window into the Moon's volcanic history, filling a gap in our understanding of how Earth's closest neighbour evolved over billions of years.\n\nThe meteorite, officially named Northwest Africa 16286 (gets award for catchiest meteorite name!) represents the youngest basaltic lunar meteorite ever discovered on Earth.\n\nIts rare geochemical composition sets it apart from those returned by previous Moon missions, with chemical evidence indicating it likely formed from a lava flow that solidified after emerging from deep within the Moon.\n\nWhat makes this discovery particularly exciting is its timing. The meteorite's age is especially significant because it fills an almost billion year gap in lunar volcanic history. The rock bridges the age gap between older samples collected by Apollo, Luna, and Chang'e 6 missions and the much younger materials brought back by China's Chang'e 5 mission.\n\nRelated: Mysteriously Magnetic Moon Rocks Might Have an Explosive Origin Story\n\nThis age is crucial because it proves that volcanic activity continued on the Moon for much longer than previously documented in lunar samples. The rock provides evidence for the first time that the Moon retained internal heat generating processes that powered volcanic activity across multiple distinct phases throughout its history.\n\nThe 311 gram meteorite is a type of lunar volcanic basalt called olivine phyric basalt, containing relatively large crystals of the mineral olivine. Its chemical composition tells a fascinating story, it has moderate levels of titanium, high levels of potassium, and an unusually high uranium to lead ratio that serves as a unique geochemical fingerprint.\n\nThese chemical clues suggest the rock originated from deep within the Moon's interior, where ongoing heat generation processes, possibly from radioactive elements decaying over long periods, continued to drive volcanic activity billions of years after the Moon's formation. Unlike samples collected during expensive space missions, which are limited to specific landing sites, meteorites offer a different advantage.\n\n\"Lunar meteorites can potentially be ejected by impact cratering occurring anywhere on the Moon's surface. There's some serendipity surrounding this sample; it just happened to fall to Earth and reveals secrets about lunar geology without the massive expense of a space mission\" - Dr. Joshua Snape, Research Fellow at the University of Manchester.\n\nLike most meteorites with a lunar origin, the journey to Earth wasn't a gentle one. Its melted glassy pockets and veins suggest it was shocked by an asteroid or meteorite impact on the Moon's surface before being ejected into space and eventually falling to Earth. This impact event makes dating the rock more challenging, but researchers estimate its age with a margin of plus or minus 80 million years.\n\nAs researchers continue analysing this remarkable meteorite, it serves as a reminder that sometimes the most significant scientific discoveries come not from expensive space missions, but from rocks that simply fall from the sky, carrying with them the secrets of worlds beyond our own.\n\nThis article was originally published by Universe Today.

        "content": "At around 10:13 a.m. Eastern Time today, the lander successfully landed at a site close to Mons Rümker, a volcanic formation in the Oceanus Procellarum region on the western edge of the near side of the moon. This area is thought to be home to lunar rocks that are a couple of billion years younger than those the Apollo program brought back. Chang'e 5 is expected to begin drilling into the lunar ground for subsurface samples almost immediately.\n\nDigging for moon rocks: Chang’e 5 will aim to scoop up at least four pounds of material from the moon. One-quarter will be from underground samples (about 6.5 feet deep), and the other three-quarters from surface material. Unlike its lunar rover predecessor, Chang’e 5 isn’t equipped with with any heating units to protect its more sensitive components from the frigid temperatures of the lunar night. That means the mission only has 14 days (the length of the lunar day) to properly gather samples before it freezes to death (figuratively speaking).\n\nIn about 48 hours, the ascent vehicle will ferry the lunar samples up for a rendezvous with the orbiter, which will then place the samples into the return capsule and head back to Earth several days later. Upon nearing Earth, the orbiter will jettison the return capsule, which should land in Inner Mongolia by December 17.\n\nMaking history: At this point, China is no stranger to lunar missions. The country has pulled off four successful robotic missions to the moon, including the delivery of two rovers to the surface. Chang'e 5 is the third lunar landing for the country, but only its first ever sample return mission. Only the US and the former Soviet Union have ever brought lunar rocks back to Earth. If successful, this will be the first time in 44 years (since the Soviet Union’s Lunar 24 mission) that anyone has pulled off a lunar sample return mission.\n\nChang'e 6 is a follow-up lunar sample return mission that should launch in 2023. Though its ostensibly a backup to Chang'e 5, it would head toward the lunar south pole for samples instead of back to Mons Rümker should Chang'e 5 prove successful.",

        "content": "Timothy Glotch, a planetary scientist at Stony Brook University, leads one of only two United States research teams granted access to rare lunar materials collected by China’s Chang’e-5 mission, marking a significant moment of international scientific collaboration in space exploration.\n\nThe Chang’e-5 mission marks the first return of lunar samples to Earth in decades, and Glotch’s selection underscores his leading role in the field of planetary science. His team’s access to these unique materials, originating from a geologically younger and previously unsampled region of the Moon, presents an invaluable opportunity to advance our understanding of lunar history and evolution.\n\nStony Brook University officials have celebrated Glotch’s selection, highlighting it as a testament to the institution’s strength in geosciences and its continued contributions to space exploration research. This accomplishment reflects Stony Brook’s dedication to cultivating a vibrant research environment where, as Vice President for Research and Innovation Kevin Gardner affirms, “Professor Glotch’s expertise and groundbreaking access to these materials are powerful testaments to his work and the strength of Stony Brook’s research enterprise. The supportive framework we have cultivated is designed to empower our talented researchers to reach the highest levels of success, make meaningful contributions to global scientific understanding, and drive innovation in fields like remote sensing and materials science.”\n\nContributions to Planetary Science\n\nBeyond his groundbreaking access to the Chang’e-5 lunar samples, Glotch has established himself as a prominent figure in planetary science through his extensive research and involvement in numerous NASA missions. His primary research interest lies in understanding the mineralogy and composition of the surfaces of the Moon, Mars and asteroids.\n\nAs Glotch explained, “I’m really interested in their surfaces, and what the mineralogy and composition of the surfaces of those planets are, or planetary bodies are primarily as a tool to understand how they formed and evolved over time.” Unraveling the surface composition of planets and other space objects is crucial for understanding Earth’s own formation and evolution, potentially identifying valuable resources for future space endeavors, and inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers.\n\nHis approach involves a dual strategy, utilizing both remote sensing data collected by satellites orbiting these celestial bodies and conducting laboratory analyses of returned samples, including lunar and asteroid samples, as well as meteorites. A cornerstone of his analytical work, both in remote sensing and laboratory settings, is infrared spectroscopy. This technique allows him to identify the unique “infrared fingerprints” of different rocks, minerals, and even organic molecules, providing crucial insights into their composition.\n\n“You can think of every rock, every mineral, every organic molecule having essentially an infrared fingerprint that we can use to identify what we see on the surface,” Glotch noted. His lab at Stony Brook is equipped to analyze samples at scales ranging from millimeters down to tens of nanometers, allowing for both bulk and detailed investigations.\n\nGlotch is also deeply engaged with NASA’s space exploration endeavors. He serves as a co-investigator on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission, contributing to our understanding of the Moon’s surface. Furthermore, he and his colleague Deanne Rogers were previously participating scientists on the OSIRIS-REx mission, which successfully returned a sample from the asteroid Bennu.\n\nReflecting on this mission involvement, Glotch stated, “We have tons of mission work which is really exciting, because we get to look at some of that data before anybody else does. And we get to make exciting discoveries and be part of those science teams.”\n\nIn addition to his mission work, Glotch leads the RISE2 node of NASA’s Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI). This significant role involves fostering collaboration among scientists at Stony Brook, NASA and other institutions to advance research critical for upcoming human lunar exploration. The work within the RISE2 node encompasses a wide range of studies, including fieldwork, laboratory analysis of lunar samples and the interpretation of remote sensing data.\n\nThe planetary science group at Stony Brook, which includes Glotch, is a highly collaborative and intellectually vibrant environment. Several colleagues have also made significant contributions to Mars exploration, with involvement in the Mars rovers Curiosity and Perseverance, as well as the Mars Odyssey orbiter. This collective expertise and shared resources create a rich setting for cutting-edge research in the field.\n\nThrough his diverse research portfolio, mission involvement and leadership roles, Glotch’s work extends far beyond the current study of the Chang’e-5 samples, solidifying his impact on our understanding of the solar system.\n\nChang’e-5 Sample Selection\n\nIn 2023, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) initiated a highly competitive global call for research proposals to study the Chang’e-5 lunar samples, the first returned to Earth since the Apollo missions decades ago. This announcement sparked significant interest within the international scientific community, as these samples originate from a geologically younger and previously unexamined region of the Moon.\n\nGlotch, recognizing the immense scientific value of this opportunity, collaborated with colleagues from the University of Hong Kong and San Francisco State University to submit a detailed proposal. The selection process was rigorous, with numerous applicants submitting proposals to investigate the rare lunar material. Ultimately, only a select few international teams, including Glotch’s, were chosen, highlighting the strong merit and potential of their proposed research to contribute meaningfully to our understanding of the Moon.\n\nTheir proposal specifically requested both a soil sample and a thin section of rock, enabling a comprehensive analysis from a macroscopic to a microscopic level. The granting of access to these unique samples underscores the international recognition of Glotch’s expertise in planetary surface analysis and the potential for groundbreaking discoveries to emerge from his team’s investigation.\n\nFunding and Collaboration Challenges\n\nInitially, NASA was involved in negotiating a loan agreement with the CNSA to facilitate the transfer of the samples to U.S. researchers. Despite securing a Congressional exemption to the Wolf Amendment for U.S. investigators to study the lunar samples, negotiations for a loan agreement with the CNSA ultimately failed due to unresolved issues, leading to the reinstatement of the NASA funding restrictions for this collaboration. Glotch and his team were granted permission to proceed with the research using non-NASA funding. Stony Brook University has stepped in to provide the necessary financial support.\n\n“I really appreciate the support of the Vice President for Research and Innovation, the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, and my department chair. The departments have come up with internal funds for me to be able to travel to China, travel to the other institutions with the samples, do the work, and ultimately bring the samples back to Stony Brook,” Glotch explained.\n\nThe analysis of the Chang’e-5 samples by Glotch’s team promises to be a significant contribution to lunar science, further solidifying Stony Brook’s position as a leading research university in the planetary sciences. The timeline for the sample transfer and the commencement of research is expected to be announced by CNSA in the near future.\n\nResearch Focus and Significance\n\nGlotch’s research will focus on collecting infrared spectra of the Chang’e-5 soil samples under simulated lunar conditions to enable a more quantitative interpretation of lunar remote sensing data and collaborating with colleagues to make magnetic measurements of the samples to study space weathering. This research will also provide the CNSA with an absolute calibration of soil maturity measurements, enhancing the value of their sample analyses.\n\nGlotch emphasizes that planetary science research contributes to our understanding of Earth and inspires the next generation of planetary scientists. “The more we learn about other planets and how they form and how they evolve, the more we learn about the Earth,” Glotch stated. “Beyond expanding our understanding of space, planetary science inspires and trains the next generation of scientists and engineers. At Stony Brook, this is a key part of our research enterprise, providing valuable lab experience to students at all levels and cultivating future science leaders.”\n\nThe Chang’e-5 mission, which landed on the Moon in late 2020, brought back approximately 1,731 grams (around 3.8 pounds) of lunar regolith from a previously unsampled region of the Moon, a younger volcanic area known as Oceanus Procellarum. These samples are significant for planetary scientists, offering a new perspective on lunar history and evolution compared to the older samples collected by the Apollo missions. Glotch’s work underscores Stony Brook University’s vital role in driving cutting-edge research in the planetary sciences and our understanding of where we came from.",

        "content": "SpaceNews and Space Daily are both reporting today (December 22, 2020) that China’s Chang’e 5 mission – one component of which successfully returned rocks from the moon to Earth last week – is now heading for a gravitationally stable point in space, the sun-Earth Lagrange point known as L1. Hu Hao, chief engineer of the mission’s third stage, reported to the press on December 20 that more than 440 pounds (200 kg) of propellant remain: ample fuel to keep the orbiter mobile.\n\nThis extended mission follows the craft’s successful return of moon rocks to Earth last week, the first new moon samples in 44 years. The craft launched from Earth on November 23, 2020. The lander landed on the moon on December 1, and the return capsule brought about 60 ounces (3 3/4 pounds, or 1.731 kilograms) of lunar material back to Earth’s surface on December 16. The orbiter remained in space. According to SpaceNews:\n\nThe spacecraft is now heading to a sun-Earth Lagrange point to carry out observations of the local environment, the sun, and perform operational tests.\n\nEarthSky’s lunar calendar shows the moon phase for every day in 2021. Order yours before they’re gone!\n\nBroadcasters at the China Global Television Network reported on the spacecraft’s parachute return-landing last week in the East Asian country of Mongolia. The landing took place at around 1 p.m. Eastern Time (18:00 UTC) on Wednesday, December 16. The video below, from the South China Morning Post, tells the story of the return of lunar samples to Earth:\n\nThe samples returned to Earth in the Chang’e 5 capsule are the first moon rocks to arrive back on Earth since the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 mission in 1976.\n\nThe lunar landing site of the Chang’e 5 mission – the Mons Rumker area – was in the vast lunar volcanic plain known as Oceanus Procellarum (Ocean of Storms). Parts of this region on the moon have been explored by other moon missions, including NASA’s Apollo 12 in 1969. Rocks in the Mons Rumker region are thought to have formed just 1.2 billion years ago. In contrast, the moon rocks brought home by the Apollo astronauts – between 1969 and 1972 – are much older. The Planetary Society, a U.S. nonprofit space advocacy group, explained:\n\nThe samples should be the youngest ever returned to Earth: just 1.2 billion years old, when multicellular life may have already evolved on our planet. Chang’e-5 will help scientists understand what was happening late in the moon’s history, as well as how Earth and the solar system evolved.\n\nCheck out the video below, which has been making the rounds on social media. It consists of hundreds of photos stitched together to show Chang’e 5’s successful lunar landing:\n\nThe Chang’e 5 mission launched November 23 from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in China’s Hainan province. It was carried atop a Long March 5 rocket.\n\nChang’e 5 is not the only ongoing sample-return mission. Japan’s Hayabusa2 mission returned a lander from space to the continent of Australia on December 6, 2020; it brought pieces of the asteroid Ryugu collected over two years ago. More recently, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx probe took a sample of the asteroid Bennu; that material is expected to be returned to Earth in September 2023.\n\nAnd it seems that China has big plans for the moon. Speaking to astronauts aboard the Shenzhou 10 spacecraft through a video call in 2013, Chinese president Xi Jinping said:\n\nThe space dream is part of the dream to make China stronger. The Chinese people will take bigger strides to explore further into space.\n\nChina became the first country to send an unmanned rover to the far side of the moon last year. Last July, China launched its first unmanned mission to Mars – Tianwen-1 – expected to arrive in February 2021. If Tianwen-1 is successful, Beijing hopes eventually to send a manned mission to Mars. There are also plans to bring up a permanent space station by 2022, as well as sending astronauts back to the moon by the 2030s.\n\nIf this proves successful, China would become the second country in the world to put a human on the moon, after the U.S.\n\nBottom line: China’s robotic Chang’e 5 spacecraft is now heading for a gravitationally stable point in space, the sun-Earth Lagrange point known as L1, after another component of the craft returned successfully to Earth on December 16, loaded with moon rocks — the first since the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 mission in 1976.\n\nRead more from Space Daily: China’s Chang’e-5 orbiter embarks on new mission to gravitationally stable spot at L1\n\nRead more from SpaceNews: Chang’e-5 orbiter embarks on extended mission to sun-Earth Lagrange point\n\nRead more from Scientific American: China’s Chang’e-5 Mission Launches to Collect Lunar Samples",

        "content": "Van Horn, Texas: Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, and three crewmates soared high above the Texas desert aboard his space venture Blue Origin's New Shepard launch vehicle on Tuesday and returned to Earth, a historic suborbital flight that helps to inaugurate a new era of private commercial space tourism.\n\nThe spacecraft ignited its BE-3 engines for a liftoff from Blue Origin's Launch Site One facility about 20 miles (32 km) outside the rural town of Van Horn. There were generally clear skies with a few patchy clouds on a cool morning for the launch.\n\nBillionaire Jeff Bezos, founder of ecommerce company Amazon.com Inc, and his brother Mark board ahead of their scheduled flight aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket near Van Horn, Texas, US July 20, 2021 in a still image from video. Photo: Blue Origin/Handout via REUTERS.\n\nThe 57-year-old American billionaire flew on a voyage lasting about 10 minutes and 20 seconds to the edge of space, nine days after Briton Richard Branson was aboard his competing space tourism company Virgin Galactic's successful inaugural suborbital flight from New Mexico.\n\nThe mission was part of a fiercely competitive battle between Bezos' Blue Origin and fellow billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic to tap a potentially lucrative space tourism market the Swiss bank UBS estimates will be worth $3 billion annually in a decade.\n\nBezos, wearing a blue flight suit and cowboy hat, and the other passengers climbed into an SUV vehicle for a short drive to the launch pad before walking up a tower and getting aboard the gleaming white spacecraft, with a blue feather design on its side. Each passenger rang a shiny bell before boarding the craft's capsule.\n\nBillionaire businessman Jeff Bezos is launched with three crew members aboard a New Shepard rocket on the world's first unpiloted suborbital flight from Blue Origin's Launch Site 1 near Van Horn, Texas , US, July 20, 2021. Photo: REUTERS/Joe Skipper\n\n\"They are in for the flight of a lifetime,\" launch presenter Ariane Cornell of Blue Origin said on a live webcast.\n\nBranson got to space first, but Bezos was due to fly higher - 62 miles (100 km) for Blue Origin compared to 53 miles (86 km) for Virgin Galactic - in what experts call the world's first unpiloted space flight with an all-civilian crew. It represents Blue Origin's first crewed flight to space.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBezos, founder of ecommerce company Amazon.com Inc, and his brother Mark Bezos, a private equity executive, were joined by two others. Pioneering female aviator Wally Funk, 82, and recent high school graduate Oliver Daemen, 18, become the oldest and youngest people to reach space.\n\nThe capsule carrying billionaire businessman Jeff Bezos and three crew members returns by parachute after their flight aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket near Van Horn, Texas , US, July 20, 2021. Photo: REUTERS/Joe Skipper\n\nThe flight coincides with the anniversary of Americans Neil Armstrong and Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin becoming the first humans to walk on the moon, on July 20, 1969. New Shepard is named for Alan Shepard, who in 1961 became the first American in space.\n\nFunk was one of the so-called Mercury 13 group of women who trained to become NASA astronauts in the early 1960s but was passed over because of her gender. Daemen, Blue Origin's first paying customer, is set to study physics and innovation management in the Netherlands. His father, who heads investment management firm Somerset Capital Partners, was on site to watch his son fly to space.\n\nA general view of the Blue Origin New Shepard rocket booster at the 33rd Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States April 5, 2017. File photo: REUTERS/Isaiah J. Downing\n\nThe launch was witnessed by members of the Bezos family and Blue Origin employees, and a few spectators gathered along the highway before dawn. Spectators applauded during the flight.\n\nMinutes of weightlessness\n\nNew Shepard is a 60-foot-tall (18.3-meters-tall) and fully autonomous rocket-and-capsule combo that cannot be piloted from inside the spacecraft. It is completely computer-flown and had none of Blue Origin's staff astronauts or trained personnel onboard.\n\nVirgin Galactic used a space plane with a pair of pilots onboard.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNew Shepard was designed to hurtle at speeds upwards of 2,200 miles (3,540 km) per hour to an altitude of about 62 miles (100 km), the so-called Kármán line set by an international aeronautics body as defining the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space.\n\nAfter the capsule separates from the booster, the crew was due to have unbuckled for a few minutes of weightlessness. Then the capsule was due to fall back to Earth under parachutes, using a last-minute retro-thrust system that expels a \"pillow of air\" for a soft landing in the Texas desert.\n\nThe reusable booster had previously flown twice to space.\n\nNews Channel 9 Reporter Celina Quintana Ortiz prepares to go live in front of a Blue Origin Mural depicting Jeff and Mark Bezos, in Van Horn, Texas, U.S., July 20, 2021. Photo: REUTERS/Paul Ratje\n\nThe launch represented another step in the race to establish a space tourism sector that Swiss investment bank UBS estimates will reach $3 billion annually in a decade. Another billionaire tech mogul, Elon Musk, plans to send an all-civilian crew on a several-day orbital mission on his Crew Dragon capsule in September.\n\nOn Twitter, Musk wished the Blue Origin crew \"best of luck\" hours before the launch.\n\nBlue Origin aims for the first of two more passenger flights this year to happen in September or October.\n\nBlue Origin appears to have a reservoir of future customers. More than 6,000 people from at least 143 countries entered an auction to become the first paying customer. The auction winner, who made a $28 million bid, dropped out of Tuesday's flight, opening the way for Daemen. Virgin Galactic has said 600 people have booked reservations, priced at about $250,000 per ticket.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBranson has said he aims ultimately to lower the price to about $40,000 per seat.\n\nBezos has a net worth of $206 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He stepped down this month as Amazon CEO but remains its executive chairman.",

        "content": "A tale of two billionaire’s trips into space. (Picture courtesy of Virgin Atlantic)\n\nAs billionaires chase each other into space for no apparent reason, we are left to consider what might be interesting in the technology each has chosen to use.\n\nThe three billionaires, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson and Elon Musk, are among the world’s richest men. Each has more money than nations and more than they can spend in their lifetimes. The common methods of wealth dissipation available to the super-rich, yachts, private jets, sports teams, islands are insufficient, so they have come to man’s final frontier.\n\nWe are reminded of another billionaire, Bill Gates, also siphoning off his wealth, but choosing to spend his billions to fight poverty and disease worldwide.\n\nBut rather than go mad thinking of how others should spend their money, let us focus on the present assignment, finding out more about the technology involved in the billionaires' space race – despite the distraction, their high fives and this brazen admission of self-indulgence:\n\n“I want to thank every Amazon employee and every Amazon customer because you guys paid for all of this,” quipped Jeff Bezos after his 11-minute space joyride. The backlash was swift.\n\n“Space travel isn’t a tax-free holiday for the wealthy,” answered Oregon Representative Earl Blumenauer, pointing out that “billionaires flying into space” had “no scientific value.”\n\nA Little History Wouldn't Kill You\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaceShip Two shown here is the next generation. It is 18.3 m long and has a wingspan of 8.2 m. Like the older design, it is carried up to launch altitude by the White Knight Two carrier plane. (Picture courtesy of Virgin Galactic)\n\n\n\n\n\nBy contrast, Blue Origin and SpaceX offer the experience, some of the rigor and most of the risk of being a real astronaut. No doubt, two smart and self-directed men, Branson and Musk, who in their genius, have seized on the clearest solution and that is to get to space directly, vertically, the shortest path between two points a straight line, Occam’s Razer and all that. Of course, it must be a rocket. None of this dilly-dallying, travel in an airplane that by design needs to go forward a lot so it can go up a little. We’re going straight up, my well-heeled friends, and we are going on a rocket!\n\nWe’re not pausing to look at the rear-view mirror, the history of rocketry.\n\nThe first rockets may have been used as early as the 10th century by the Song dynasty in China (the same place that gave us gunpowder) to make “fire arrows.” Modern rocketry is credited to Wernher von Braun and it took off, as it were when Germany revived the rocket’s use as a weapon in World War II. The pointed, aerodynamic nose cone of the lethal and brutally destructive V-2 rocket was filled with an explosive warhead, inert until detonated.\n\nFrom the Right Stuff to the Stuff of Vanity\n\nThe first race into space started when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik into orbit, followed by the race to put a man in space. Someone had the brilliant idea of putting flesh and blood where previously had gone high explosives on top of a thin cylinder of sheet metal filled with rocket fuel. We tried desperately to control the enormous amount of chemical energy to make sure it went out the nozzle in a measured manner, a task for which the rocket often proved woefully inept. The film of explosions on and off launchpads was far too numerous. Death stalked the early “volunteers,” later dubbed astronauts, who were recruited from those who welcomed risk, saw deadly risk as to the supreme test of their manhood, and who were to become the heroes of Tom Wolfe’s bestselling The Right Stuff, which forever glorified the Navy's fighter test pilots.\n\nRichard Branson’s Virgin Galactic\n\nRichard Branson got the bragging rights by having the first private space company to carry ordinary people (all non-astronauts, including himself) into space on July 11. Not quite space, was the immediate response by Jeff Bezos’ Blue Shepard team, informing us that space starts at 100 km above the Earth (more on that later).\n\nThe carrier plane, called White Knight Two (a nod to Sir Richard Branson’s knighthood, perhaps?) looks like two jet planes welded together at their non-swept wingtips. Each fuselage has a full cabin. One fuselage has an interior similar to the spaceship (called VSS Unity or SpaceShip Two) that it carries aloft and is used for training. The other fuselage is planned for cheap seats, sold to space tourists on more of a budget, on flights up 18 km (60,000 ft), roughly twice the cruising altitude of a commercial flight -- not even close to the Kármán Line, but still a pretty good view.\n\nWhat is the Kármán Line?\n\nIn the 1900s, Hungarian physicist Theodore von Kármán rather arbitrarily determined the delineation between atmosphere and space occur around 50 miles up – about 80 km -- above sea level. It was later moved up to 100 km, if for no other reason than to produce a nice round number. However, agencies in the US recognize the original distance of 80 km as where space begins.\n\nKeep in mind no sharp distinction occurs at the Kármán line, whether it is at 80 km or 100 km. The air molecules gradually become less and less at that kind of distance.\n\nEuropean agencies, including the Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI), define space as beginning at 100 km up.\n\nVirgin Galactic’s White Knight Two shown in its hangar carrying SpaceShip Two between its two hulls. (Picture courtesy of Virgin Galactic) On the trip to space, White Knight Two, powered by four jet engines, took SpaceShip Two to 45,000 feet above sea level. There, it launches SpaceShip Two which used its rocket power to take Branson and his fellow voyagers to an apogee while it did a powered flight back to Earth. (Picture courtesy of Virgin Galactic)\n\nThe carrier plane, White Knight Two, is three times the size of the Ansari-prize winning, Burt Rutan design it is based on. Both White Knight Two and SpaceShip Two are built by Scaled Composites. Richard Branson formed The Spaceship Company in 2005 to fulfill his space travel dream, keeping 70% interest in the company, with the remainder went to Scaled Composites.\n\nThe passengers on SpaceShip Two, soon-to-be space travelers, fly up to the release point in a manner very similar to normal commercial flight, sitting comfortably upright. Everything changes upon release from the carrier plane (called an air-launch) when the pilot takes control, ignites the rocket engine and points the nose straight up. Seventy thousand pounds of thrust produced in about one minute will propel the spacecraft to Mach 4 and feel like 4Gs. Its fuel spent, the spaceship continues up due to momentum to an apogee 85 km. Yes, we know, Mr. Bezos, short of the Kármán Line.\n\nThe passengers will have four minutes of a feeling of weightlessness from the time the engines are cut off to the end of their free fall.\n\nVirgin Galactic's SpaceShip Two has wings that swivel to produce drag as it descends to Earth (Picture courtesy of Virgin Galactic)\n\nAre They Really Weightless?\n\nThe altitude at which suborbital flights like Branson’s and Bezos’ top off are not enough to be gravity-free. At a hundred kilometers above sea level, you have most of the gravitational acceleration still in effect (9.4 m/s2 vs 9.8 m/s2). The maneuver of pointing any craft straight up, cutting off power and free-falling is the time-tested method for simulating weightlessness used to train astronauts.\n\nFor a few minutes, the seatbelt sign goes off and Virgin Galactic passengers are free to float around the cabin.\n\nElon Musk’s trip to the International Space Station, which is four times higher, will let its space tourists get closer to being truly weightless and for much longer (more about that later)\n\nWhat Goes Up…\n\nThe spacecraft, which had been transported, ascending, then descending, its tricked-out wings swept back with upright winglets with stabilizers, undergoes a dramatic transformation. After the seatbelt light goes on, the winglets rotate 90 degrees about the beam of the spaceship, letting the surfaces that were once stabilizers produce maximum drag. Virgin Galactic calls this descent with drag “feathering.” The drag orients the spaceship level to the Earth and descends slower. The passengers will begin to feel more of the force of gravity during feathering, but buckled up and seated upright, they can enjoy the view from their window seat.\n\nThen the pilot rotates the wingtips of SpaceShip Two back into their original position to glide to a landing at Spaceport America, \"the world's first purpose-built commercial spaceport,\" in New Mexico. SpaceShip Two does an unconventional three-point landing using a ski where the nosewheel should be. It acts like a brake, says Virgin Galactic. Why not use a brake, we have to wonder?\n\nWings meant to feather Spaceship Two unlocked by mistake, killing one pilot and injuring another in a 2014 test flight. (Picture courtesy of Aviation Week and Space Technology)\n\nThe wings were activated by pilot error before feathering was needed in 2004. The sudden drag at Mach 0.92 mph ripped the spacecraft apart, killed one pilot. The other pilot parachuted down but sustained serious injury. After the crash, Virgin Galactic assured that safeguards would be put in place to prevent the wings from unlocking before feathering on subsequent missions.\n\nSpaceShipTwo’s Rocket Engine\n\nThe rocket engine used by Virgin Galactic is a bit unusual. It uses solid fuel. Virgin Galactic switched to a polyamide-based plastic fuel from previously used rubber-based hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, or HTPB. The engine uses nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidizer. Without the N2O the fuel does not fire, so cutting off the flow of N20 acts like an off switch. Normally, solid-fuel rockets cannot be turned off.\n\nTotal flight time: about 90 minutes. Cost: $250,000.\n\nBlue Origin – Jeff Bezos\n\nBlue Origin rocket and capsule. (Picture courtesy of Blue Origin) All window seats. Space for six tourists. The cylinder in the middle is holds a rocket engine used to free the capsule from the booster and provide the last puff before it meets the ground after descending on parachutes. (Picture courtesy of Blue Origin)\n\nBezos’s spacecraft is the New Shepard, its name coming from Alan Shepard, America’s first man in space.\n\nThe multistage rocket has an overall length of 18 m (60 ft) and a diameter of three to three and a half miles. It is fueled by liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and therefore, could be considered a green vehicle, its only exhaust byproduct being water.\n\nA conventional booster rocket follows a long tradition of manned rocket flights such as NASA’s. The civilian passengers of New Shepard will have to sit on a launch pad and sweat ignition and lift-off -- just like real astronauts.\n\nMurphy’s Law. Heard of It?\n\nBut perhaps the biggest difference between manned space missions by a government space agency and Blue Origin is that Blue Shepard will be the first fully autonomous spacecraft with humans aboard. Odd that full autonomy comes to Bezos’ space enterprise before it comes to his shopping service. Fully autonomy will allow tourists in space that would otherwise be denied, a concept Blue Shepard’s maiden voyage seemed eager to demonstrate with its first voyageurs, which included an 82-year old, a teenager and a businessman.\n\nWe found little about the autonomous space vehicles system onboard the Blue Shepard and are left with a big question. No pilot or astronaut onboard may be fine for suborbital, 11- minute flights when everything goes according to plan – but what if it doesn’t? When engineers consider all that can go wrong, worst-case scenarios, they design redundant systems, plan escape routes, overdesign, do endless simulations, play what-if games with each other and with themselves during sleepless nights… and still depend on the final fail-safe, a well-trained human being that has memorized every procedure, been tested to stay cool under pressure and observed to be resourceful. Some of the best AI on Earth, such as that used on AV systems, is still glitchy and can fail -- fatally. In space, the ill-fated Apollo 13, which suffered an explosion of its oxygen tanks on the way to the moon, was lucky to have veteran astronaut Jim Lovell on board to bring his entire crew of three home unscathed, after a multitude of improvisations, including using the LEM for life support and duct-taping CO2-scrubbing filters to the air supply so they wouldn’t all die from asphyxiation. With freezing fingers, astronauts wrote down page after page of emergency instruction from ground control. Sleep starved, they were able to perform critical calculations to correct their trajectory. Throughout their ordeal, expertly documented in Lovell’s book initially called Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 then shortened to just Apollo 13, there was no panic and not a single swear word was uttered.\n\nThe Blue Origin Rocket\n\nThe traditional manned space flight makes use of one-shot hardware, all of it unusable after a single-use, all very wasteful. The Blue Origin rocket is designed to be used multiple times, falling back to Earth gently under parachutes. Some of the rocket boosters have already been used as many as seven times during tests. Reusing hardware will certainly decrease the cost of space tourism over single-use hardware but we expect the Virgin Galactic concept of a jet-powered carrier plane and winged, gliding spaceship to withstand much more reuse and consequently, make space tourism much less expensive than the pure rocket approaches of Blue Origin and SpaceX.\n\nBlue Origin’s rocket launch will be able to punch its passengers higher than Virgin Galactic’s. The capsule will be released from the booster at a speed of about Mach 3 and continues its ascent until its apogee of 106 km above sea level. Did we mention that Blue Origin will go past the Kármán Line?\n\nAfter the capsule is separated from the booster, the booster drops down to Earth-like an arrow that refuses to turn, its vertical position assured by “wedge fins” and air brakes, surfaces that are lifted from the top of the rocket to create the drag, then, at the last moment, further slowed down by a blast from its rocket engine, which has saved just a bit of fuel for this purpose.\n\nBlue Origin capsule returns to Earth on parachutes.

        "content": "Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket launches on its debut flight from Florida on Jan. 15, 2025.\n\nA NASA Mars mission's long and winding road to the launch pad is nearing its end.\n\nThe twin ESCAPADE (Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers) Mars probes had been scheduled to launch last October, on the first-ever flight of Blue Origin's huge, partially reusable New Glenn rocket.\n\nBut NASA took the two spacecraft off that flight in September, citing the possibility of a cost-increasing launch delay. That delay did in fact come to pass; New Glenn ended up debuting on Jan. 15, successfully carrying a test version of Blue Origin's Blue Ring spacecraft platform to Earth orbit. The company aimed to land New Glenn's first stage on a ship at sea as well but failed in the attempt.\n\nThe ESCAPADE mission, meanwhile, continued in its state of limbo, without a publicly announced launch date.\n\nBut that has now been cleared up. On Thursday (July 17), Blue Origin announced that ESCAPADE will launch the second-ever flight of New Glenn, which is targeted for no earlier than Aug. 15 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nThat's later than the company had originally planned; Blue Origin had been eyeing late spring for the flight, known as NG-2, but pushed it back last month.\n\n\"This will be an exciting mission for New Glenn and Mars exploration. ESCAPADE is not only New Glenn’s first interplanetary mission, it’s also the first multi-spacecraft orbital science mission to study the Martian magnetosphere. And, we hope to land and recover our booster for the first time. Mars, here we come. Thank you to @NASA for riding with us to space,\" Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp said via X on Thursday.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nESCAPADE won't be the only payload flying on NG-2; the 320-foot-tall (98 meters) New Glenn will also carry a technology demonstration for satellite-communications company Viasat, according to Blue Origin.\n\nNASA's ESCAPADE (Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers) mission consists of two identical probes designed to study Mars' atmosphere and magnetosphere. (Image credit: NASA/Kim Shiflett)\n\nThe two ESCAPADE probes were built by California-based company Rocket Lab. They're known as Blue and Gold, the colors of the University of California, Berkeley, whose Space Sciences Laboratory will manage the $80 million mission for NASA.\n\nThat mission \"will analyze how Mars’ magnetic field guides particle flows around the planet, how energy and momentum are transported from the solar wind through the magnetosphere, and what processes control the flow of energy and matter into and out of the Martian atmosphere,\" NASA wrote in a description of ESCAPADE.\n\n\"The observations will reveal the planet’s real-time response to space weather and how the Martian magnetosphere changes over time,\" they added.",

        "content": "Crypto billionaire and Tron TRX/USD founder Justin Sun will soon be headed to space, taking his place on an upcoming Blue Origin spaceflight after his winning bid in 2021.\n\nWhat Happened: Sun is the latest big name to head to space aboard a Blue Origin spaceflight, following an all-female crew earlier this year that included Jeff Bezos' then fiancée Lauren Sánchez, media personality Gayle King and singer Katy Perry.\n\n\"In 2021, I bid $28M for a seat on @BlueOrign's New Shepard rocket — funds that went to @clubforfuture, Blue Origin's foundation, to support 19 space-based charities inspiring the next generation of STEM leaders. Proud to join Blue Origin's NS-34 mission and continue encouraging youth to pursue their dreams in science and space!\" Sun tweeted.\n\nBlue Origin's NS-34 marks its 14th human flight for the New Shepard program and 34th overall mission. The company, which was founded by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, has flown 70 people above the Karman line, which is the internationally recognized space boundary.\n\nA date for the space flight with Sun will be announced soon.\n\nAlso featured as part of the space crew are:\n\nArvinder (Arvi) Singh Bahal : real estate investor\n\n: real estate investor Gökhan Erdem : Turkish businessman\n\n: Turkish businessman Deborah Martorell: Puerto Rican meteorologist and journalist\n\nPuerto Rican meteorologist and journalist Lionel Pitchford : Englishman who enjoys traveling the world\n\n: Englishman who enjoys traveling the world James (J.D.) Russell: serial entrepreneur, founder Alpha Funds, founder Alpha Aerospace\n\nThis marks the second Blue Origin space flight for Russell, who was also part of the crew for NS-28.\n\nRead Also: Jeff Bezos Wants To Send You To Space After Katy Perry: Here’s How Much A Reservation With Blue Origin Costs\n\nWhy It's Important: Sun was the winner of a bid for the first seat on New Shepard back in 2021, but has yet to go to space.\n\nThe $28 million in proceeds were donated to Club for the Future, which picked 19 space-related nonprofits that each received a $1 million grant.\n\nSun has made headlines in the crypto sector in recent months. He was invited to a dinner with President Donald Trump as one of the top holders of the Trump Coin TRUMP/USD and is also an investor in World Liberty Financial, a crypto-related company with ties to the president's family.\n\nThe SEC paused an investigation into Sun and his companies for market manipulation earlier this year, which came after the investments in Trump-related cryptocurrency ventures. The SEC pause may also be what was needed to get Sun to space finally after winning his bid back in 2021.\n\nThis marks the fifth human spaceflight for Blue Origin in 2025. Among the bigger names to fly to space with Blue Origin along with pop singer Perry include Bezos himself, William Shatner, Michael Strahan and Dude Perfect’s Coby Cotton.\n\nBlue Origin reservations are open to anyone 18 years or older by filling out some information, including a description of yourself in less than 500 characters.\n\nThe one missing detail in the reservation is the total price involved for an unforgettable “Window seat” to space. The reservation form says a $150,000 fully, refundable deposit is collected by Blue Origin after booking a reservation.\n\nThis means the space flight with Blue Origin is more than $150,000. Virgin Galactic Holdings SPCE, which is currently in a pause of taking humans to space, has charged between $200,000 to $450,000 per person for past space flights.\n\nVirgin Galactic is expected to begin taking people to space again in 2026 as long as it passes required tests and its plan stays on track. Previous reservation holders for flights with Virgin Galactic included Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Bieber and Elon Musk.\n\nLoading...

        "content": "Nine days after being upstaged by Richard Branson, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is finally ready for his own flight into history, blasting off Tuesday morning aboard a fully automated spacecraft he believes will usher in a new era of commercial passenger service.\n\nReaching a slightly higher altitude than Branson's winged spaceplane, Bezos' New Shepard capsule is equipped with the largest windows ever built into a spacecraft, offering its briefly weightless passengers truly out-of-this-world views of planet Earth more than 62 miles below.\n\nMore important for the safety-conscious, perhaps, the capsule features a flight-tested abort system designed to quickly propel the ship and its passengers away from a malfunctioning booster.\n\nBlue Origin's New Shepard rocket and crew capsule blast off from the company's West Texas launch site for an unpiloted test flight. Tuesday's launch with company founder Jeff Bezos and three crewmates will be its first flight with people on board. Blue Origin\n\nLike Branson before him, Bezos' presence aboard his New Shepard spacecraft is a public show of confidence in its readiness, after 15 successful but unpiloted test flights, to begin sub-orbital flights for wealthy space tourists and researchers flying at government or corporate expense.\n\n\"I'm excited,\" Bezos said Monday in an interview with Gayle King on \"CBS This Morning.\" \"People keep asking if I'm nervous. I'm not really nervous, I'm excited. I'm curious. I want to know what we're going to learn.\"\n\n\"You're not nervous?\" King asked. \"How are you not nervous?\"\n\n\"We've been training, this vehicle is ready, this crew is ready, this team is amazing,\" Bezos replied. \"We just feel really good about it.\"\n\nHow to watch the Blue Origin space launch\n\nWhat: Jeff Bezos and three crewmates launch aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft\n\nJeff Bezos and three crewmates launch aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft Date: Tuesday, July 20, 2021\n\nTuesday, July 20, 2021 Time: Liftoff currently targeted for 9 a.m. EDT\n\nLiftoff currently targeted for 9 a.m. EDT Location: Blue Origin's Launch Site One, in the desert near Van Horn, Texas\n\nBlue Origin's Launch Site One, in the desert near Van Horn, Texas On TV: Watch CBS News Special Report coverage on your local CBS station — coverage begins at 8:53 a.m. EDT\n\nWatch CBS News Special Report coverage on your local CBS station — coverage begins at 8:53 a.m. EDT Online stream: Watch live on CBSN on your mobile or streaming device — coverage begins at 8:15 a.m. EDT\n\nBranson might have been the first owner-operator to ride into space aboard his own rocketplane, but Bezos, through his company Blue Origin, is committed to a much loftier ambition: building a commercial empire across all major sectors of the space economy.\n\nNot content to compete in the sub-orbital arena alone, Bezos also is challenging fellow billionaire and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, spending billions to fund development of more powerful New Glenn rockets to launch satellites and eventually people to Earth orbit and beyond.\n\n\"When it comes to space, I see it as my job,\" he said during the 2016 Code Conference. \"I'm building infrastructure the hard way, I'm using my resources to put in place heavy lifting infrastructure so that the next generation of people can have a dynamic, entrepreneurial explosion into space.\n\n\"I want thousands of entrepreneurs doing amazing things in space. And to do that, we have to dramatically lower the cost of access to space.\"\n\nBezos poses in front of his New Shepard booster, a reusable hydrogen-fueled rocket designed to boost the company's commercial crew capsule out of the discernible atmosphere for a brief sub-orbital trip to space. Blue Origin\n\nAs for risking his life for a 10-minute trip to space and back?\n\n\"You could argue about how risky it is if it's done right,\" Bezos said in a 2019 interview with Norah O'Donnell, anchor and managing editor of the CBS Evening News.\n\n\"With the technologies we have today, the suborbital mission could be made very safe. It can never be risk-free. The only thing that's really risk-free is staying in your bedroom.\"\n\nBut, he went on, \"we take risks when we think it's worth it to us, when it's an experience you want to have, whether it's horseback riding or scuba diving or any of the many things that people take some risk for. So the question is: Is that experience worth it to you? And for me, it certainly is.\"\n\nFor Bezos, possibly the richest man in the world with a net worth of some $200 billion, that dream will become reality Tuesday when he blasts off aboard his New Shepard rocket. Joining him on the flight are his brother Mark Bezos, the aviation pioneer Wally Funk and Dutch student Oliver Daemen, an 18-year-old space enthusiast who paid an undisclosed sum for his seat.\n\nFunk is a legendary professional pilot with more than 19,000 hours flying time who underwent grueling medical testing in the 1960s to prepare for spaceflight only to be barred from NASA's initially all-male astronaut corps by the Johnson administration.\n\n\"I didn't think that I would ever get to go up,\" Funk said in an Instagram video posted by Bezos. \"They said, 'Wally, you're a girl, you can't do that.' I said, guess what? Doesn't matter what you are, you can still do it if you want to. And I like to do things that nobody's ever done.\"\n\nWidely known and respected in aviation circles, Funk, at age 82, will be the oldest person to ever venture into space.\n\n\"But I feel like I'm 24!\" she told King on \"CBS This Morning.\"\n\nSaid Bezos: \"Wally can outrun all of us. In the Mercury 13 (medical checks), when they tested her she was better than all the men, and I can guarantee you that's still true today.\"\n\n\"I love being here,\" Funk added. \"This is the greatest team that I could ever be with, and it's gonna go, it's gonna happen. I've waited a long time, I've dreamt a long time to get to go up.\"\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum aboard the New Shepard is Daemen, who at 18 will be the youngest person to fly in space. He also will be Blue Origin's first paying passenger.\n\nDaemen is flying in place of an auction winner who bid $28 million for the seat only to opt out because of a schedule conflict. Blue Origin says the auction winner, who wants to remain anonymous, will take off on a later flight instead.\n\nDaemen's father Joes Daemen, founder of Somerset Capital Partners, participated in the auction but dropped out as the price soared to astronomical heights. Still, his bid apparently purchased a seat for his son, who was assigned a ride on Blue Origin's second commercial flight. The company moved him up to the July 20 flight when the winning bidder postponed.\n\n\"I am super excited to go to space and join them on the flight,\" Daemen said in a video posted on social media by a Dutch news site. \"I've been dreaming about this all my life.\"\n\nBranson won the commercial sub-orbital space race in 2018 when his company, Virgin Galactic, launched its first piloted test flight above 50 miles, the somewhat arbitrary \"boundary\" of space recognized by NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nWhile Branson's July 11 sub-orbital flight was Virgin's fourth carrying pilots, it was the first with a full six-person crew and the first with the company owner on board.\n\nBranson announced his flight after Bezos had already selected his July 20 launch date, blindsiding the Amazon founder and grabbing headlines in the high-stakes battle to sell a product — civilian spaceflight — as a for-profit enterprise.\n\n\"I truly believe that space belongs to all of us,\" Branson said before his flight. \"After more than 16 years of research, engineering and testing, Virgin Galactic stands at the vanguard of a new commercial space industry, which is set to open space to humankind and change the world for good.\"\n\nHe said he was \"honored to help validate the journey our future astronauts will undertake and ensure we deliver the unique customer experience people expect from Virgin.\"\n\nBezos had no public comment on Virgin's sudden decision to schedule Branson's flight ahead of Blue Origin's. But Branson insisted he didn't view the competition as a \"race.\"\n\n\"I've said this so many times, it really wasn't a race,\" he said after landing. \"We're just delighted that everything went so fantastically well. We wish Jeff the absolute best and the people (who) are going up with him during his flight.\"\n\nBlue Origin, in its mission statement, also denies being in a race and vows to pursue its goal of \"building a road to space\" according to its Latin motto, Gradatim Ferociter: \"Step by step, ferociously.\"\n\nBlue Origin's flight plan\n\nInnovation takes many forms, and Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin chose very different routes to space.\n\nUnlike Virgin Galactic's VSS Unity spaceplane, which is launched from a carrier jet and glides to a runway landing after a brief visit to the lower edge of space, Blue Origin's New Shepard is a much more traditional rocket and capsule.\n\nIn a little more than two minutes, the single-stage booster will propel the capsule and its crew straight up to an altitude of about 32 miles and a velocity of some 2,200 mph before main engine shutdown.\n\nLess than 30 seconds later, at an altitude of about 45 miles, the crew capsule will be released to fly on its own.\n\nWhile the reusable booster heads back to landing on a nearby pad, the crew capsule will continue upward on an unpowered, ballistic trajectory, reaching a maximum altitude of just above 62 miles three-and-a-half minutes after takeoff.\n\nThe Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), an international body based in Switzerland that certifies aerospace records, considers an altitude of 100 kilometers, or 62 miles — a level known as the Kármán Line — as the dividing line between the discernible atmosphere and space.\n\nVirgin Galactic's spaceplane flies just above 50 miles, meeting the NASA and FAA standard for spaceflight but not the FAI's. Blue Origin's capsule exceeds both altitudes — a distinction the company does not hesitate to point out.\n\n\"Only 4% of the world recognizes a lower limit of 80 km or 50 miles as the beginning of space,\" Blue Origin, referring to the U.S. agencies, tweeted two days before Branson's flight. \"New Shepard flies above both boundaries. One of the many benefits of flying with Blue Origin.\"\n\nOnly 4% of the world recognizes a lower limit of 80 km or 50 miles as the beginning of space. New Shepard flies above both boundaries. One of the many benefits of flying with Blue Origin. pic.twitter.com/4EAzMfCmYT — Blue Origin (@blueorigin) July 9, 2021\n\nApproaching the top of the trajectory, Bezos and his crewmates will experience about three minutes of weightlessness, enough time to unstrap and float about the cabin while enjoying spectacular views of Earth through six windows more than a three feet tall and nearly two-and-a-half feet wide.\n\nBlue Origin's New Shepard crew capsule features six seats and the largest windows ever built into a spacecraft. Blue Origin\n\nThen, plunging back into the lower atmosphere, the capsule will rapidly decelerate, subjecting the passengers to about four times the normal force of gravity, before three large parachutes unfurl, lowering the craft to a gentle touchdown a few miles from the launch pad.\n\nFrom liftoff to landing, the entire flight lasts about 10 minutes.\n\nIt's not yet known how much Blue Origin will charge for the short ride to space, but tickets are expected to run higher than $200,000, or more than $20,000 per minute of flight.\n\nWhatever the actual number, that astronomical cost has triggered harsh criticism in some quarters.\n\n\"Jeff Bezos' 11-minute thrill ride to space is an insult to the millions of people here on planet Earth who struggle every day to feed their families and make ends meet,\" Oxfam America said in a statement. \"Many of them are the very Amazon workers who helped make Bezos the richest man in the world.\"\n\nBoth companies believe economies of scale will eventually drive prices down. Along with wealthy thrill-seekers, Virgin and Blue Origin expect to fly U.S. and international astronauts, civilian and government researchers and microgravity experiments.\n\nBut it's an open question whether the market can sustain two companies over the long haul or whether either could withstand the impact should a catastrophic failure occur.",

        "content": "An international crew of four men and two women blasted off and rocketed to the edge of space Saturday, enjoying a few minutes of weightlessness and an out-of-this-world view before plunging back to Earth to wrap up Blue Origin's twelfth New Shepard passenger flight.\n\n\"It was such an incredible ride, very moving, very spiritual,\" Panamanian attorney Jaime Alemán, a former ambassador to the United States, said after landing. \"Even better than I ever imagined. I've been traveling, thanks to the gods, all my life, this was like the cherry on top of a cake. I mean, to go up in space and see how huge it is, you can only begin to imagine how much more there is still to discover.\"\n\nhe New Shepard rocket and crew capsule climb away from Blue Origin's West Texas launch site on the company's 12th crewed sub-orbital space flight. Blue Origin webcast\n\nBlue Origin's hydrogen-fueled single-stage booster roared to life at 9:39 a.m. EDT and quickly climbed away from the company's West Texas launch site, accelerating to just over 2,000 mph before releasing the New Shepard spacecraft.\n\nThe crew capsule, equipped with the largest windows of any operational spaceship, continued coasting up to an altitude of nearly 65 miles, just above the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space, before beginning the descent to landing.\n\nAt the moment the capsule was released, its three American passengers — Aymette Medina Jorge, Gretchen Green and Paul Jeris — along with Alemán, Canadian Jesse Williams and New Zealand's Mark Rocket, began enjoying about three minutes of weightlessness as they coasted upwards.\n\nThe New Shepard single-stage rocket flew itself back to landing near its launch pad for refurbishment and work to ready the vehicle for its next flight. Blue Origin webcast\n\nThe reusable New Shepard booster, meanwhile, also continued upward before slowing and beginning its on tail-first descent. Seven minutes after liftoff, the rocket's BE-3 engine re-ignited, four landing legs deployed and the booster settled to a picture-perfect touchdown on a landing pad near the launch site.\n\nThe gumdrop-shaped New Shepard capsule took a more leisurely flight home, descending under three large parachutes to touchdown in the West Texas desert 10 minutes after liftoff.\n\n\"You guys, we did it!\" one of the passengers exclaimed.\n\nPassenger Gretchen Green celebrates her trip to space after touchdown in the West Texas desert. Blue Origin webcast\n\nBlue Origin has now launched 12 passenger flights since the sub-orbital spacecraft carried Amazon- and Blue Origin-founder Jeff Bezos and three others aloft in July 2021. The company has now launched 68 passengers, including four who have flown twice.\n\nBlue Origin and its passengers do not reveal how much it costs to fly aboard a New Shepard, but it's estimated to cost upwards of $500,000 per seat. Jorge's seat was sponsored by Farmacias Similares, a Mexican company focused on accessible healthcare across Latin America. Her crewmates presumably paid for their own tickets.\n\nBlue Origin has had the sub-orbital passenger market to itself since June 2024 when competitor Virgin Galactic, founded by entrepreneur Richard Branson, retired its original rocketplane to focus on building two upgraded Delta-class spacecraft. Virgin is expected to resume flights next year.",

The capsule returned to Earth with the help of three giant parachutes.\n\nSunday's mission was the 13th human flight for the company’s New Shepard program and the 33rd since Blue Origin was started in 2000 by Bezos, the 61-year-old billionaire founder of Amazon.\n\nSeventy humans have now flown to space on Blue Origin since the company's first human flight in July 2021, according to the company.\n\nABC News' Matthew Glasser contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Justin Sun may finally be able to journey into space four years after he paid $28 million for a ticket, after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paused its lawsuit against him.\n\nSun has avoided the US for years after the SEC accused him of washtrading and selling unregistered securities in 2023.\n\nThe fear of arrest reportedly spooked him from returning to the country, even causing him to miss Donald Trump’s inauguration.\n\nFortunately for Sun, however, his SEC case has been “stayed” after he made numerous multi-million dollar investments into Trump’s crypto ventures.\n\nThis means that, as things stand, the controversial crypto billionaire is off to space later this year as part of Jeff Bezos’ ozone-depleting spaceflight program, Blue Origin.\n\nHe teased the flight in an X post made in May, writing, “Hello @BlueOrigin 👋Big things coming? I’m excited!”\n\n🚀 Meet the New Shepard NS-34 crew: Arvi Bahal, Gökhan Erdem, Deborah Martorell, Lionel Pitchford, J.D. Russell, and H.E. Justin Sun.

        "content": "Blue Origin, the space travel company owned by Jeff Bezos, has been taking passengers up to space since 2021 — but its latest trip didn't resonate with everyone.\n\nOn April 14, Blue Origin launched its most recent flight, NS-31, which made headlines with its all-female flight crew.\n\nThe rocket had six passengers: singer Katy Perry, broadcast journalist Gayle King, philanthropist Lauren Sánchez (the fiancée of Bezos), former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, bioastronautics research scientist Amanda Nguyen and film producer Kerianne Flynn.\n\nThe voyage lasted under 11 minutes total, as the rocket traveled up to the edge of space before returning to Earth. While the trip wasn't the first of its kind, it sparked different reactions with celebrities speaking out about its cost and the privatization of space travel.\n\nAt a press conference following their landing, PEOPLE asked King about the reaction to the Blue Origin mission. The CBS Mornings co-host said, “Anybody that’s criticizing it doesn’t really understand what is happening here.”\n\nSo why is the latest Blue Origin flight facing backlash? Here's everything to know about the mission and what the crew members have said in response to the criticism.\n\nWhat is Blue Origin?\n\nMichael Strahan exits the crew capsule after a successful mission to space and back and is greeted by Jeff Bezos. Blue Origin/ZUMA Press Wire Service/Shutterstock\n\nBlue Origin flights are space tourism, aiming to give more people the opportunity to travel high above the Earth's surface.\n\n\"We’re building a road to space for the benefit of Earth,\" reads the mission statement on the company's website. Other objectives include \"radically reduce the cost of access to space\" and \"harness the vast resources of space.\"\n\nThe April 14 flight was the 11th human space mission for Blue Origin and their 31st overall. The previous manned launch was on Feb. 25. According to its website, the company has \"flown 58 people to space, including four people who have flown twice.\"\n\nBlue Origin has not disclosed how much a seat on its rocket costs, but in order to begin the process of making a reservation, its website states that they require a \"fully refundable deposit\" of $150,000.\n\nBefore the April 14 trip, other celebrities who have traveled to space on a Blue Origin flight include Star Trek alum William Shatner and Good Morning America co-anchor Michael Strahan.\n\nWho was on the latest Blue Origin flight?\n\nEntrepreneur Lauren Sánchez, former NASA scientist Amanda Nguyen, singer Katy Perry, TV presenter Gayle King, former NASA scientist Aisha Bowe and film producer Kerianne Flynn posing in their space suits ahead of the all-woman sub-orbital mission aboard the New Shepard rocket. @nicolasgerardin/X ACCOUNT OF BLUE ORIGIN/AFP via Getty\n\nThe most recent Blue Origin flight occurred on April 14 and had an all-female crew of six.\n\nThe passengers included pop superstar Katy Perry, CBS Mornings co-host Gayle King and philanthropist Lauren Sánchez.\n\nThe other three members aboard were former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, bioastronautics research scientist Amanda Nguyen and film producer Kerianne Flynn.\n\n\n\n\"I have wanted to go to space for almost 20 years. I was investigating all of the possible commercial options,\" Perry told Elle ahead of the flight. \"Even when Blue Origin was first talking about commercial travel to space, I was like, 'Sign me up! I’m first in line.' \"\n\nFlynn echoed a similar sentiment, saying, \"When this opportunity came along, especially to be part of a historic all-female crew, I felt honored and excited.\"\n\n\"I can’t wait to touch down on Earth and share what we bring back with the world,\" she added.\n\nWhy are celebrities criticizing Blue Origin?\n\nOlivia Munn at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' 14th Annual Governors Awards on January 9, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. ; Emily Ratajkowski at Radio City Music Hall on February 14, 2025 in New York. ; Olivia Wilde attends the premiere of \"The Studio\" on March 24, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty ; Jamie McCarthy/Peacock via Getty ; Rodin Eckenroth/FilmMagic\n\nEven before the launch of Blue Origin flight NS-31, notable figures criticized the mission for several reasons, pointing to how it privatizes space travel and the alleged environmental impact.\n\nWhile co-hosting the April 3 taping of Today with Jenna and Friends, actress Olivia Munn questioned the trip's purpose. “What’s the point? Is it historic that you guys are going on a ride?\" she said. \"I think it’s a bit gluttonous.\"\n\nMunn continued, “Space exploration was to further our knowledge and to help mankind. What are they gonna do up there that has made it better for us down here?”\n\nOther celebrities who have spoken out include Emily Ratajkowski, Olivia Wilde, Amy Schumer, and even the fast-food chain Wendy's.\n\nJessica Chastain also joined the critics. On April 17, the Oscar-winning actress shared an op-ed from The Guardian on X, titled, \"The Blue Origin flight showcased the utter defeat of American feminism.\"\n\n\n\nHow did the Blue Origin crew members respond?\n\nLauren Sánchez, Katy Perry, Gayle King and others prepare to go to space in a Blue Origin flight. Cover Images via AP Images\n\nAt a press conference following their return to Earth, the Blue Origin crew addressed the comments made about their voyage.\n\n“We can all speak to the response we're getting from young women from young girls about what this represents,\" King said.\n\nSanchez added, “I get really fired up about this. I would love to have them come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees that don't just work here but they put their heart and soul into this vehicle. They love their work and they love the mission, and it's a big deal for them.\"\n\nBeing a former NASA rocket scientist, Bowe chose to focus on how the mission helped space research.\n\n\"We advanced science today,\" she explained. \"More people are going to be able to do meaningful research with Blue Origin because we collected data. ... We contributed to the knowledge base of what people know about women. ... We are inspiring the world right now.\"\n\nIn an interview with Extra, King commented, \"I know there are some haters, but I'm not going to let people steal my joy, and steal the joy of what we did or what we accomplished that day. I'm just not going to let it in.\"",

        "content": "At the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, our work has always been guided by a bold mission: to help build a better future for everyone. From the start, we cast a wide net to better understand where our resources and expertise could make the greatest impact.\n\nOver the years, we’ve learned a great deal about where we’re uniquely positioned to help. I’m proud of all of it. We took bold bets, worked alongside incredible partners, and learned where we could be most effective — and where others might be better suited to lead. That journey has led us to sharpen our focus on the intersection of biology and AI, where we’re seeing transformative momentum, while still committing meaningful resources to education and to our local community.\n\nFor me, this next science-focused chapter is deeply personal. I was the first in my family to go to college. I studied biology and spent a year teaching elementary school science before going to medical school. I worked as a trainee and pediatrician at UCSF and San Francisco General for eight years. It was there that I saw the limits of medicine and science up close, working with children with rare diseases. For those families, expanding the limits of what we know — advancing basic science research — is their only hope for a better life for their child.\n\nThose experiences shaped not just who I am, but what I believe is possible. And, it informed our mission in science — to help cure, prevent, and manage all disease by the end of this century. This work is already producing results. From our Biohubs to our AI-powered models to the researchers using our tools to uncover new insights, we’re seeing real breakthroughs.\n\nThat doesn’t mean our other initiatives weren’t worthwhile. But over time, we’ve learned that trying to do everything makes it harder to deliver deep, lasting impact. We had to focus — not because our values or beliefs changed, but because we needed to decide where our resources and efforts could do the most good. I’m still guided by the same values I’ve lived by my entire life, and that I work every day to pass on to my daughters: optimism for a better future, hard work to make that future possible, and a deep commitment to helping others. The changes we’ve made at CZI will allow us to ensure our work does the most good and achieves the greatest possible impact.\n\nOver the past nine years, we’ve invested more than $7 billion to help communities thrive. Mark and I are proud of what we’ve accomplished — and excited about what’s ahead. With sharper focus, we can accelerate discovery and build the tools science needs to move faster, so that the children I worked with as a pediatrician can have that better life.\n\nBy working together, we hope to unlock the promise of AI in science even more rapidly. Here’s how we’re doing it.\n\nLearning To Speak Cell\n\nIf you’ve spent any time using AI, you probably know that large language models are prediction machines. Show them billions and billions of words, and they’ll figure out how to put sentences together, write a poem, or (my favorite) summarize the last season of “The Amazing Race.”\n\nUsing AI to understand biology means teaching models how to speak the language of cells. Every gene in your DNA is like a word. And by expressing those words in different ways, cells do different things inside your body — from destroying viruses to making your heart beat. For years, scientists — including here at CZI and our Biohubs — have been assembling massive databases, called cell atlases, that show which genes “talk” in different types of cells in many different animals, including ourselves.\n\nWe recently released our first AI model that can decipher that language. It’s called TranscriptFormer. If you feed it cell atlas data, TranscriptFormer can tell you what kinds of cells you’re looking at and whether they’re healthy or sick — and in cases where they are sick, it can tell you what those cells are doing to defend themselves.\n\nTranscriptFormer can figure all that out even if it’s never seen cellular data from that organism before. The model doesn’t know what a rhesus monkey is. But even without being told that it’s looking at data from a monkey cell atlas, the model can still tell the difference between a monkey’s liver cells and brain cells. This is useful for health research in predicting whether a finding in one type of species, like mice or monkeys, might translate to human cells before doing experiments in the lab.\n\nResearchers can use TranscriptFormer for free to learn more about the cells they’re studying and find new patterns in their gene expression. This model is an important step in our work to build virtual cells, which will help scientists understand and predict the language of biology like never before.\n\nWatching Cells in Motion\n\nWe can learn a lot by studying how cells express their genes. But progress in biology also depends on direct observation — using microscopes to watch how cells move and change in real time.\n\nOne of the big challenges here is understanding what we’re looking at. Researchers usually use fluorescent dyes to label different parts of the cell. The images look cool, but manually staining cells takes a long time, and the light used to activate the dyes can damage the cells.\n\nA research team at our San Francisco Biohub has been studying whether AI can improve the process, but a major challenge has been that most models don’t work well across different microscopes or cell types. Our team explored how to make “virtual” staining more adaptable, creating a kind of virtual microscope that can track individual cells without using any dyes. The result, which they just published, is Cytoland: a set of AI models that can identify organelles in the cell across many microscopes and cell types — without any dyes at all.\n\nVirtual staining has a lot of advantages, starting with the fact that it’s faster, cheaper, and easier than the manual process. Even more importantly, it doesn’t degrade the cells — which means we can watch them for longer periods of time, see how they divide and differentiate, and map whole networks of cells as they respond to disease.\n\nDeciphering the Immune System\n\nWhen we started the Biohub model almost 10 years ago, we put in place an Investigator program where creative scientists, engineers and technologists from across nine different universities are able to pursue bold, visionary ideas. Each of their projects aims to accelerate the pace of scientific discovery and help us realize our mission of curing, preventing and managing disease. We recently named nine Investigators from Columbia University, The Rockefeller University and Yale University to decipher the molecular language of immune cells, enabling these cells to be deployed for disease detection, prevention and treatment in a broad spectrum of age-related diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and aggressive cancers. I’m always inspired by our Investigators and look forward to seeing what they accomplish when given the freedom to explore something new in science.\n\nWith care,\n\nCo-Founder and Co-CEO\n\nChan Zuckerberg Initiative",

        "content": "Code to Cure is a newsletter co-hosted by the Wyss Institute at Harvard University and Milad Alucozai on the intersection of AI, biology, and healthcare transforming medicine.\n\nBy Milad Alucozai\n\nImagine a world where algorithms predict the next pandemic before it strikes, where you receive custom-designed treatments tailored to your individual genetic makeup, lifestyle, and medical history, and where scientists test new drugs and therapies on digital twins in simulated clinical trials, speeding up the development of life-saving treatments and reducing our reliance on traditional, time-consuming methods. We live in an age where the digital and physical boundaries are dissolving. We’re no longer just passively observing life through a microscope; we’re actively engineering it. This isn’t science fiction; it’s the groundbreaking reality of biology today, where we’re rewriting the very code of life itself. Powerful technologies converge, generating a tsunami of biological data—petabytes upon petabytes of intricate information. Universities, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, startups, and technology giants are racing to harness this data, equipping a new generation of researchers with the tools to decipher life’s deepest secrets and conquer its most daunting challenges.\n\nFrom I n Silico to In Vitro to In Vivo\n\nFrom the moment we step into a classroom, we’re subtly conditioned to see the world in distinct categories. Biology, engineering, public health – each subject occupies its own neatly labeled box, seemingly separate and distinct. We learn about cells and ecosystems in one class, circuits and algorithms in another, and epidemiology and healthcare systems in another. This compartmentalization, while perhaps helpful for organizing curricula, can obscure the deep and intricate connections that weave these disciplines together.\n\nTraditionally, the realms of computational biology and informatics, often referred to as the “in silico” domain, have operated as distinct disciplines from the myriad wet lab fields within the life sciences, which primarily revolve around experimentation using molecular biology tools, cell lines, microbial cultures, and biochemical assays, known as “in vitro” studies. These, in turn, stand apart from fields concentrating on research within animal models and clinical settings, termed “in vivo” investigations. This segregation reflects the diverse methodologies and emphases characteristic of each domain, with computational approaches emphasizing data analysis, modeling, and simulation. At the same time, wet lab experiments delve into biological phenomena through physical experimentation and observation.\n\nFrom the moment we step into a classroom, we’re subtly conditioned to see the world in distinct categories. This compartmentalization, while perhaps helpful for organizing curricula, can obscure the deep and intricate connections that weave these disciplines together. Milad Alucozai\n\nNevertheless, contemporary trends are blurring these traditional boundaries as interdisciplinary collaborations become increasingly prevalent. In the modern landscape of scientific inquiry, the delineation between in silico, in vitro, and in vivo is growing increasingly porous, with researchers recognizing the value of integrating diverse methodologies to tackle complex biological questions comprehensively. The research process is evolving into a more dynamic, iterative loop where hypothesis generation, hypothesis testing, results interpretation, and hypothesis refinement intertwine cyclically.\n\nThis iterative nature underscores the fluidity of scientific inquiry as researchers navigate between computational analyses, experimental validations, and clinical observations to refine their understanding of biological phenomena. As such, the once rigid divisions between computational and experimental approaches give way to a more holistic and synergistic approach to scientific discovery.\n\nBuilding Software for Science\n\nThe evolution of biological research is not solely confined to advancements within the laboratory setting. Parallel to the technological progress in experimental methodologies, significant strides have been made in software development, fundamentally altering the landscape of computational biology. These advancements encompass a wide range of areas, including:\n\nCode generation—Modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) offer features such as code linting for automated error checking and even code generation facilitated by large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing programming efficiency.\n\nSource Code Management — Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket promote collaborative software development and version control, streamlining the development process.\n\nSoftware packaging and delivery — Containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes simplify software deployment and management, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.\n\nCloud Computing— Cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure provide access to vast computational resources, enabling researchers to perform complex analyses without substantial hardware investments.\n\nTesting — Continuous Integration and Continuous Development (CI/CD) pipelines automate software testing and deployment, ensuring software quality and reliability.\n\nProject management — Agile and Scrum methodologies, often facilitated by tools like Jira, enhance project organization and efficiency.\n\nThese advancements have profound implications for the scientific discovery process. The development of specialized software tools tailored for scientific applications reduces the barrier to entry for researchers, enabling effective utilization of computational methods without requiring extensive programming expertise. This democratization of computational resources fosters a convergence of traditionally distinct research domains.\n\nConsequently, the conventional boundaries delineating in silico, in vitro, and in vivo studies are becoming increasingly porous. Laboratories are transitioning from isolated entities to interdisciplinary hubs, seamlessly integrating various methodologies. This collaborative environment, facilitated by accessible computational tools, accelerates scientific progress. Furthermore, incorporating ML algorithms within this framework empowers researchers to optimize their workflows, expedite data analysis, and accelerate extracting meaningful insights.\n\nThe Role of ML in Discovery: Hypothesis Generation vs. Hypothesis Testing\n\nMachine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for generating hypotheses in biological research. By identifying patterns and trends within vast datasets, ML algorithms can predict outcomes and suggest potential avenues for investigation. This predictive capability is precious in complex fields like genomics, proteomics, and drug discovery, where researchers grapple with massive amounts of data. However, biological systems’ inherent variability and complexity often pose challenges for ML models. Even with extensive data, accurately predicting biological phenomena can be complicated due to many biological processes’ multitude of interacting factors and stochastic nature.\n\nTraditional laboratory-based hypothesis testing plays a crucial role. Experimental validation provides a critical reality check, grounding the predictions generated by ML models in empirical evidence. By carefully designing and conducting experiments, researchers can test the validity of ML-generated hypotheses and refine the models based on real-world observations. This iterative process of prediction and validation is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of ML models in biological research.\n\nUltimately, the synergy between ML and experimental validation drives scientific discovery. The iterative feedback loop, where ML models generate hypotheses and experiments provide validating evidence, allows for continuous refinement and a deeper understanding of complex biological systems. This dynamic interplay between computational prediction and empirical observation holds immense promise for accelerating breakthroughs in fields ranging from disease modeling and drug development to personalized medicine and synthetic biology.\n\nHorizontal & Vertical: Bridging the AI Gap\n\nThe world of AI in the life sciences is often divided into two distinct approaches: horizontal and vertical.

        "content": "Follow us on Google News (click on ☆)\n\nPROTEUS: a cellular evolution accelerator\n\nApplications: from gene editing to cancer detection\n\nGoing further: what is directed evolution?\n\nAustralian researchers have developed a form of biological artificial intelligence, a system capable of accelerating molecular evolution directly within living cells. This breakthrough, named PROTEUS, opens unprecedented possibilities for personalized medicine and gene therapies.Unlike traditional methods limited to bacteria, PROTEUS operates in mammalian cells, reproducing in weeks a process that would take much longer in nature. This targeted \"evolution engine\" enables the design of custom molecules tailored to biological challenges.The system relies on directed evolution, a technique awarded a Nobel Prize in 2018. PROTEUS adopts this principle while overcoming the limitations of bacterial models. Mammalian cells provide an environment closer to humans, which is crucial for medical applications.To avoid biases, scientists used chimeric viral particles. This blend of two distinct viruses ensures system stability. The cells thus test millions of molecular variants, selecting the most effective ones.Results published inshow that PROTEUS can refine known biological mechanisms. For instance, it generated an improved version of the rtTA protein, increasing its sensitivity to a drug by a factor of 6. These optimizations demonstrate its potential for fine-tuning therapeutic tools.PROTEUS has already produced nanobodies capable of detecting DNA damage, a key cancer marker. A specific mutation (S26P) enhanced their precision in the cell nucleus, as revealed by tests with chemotherapeutic agents.The system could also improve CRISPR or mRNA vaccines. By adjusting therapeutic molecules directly in human cells, it avoids pitfalls of simplified models. Its open-source nature encourages widespread adoption by the scientific community.Researchers are now exploring its adaptation to other cell types. Ultimately, PROTEUS could enable targeting specific tissues or diseases, combining speed with physiological relevance.Directed evolution replicates in the laboratory the key mechanisms of natural selection - random mutations and selective pressure - but in an accelerated and targeted manner. Unlike natural evolution operating on geological timescales, this technique produces optimized biomolecules in just weeks. Researchers can thus \"evolve\" enzymes, antibodies or other proteins to give them specific properties.This approach was transformed by Frances Arnold's work, awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018. Her team demonstrated that protein evolution could be guided to obtain more stable or active industrial enzymes. Today, directed evolution is used to develop biofuels, eco-friendly detergents or more effective drugs.PROTEUS's major innovation lies in its application to mammalian cells, a far more complex environment than traditionally used bacteria. The system can thus produce molecules perfectly adapted to human biology. This breakthrough paves the way for more precise therapies and more reliable diagnostic tools.",

        "content": "CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — By combining artificial intelligence with automated robotics and synthetic biology, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have dramatically improved performance of two important industrial enzymes — and created a user-friendly, fast process to improve many more.\n\nLed by Huimin Zhao, a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the U. of I., the team reported its findings in the journal Nature Communications.\n\n“Enzymes have been increasingly used in energy production, in therapeutics, even in consumer products like laundry detergent. But they are not as widely used as they could be, because they still have limitations. Our technology can help address those limitations efficiently,” said Zhao, who also is affiliated with the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at the U. of I.\n\nEnzymes are proteins that carry out specific catalytic functions that drive many biological processes. Those seeking to harness enzymes to advance medicine, technology, energy or sustainability often run into roadblocks involving an enzyme’s efficiency or its ability to single out a desired target amidst a complex chemical environment, Zhao said.\n\n“Improving protein function, particularly enzyme function, is challenging because we don’t know exactly what kinds of mutations we should introduce — and it’s usually not just a single mutation; it’s a lot of synergistic mutations,” Zhao said. “With our model of integrating AI and automated synthetic biology, we offer an efficient way to solve that problem.”\n\nZhao’s group previously reported an AI model to predict an enzyme’s function based on its sequence. In the new paper, the researchers take their AI a step farther: predicting what changes to a known protein would improve its function.\n\n“In a typically sized enzyme, the possible number of variations is larger than the number of atoms in the universe,” said Nilmani Singh, the co-first author of the paper. “So we use the AI method to help us create a relatively small library of potentially useful variant combinations, instead of randomly searching the whole protein sequence.”\n\nHowever, training and improving an AI model is more than just code; it requires a lot of input, data and feedback. So the Illinois team coupled their AI models with the automated capabilities offered by the iBioFoundry, a center at the U. of I. dedicated to quick, user-friendly engineering and testing of biological systems ranging from enzymes to whole cells. Zhao directs the iBioFoundry, which is supported by the National Science Foundation.\n\nIn the new paper, the researchers lay out their process: First, they ask the AI tool how to improve a desired enzyme’s performance. The AI tool searches datasets of known enzyme structures and suggests sequence changes. The automated protein-building machines at the iBioFoundry produce the suggested enzymes, which are then rapidly tested to characterize their functions. The data from those tests are fed into another AI model, which uses the information to improve the next round of suggested protein designs.\n\n“It’s a step toward a self-driving lab: a lab that designs its own proteins, makes the proteins, tests them and makes the next one,” said Stephan Lane, the manager of the iBioFoundry and co-first author. “The designing and learning is done by an AI algorithm, and the building and testing is done by robotics.”\n\nUsing this method, the team produced variants of two key industrial enzymes with substantially improved performance. One enzyme, added to animal feed to improve its nutritional content, increased its activity by 26 times. The other, a catalyst used in industrial chemical synthesis, had 16 times greater activity and 90 times greater substrate preference, meaning it was far less likely to grab molecules that were not its target.\n\n“We described two enzymes in the paper, but it’s truly a generalized approach. We only need a protein sequence and an assay,” Zhao said. “We want to try to apply it to as many enzymes as possible.”\n\nNext, the researchers plan to continue improving their AI models and upgrade equipment for even faster, higher-throughput synthesis and testing. They also have developed a user interface, enabling the system to run with a simple typed query. Their aim is to offer their method as a service for other researchers seeking to improve enzymes and speed drug development and innovations in energy and technology.\n\n“For the user interface, the motivation is to allow people with different backgrounds to use the tool,” said graduate student Tianhao Yu, a coauthor of the paper. “If an experimental scientist doesn’t know how to run Python programs, then they can use our interface to help them run the program. They just need to use English to describe their needs, and it will automatically run.”\n\nThe National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy supported this work.",

        "content": "OpenAI’s newest product promises to make it easier for someone to automatically gather data, create spreadsheets, book travel, spin up slide decks—and, just maybe, build a biological weapon. ChatGPT Agent, a new agentic AI tool that can take action on a user’s behalf, is the first product OpenAI has classified as having a “high” capability for biorisk.\n\nThis means the model can provide meaningful assistance to “novice” actors and enable them to create known biological or chemical threats. The real-world implications of this could mean that biological or chemical terror events by non-state actors become more likely and frequent, according to OpenAI’s “Preparedness Framework,” which the company uses to track and prepare for new risks of severe harm from its frontier models.\n\n“Some might think that biorisk is not real, and models only provide information that could be found via search. That may have been true in 2024 but is definitely not true today. Based our evaluations and those of our experts, the risk is very real,” Boaz Barak, a member of the technical staff at OpenAI, said in a social media post.\n\n“While we can’t say for sure that this model can enable a novice to create severe biological harm, I believe it would have been deeply irresponsible to release this model without comprehensive mitigations such as the one we have put in place,” he added.\n\nOpenAI said that classing the model as high risk for bio-misuse was a “precautionary approach,” and one that had triggered extra safeguards for the tool.\n\nKeren Gu, a safety researcher at OpenAI, said that while the company did not have definitive evidence that the model could meaningfully guide a novice to create something of severe biological harm, it had activated safeguards nonetheless. These safeguards include having ChatGPT Agent refuse prompts that could potentially be intended to help someone produce a bioweapon, systems that flag potentially unsafe requests for expert review, strict rules that block risky content, quicker responses to problems, and robust monitoring for any signs of misuse.\n\nOne of the key challenges in mitigating the potential for biorisk is that the same capabilities could unlock life-saving medical breakthroughs, one of the big promises for advanced AI models.\n\nThe company has become increasingly concerned about the potential for model misuse in biological weapon development. In a blog post last month, OpenAI announced it was ramping up safety testing to reduce the risk of its models being used to aid in the creation of biological weapons. The AI lab warned that without these precautions, the models could soon enable “novice uplift”—helping individuals with little scientific background develop dangerous weapons.\n\n“Unlike Nuclear and Radiological threats, obtaining materials is less of a barrier for creating bio threats and hence security depends to greater extent on scarcity of knowledge and lab skills,” Barak said. “Based on our evaluations and external experts, an unmitigated ChatGPT Agent could narrow that knowledge gap and offer advice closer to a subject matter expert.”\n\nChatGPT Agent\n\nOpenAI’s new ChatGPT feature is an attempt to cash in on one of the buzziest, and most risky, areas of AI development: agents.\n\nThe new feature functions like a personal assistant, capable of handling tasks such as booking restaurant reservations, online shopping, and organizing job candidate lists. Unlike previous versions, the tool can use a virtual computer to actively control web browsers, interact with files, and navigate across apps like spreadsheets and slide decks.\n\nThe company merged the teams behind Operator, its first AI agent, and Deep Research, a tool developed to conduct multi-step online research for complex tasks, to form a single group that developed the new tool.\n\nAI labs are currently racing to build agents that can manage complex digital tasks independently, and the launch follows similar releases by Google and Anthropic. Big Tech companies see AI agents as a commercial opportunity, as companies are increasingly moving to implement AI into workflows and automate certain tasks.\n\nOpenAI has acknowledged that greater autonomy introduces more risk and is emphasizing user control to mitigate these risks. For example, the agent asks for permission before taking significant action and can be paused, redirected, or stopped by the user at any time.",

        "content": "The integration of AI techniques into synthetic biology workflows is set to accelerate the design, testing, and optimization of engineered biological constructs across multiple domains11. From pharmaceutical production to environmental remediation, AI-enabled automation and in silico modeling can shorten development timelines and expand the complexity of achievable biosystems. Early efforts to incorporate advanced digital capabilities such as LLMs and biological design tools (BDTs) foreshadow the near-term achievements of this convergence. Specifically, the non-trivial processing power of machine learning (ML), a data-driven subdiscipline of AI, will likely deliver rapid acquisition of complex, high-fidelity biological information, increasingly accurate sequence-to-structure prediction modeling, and improved design-build-test-learn cycle efficiency. These advances will also be the foundation for future digital biodesign that will someday be capable of rapid automated design and synthesis of novel biological constructs ranging from macromolecules to entire metabolisms. We can use prior advances in bioengineering as guideposts as we anticipate the future of AI-empowered synthetic biology.\n\nKnowledge acquisition and refinement\n\nThe last 50 years have seen remarkable gains in the acquisition and interpretation of sequence information. Early sequencing technologies, based on chain termination, required hours of work by highly skilled hands to deliver short segments of nucleic acid sequence. These efforts eventually gave rise to the era of high-throughput sequencing marked by the introduction of automated sequencing platforms and the application of computer processing, which delivered the assembly of the first long, contiguous sequences of DNA12. Further innovations led to the development of massively parallel sequencing techniques, commonly known as ‘next-generation’ sequencing. By 2008, the speed of DNA sequencing began to surpass Moore’s Law, a trend that continues today13.\n\nGrowing capability in sequencing empowered the human genome project as well as the delivery of multiple eukaryotic genomes in the early 2000s. The utilization of digital tools such as Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and microarray technologies encouraged the emerging fields of comparative -omics14. The success of the BLAST tools highlights how integral digital-based processing is to modern biological investigation. This early convergence of a digital tool that allowed faster examination and delivered insights into the structure of both coding and noncoding sequences foreshadows the success of powerful AI/ML tools that will deliver the next generation of biological fluency.\n\nToday, emerging single-molecule sequencing (SMS) capabilities are delivering improved cost, speed, and platform portability. SMS is also enabling a more detailed examination of sequences. The convergence of AI with SMS technology is generating increasingly complex data, including insights into modified base calling, sequence variant detection, and chromosome phasing15,16. These advances have already delivered in application areas such as medical diagnostics, epigenomic analysis and the improvement of reference genomes17,18,19. In the future, it is likely that ML will allow raw data to be curated and interpreted to an even greater extent at the point of original discovery.\n\nMolecular genetic studies have, piece by piece, revealed the intricate processes that control gene expression. The landmark identification and purification of the eukaryotic RNA polymerases in 1969, followed by decades of rigorous biochemical studies, revealed a staggeringly complex interplay between DNA sequence, chromatin structure, and the soluble factors that control the dynamic and responsive industry of eukaryotic gene expression. While impressive revelations regarding the paradigm of gene expression at large have been made, gaps in our ability to predict how both coding and non-coding genomic information deliver the dynamic living structures persist. As we continue to uncover the paradigms of genetic expression, including nucleic acid sequence structure, epigenetic structure, and other contextual effectors, our understanding of how biological function is recorded, stored, and altered will grow more sophisticated. Fulsome cognizance of how biological information is transformed into functionality is almost certainly unobtainable without the aid of the analytical power of AI. AI empowered analyses of the biological systems may themselves fall short of this immense task, but they will move us closer to mastery.\n\nTools like LLMs and BDTs, and future technologies that may broadly fit under the umbrella of AI, are beginning to help shape our understanding of genomic information. AI is being employed to progress our understanding of how genetic sequence becomes physical structure. Significant capability is emerging in DNA-based LLMs and BDTs that are capable of tasks such as gene finding, enhancer annotation, and chromatin accessibility prediction. Ultimately, this convergence will enhance human understanding of how biological structures are produced in a temporally and spatially coordinated manner to produce functional metabolisms.\n\nPredicting functionality\n\nBeginning with the publication of the central dogma, perhaps the birth of modern molecular genetics, molecular biology has pushed us towards a better understanding of how stored biological information is transformed into structural capability. With every gain, we seem to uncover a better but more daunting view of the intricate and sophisticated biochemistry that delivers the diversity of life on earth. In the section above, we discussed the emerging convergent technologies that will allow for extensive and precise readings of sequence, and it is important to note this activity as a foundation for what we will discuss in this section. The integration of huge volumes of genomic data into more than nonsensical letters has, for decades, been a burdensome task. Modern molecular biology has partially revealed the significance of non-coding sequences, epigenetics, and other contextual effectors of biological manifestation. Adept synthetic biological designers will require mastery over a polyfactorial system, which is not fully understood. AI/ML-supported knowledge acquisition will progress human understanding of the relationship between sequence, context, and structure.\n\nModern AI, including LLMs and BDTs, will be powerful tools in the deciphering of DNA data that will unquestionably improve our understanding of genomes and their design paradigms. AI is fueling advances across the biological sciences, from deciphering the rules of protein folding to optimizing chemical synthesis pathways20. AI, driven by state-of-the-art architectures like transformers and Hyena models, is emerging as an increasingly reliable tool for uncovering subtle, distant, and non-obvious implications of coding and non-coding sequence21. The work to decipher the meaning of genomic data is more challenging than similar work on protein sequence, hindered largely by a lack of well-curated and publicly available experimental data. This discrepancy is caused by the fact that protein sequence has already been extensively experimentally decoded, removing the myriad intricacies of expression, altering non-coding details that are abundant in genomic data. Put another way, the derivation of phenotype from DNA sequence will require a deeper understanding of a language that has been developed and refined via 4 billion years of the evolutionary process.\n\nProteins are the molecular workhorses of life, and the physical result of the central dogma. Protein function is derived from its exact physical embodiment. Understanding how a protein will play its metabolic role requires intricate awareness of its shape and charge to the atomic level, which influence the protein’s folding, stability, and interactions with other molecules, which are essential for its biological function. Empirically derived 3D protein structure has historically required laborious techniques such as X-ray crystallography that placed some proteins, including many membrane-bound proteins, out of reach for structural biologists. In the first decade of the 21st century, cryo-electron microscopy improved the plight of structural biologists by removing the need for crystallization prior to molecular interrogation22. It is still, however, a non-trivial task to identify the precise physical 3D structure of proteins.\n\nProtein engineering stands to benefit from AI23. One key area of focus has been the de novo design of proteins - creating novel protein sequences predicted to fold into desired shapes and functions. Recently, DeepMind’s AlphaFold has solved a 50-year-old challenge that has stumped the field by achieving improved accuracies at modeling protein tertiary structure for all known proteins simultaneously24. It is not surprising that in 2022, Nature Methods identified the AlphaFold2 protein structure prediction as the Method of the Year25. This computational leap forward approaches the level of accuracy of traditional empirical methods but does so for all known proteins simultaneously and delivers results with a significantly reduced time, cost, and labor burden26. AlphaFold2 has flexed its capability, predicting protein structure for all of the known human proteome27. Generative models such as Hyena28, or from companies like Absci and Orbit Discovery, use their in-house AI to propose novel protein sequences tailored for binding affinity, catalysis, signaling functions, and others. These AI techniques enhance rational protein engineering efforts and put in reach combinatorial spaces too vast for high-throughput screening. By exponentially accelerating the design proposal and selection, they stand to unlock novel biomolecules for applications from industrially useful enzymes to living therapeutics.\n\nAccelerating design cycles and automating DBTL\n\nGrueling, painstaking work gave rise to our first understanding of gene expression. The lac operon was explained by Nobel laureates: In 1969, Jacob and Monod29 began to uncover the machines responsible for eukaryotic gene expression. The first wave of foundational discoveries regarding nature’s control over transformation of information into physical structure have since been joined by a myriad of molecular mechanisms such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)30, the latter of which earned the authors the Nobel Prize in 2020. The foundational work in molecular genetics, while exciting, has also revealed the incomplete status of our understanding. That same insight revealed the daunting and complex challenge for the field of molecular biology. AI techniques, such as traditional machine learning algorithms and the more recently developed LLMs and BDTs, are beginning to assist us in answering that challenge. As science delivers a deeper understanding of how biological language is translated into physical structure, the toolkits of future synthetic biologists are being built.\n\nThe field of synthetic biology is approaching a tipping point driven by the application of ML31. Revolutionary ability to augment and automate computational steps in the design-build-test-learn pipeline will be delivered by AI32. For DNA design, neural network models may learn to optimize regulatory sequence and expression regimes for a desired biological context33. Sophisticated models can even propose entire genetic circuits for a specified outcome. Companies like Ansa Biotechnologies, TeselaGen, and Synthace offer such AI-guided DNA design and optimization services to clients engineering microbial strains or developing gene therapies. An entire industry of design optimization for the user of synthetic biological structures is emerging.\n\nEngineered CAR T-cells have shown effectiveness against some lymphomas34. These treatments are expensive, costing several hundred thousand dollars. This price point is a function of the effort required to design and implement the production of CAR proteins in the patient’s T-cells. Further, while these can be effective customized therapies, they continue to have major limitations, such as off-target toxicity35. As databases of CAR-T designs are built, researchers will begin to piece together a wider understanding of why certain constructs are effective. The application of ML to predict the quality of the complex interactions between CAR-T cells and their cancerous targets has been shown to track clinical outcomes for an existing CAR-T cell treatment. The continued application of ML and future AI systems with access to growing databases will feed the ability of AI to predict functionality, ultimately lowering the bar for delivering efficacious, financially obtainable, individualized therapies.\n\nBeyond construct design, AI can also automate and enhance downstream steps like molecular cloning, strain engineering, phenotypic assays, and data analytics. Robotics controlled by algorithms handle material transport, instrumentation control, colony picking, liquid handling, incubation, and chromatography. They can systematically build genetic variant libraries, perform multiplexed experiments, and characterize engineered cells with minimal human intervention. Startups like Biotium, Strateos, and Emerald Cloud Lab already leverage such capabilities, offering services like rapid microbial strain and enzyme optimization to clients. The automated build-test loops they orchestrate help engineer organisms for goals from biosensing to biomanufacturing.\n\nClosing the build-test loop, AI may be useful in digesting and learning from the resultant data. Beyond accelerating each individual step, algorithmic coordination also continually tunes the end-to-end pipeline. Performance metrics from assays and analytics further refine design parameters, DNA synthesis constraints, robotic workflows, and models themselves. BioAutomata, an automated robotic platform coupled with predictive ML, was able to demonstrate optimization of the lycopene production pathway. This example removes the human in the loop after initial query, returns a completed DBTL cycle, and delivers impressive optimization while testing less than 1% of variants8.\n\nConnecting AI analysis to automated empirical learning will allow rapid interrogation of synthetic design across a spectrum of cellular and multicellular contexts. While this will clearly reduce costs and labor input required to identify functional synthetic biological constructs, it is also worth noting that it reduces human access to empirical knowledge acquisition.\n\nEnabling novel biosystems\n\nBeyond sheer acceleration, AI integration can also expand the complexity frontiers of achievable biological systems. Tasks like controlling and interpreting multiplexed sensors, tuning multidimensional gene expression, or optimizing intricate metabolic pathways require assessing vast design spaces. Computational exploration of combinatorial and sequence spaces facilitates the rational design of multifaceted systems previously out of reach. For example, companies like Lycia Therapeutics and Nuvai leverage generative neural networks to engineer novel protein machines, signaling modulators, and smart enzyme cascades.\n\nSynthesizing such elaborate blueprints demands a fluency in biology’s design grammar—understanding how low-level DNA syntax translates to high-level systemic functions. Here, too, AI is proving adept at deducing underlying design rules. Whether by mining patterns in databases or learning sequence–structure–function mappings from laboratory data, algorithms uncover predictive models relating genotypes to phenotypes. In a feedback loop, experimentally validating model outputs also continually refines understanding of this grammar. The design of an optimized whole gene regulatory structure using a deep generative adversarial network can be used to drive regulatory control above traditional mutagenesis methods. Startups like Design-by-Data and Flatcarbon leverage such learned design principles for forward engineering of microbes, yeast, or cell lines to specification.\n\nAs algorithms are engineered for improved interpretability of genetic information at a biological system level, they can assist bioengineers in consciously composing increasingly sophisticated systems for sensing, manufacturing, remediation, and medical needs. Rather than just troubleshooting known designs via discriminative models, these AI systems will become generative partners, enabling more expansive and reliable creation. Ultimately, AI will deliver a next-generation artificial biodesigner. An AI biodesigner will require a more sophisticated ability to apply the polyfactorial contextual effectors that lie between nucleotide structure and biological function to the task of bioengineering. The advent of this AI biodesigner will be a leap forward from the current discriminative assistance that is currently in use. Progress towards a capable AI biodesigner must be accompanied by human knowledge capture, critical for both installing appropriate interrogation sites and controls on next-generation biotechnical AI models.\n\nIncreased access and reducing skill threshold\n\nThe convergence of AI and synthetic biology is poised to dramatically lower the skill threshold, allowing access to and participation in the bioengineering landscape9. By automating routine molecular biology tasks and providing intuitive design tools, AI lowers the barriers to entry and de-skills many routine technical tasks for a wider range of interested actors. Traditionally, the field has been restricted to highly skilled experts with extensive hands-on experience in molecular biology techniques. However, the integration of AI is now enabling computer scientists, entrepreneurs, and even biohackers to engage in bioengineering projects with minimal wet lab backgrounds.\n\nOne key way AI facilitates this democratization is by handling repetitive workflows and providing user-friendly interfaces. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) abstract away the complexities of command-line programming, allowing those without coding expertise to still leverage advanced models. Startups like Strateos and Emerald Cloud Lab take this a step further, offering remote access to robotic instrumentation for automated experimentation. This means even freelance bioentrepreneurs can prototype ideas without the need for costly in-house lab infrastructure.\n\nMoreover, as AI models grow increasingly sophisticated, they are beginning to encapsulate the domain knowledge and decision-making capabilities that were once the exclusive purview of seasoned researchers. By codifying the heuristics and intuition of human experts into algorithmic routines, AI is progressively deskilling certain aspects of the bioengineering process. In the near future, AI assistants may provide personalized guidance and support, enabling students, DIY scientists, and citizen synthetic biologists to safely explore ideas without direct supervision from established practitioners.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to recognize that this democratization also comes with inherent risks. As the tools and knowledge required to engineer living systems become more widely accessible, so too does the potential for accidental or deliberate misuse. While AI can streamline technical workflows, it cannot replace the ethical judgment and social responsibility of human actors. Therefore, appropriate safeguards, oversight mechanisms, and educational initiatives must be put in place to ensure that biosafety and biosecurity standards are upheld even as the field expands to welcome new participants.\n\nTo provide a contextual framework, the following table summarizes key themes from prior reviews on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and synthetic biology. These works have predominantly explored how AI enables advancements in design, modeling, and automation, while simultaneously highlighting challenges such as ethical concerns, dual-use risks, and governance gaps. The main focus areas across these reviews include the technological potential of AI to democratize synthetic biology, the emerging risks associated with this democratization, and the policy and governance challenges that arise from rapid innovation (See Table 1).\n\nTable 1 Comparative overview of prior reviews on AI and synthetic biology integration Full size table\n\nThe comparative summary table highlights key themes across prior reviews, revealing both the significant strides made in understanding the convergence of AI and synthetic biology and the critical gaps that persist. While these works underscore the transformative potential of this intersection, they also highlight urgent challenges, including risk and governance challenges, and the need to demystify the ‘Black Box’. These overarching implications call for a holistic approach to addressing the societal, ethical, and regulatory dimensions of this technological convergence. The following sections build upon these insights by first exploring the nuanced risks and governance challenges associated with AI-synthetic biology, followed by a detailed discussion of actionable governance strategies and the role of human oversight. Together, these sections aim to bridge the gaps identified in prior literature and provide a forward-looking roadmap for managing the opportunities and risks of this rapidly evolving field.",

        "content": "Science AlphaFold reveals the structure of the protein universe Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy link ×\n\nRead about solving protein folding at deepmind.com/AlphaFold and see a timeline of our breakthrough here. It’s been one year since we released and open sourced AlphaFold, our AI system to predict the 3D structure of a protein just from its 1D amino acid sequence, and created the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AlphaFold DB) to freely share this scientific knowledge with the world. Proteins are the building blocks of life, they underpin every biological process in every living thing. And, because a protein’s shape is closely linked with its function, knowing a protein’s structure unlocks a greater understanding of what it does and how it works. We hoped this groundbreaking resource would help accelerate scientific research and discovery globally, and that other teams could learn from and build on the advances we made with AlphaFold to create further breakthroughs. That hope has become a reality far quicker than we had dared to dream. Just twelve months later, AlphaFold has been accessed by more than half a million researchers and used to accelerate progress on important real-world problems ranging from plastic pollution to antibiotic resistance. Today, I’m incredibly excited to share the next stage of this journey. In partnership with EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), we’re now releasing predicted structures for nearly all catalogued proteins known to science, which will expand the AlphaFold DB by over 200x - from nearly 1 million structures to over 200 million structures - with the potential to dramatically increase our understanding of biology.\n\nThis update includes predicted structures for plants, bacteria, animals, and other organisms, opening up many new opportunities for researchers to use AlphaFold to advance their work on important issues, including sustainability, food insecurity, and neglected diseases.\n\nToday’s update means that most pages on the main protein database UniProt will come with a predicted structure. All 200+ million structures will also be available for bulk download via Google Cloud Public Datasets, making AlphaFold even more accessible to scientists around the world.\n\n“ AlphaFold is the singular and momentous advance in life science that demonstrates the power of AI. Determining the 3D structure of a protein used to take many months or years, it now takes seconds. AlphaFold has already accelerated and enabled massive discoveries, including cracking the structure of the nuclear pore complex. And with this new addition of structures illuminating nearly the entire protein universe, we can expect more biological mysteries to be solved each day. Eric Topol\n\nFounder and Director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute\n\nAlphaFold’s impact so far Twelve months on from AlphaFold’s initial release, it’s been amazing to reflect on the incredible impact AlphaFold has already had, and our long journey to reach today’s milestone. For our team, AlphaFold’s success was especially rewarding, both because it was the most complex AI system we’d ever built, requiring multiple critical innovations, and because it has had the most meaningful downstream impact. By demonstrating that AI could accurately predict the shape of a protein down to atomic accuracy, at scale and in minutes, AlphaFold not only provided a solution to a 50-year grand challenge, it also became the first big proof point of our founding thesis: that artificial intelligence can dramatically accelerate scientific discovery, and in turn advance humanity. We open sourced AlphaFold’s code and published two in-depth papers in Nature [1, 2], which have already been cited more than 4000 times. We collaborated closely with the world-leading EMBL-EBI to design a tool that would best help biologists access and use AlphaFold, and together released the AlphaFold DB, a searchable database that is open and free to all. Before releasing AlphaFold, in line with our careful approach to pioneering responsibly, we sought input from more than 30 experts across biology research, security, ethics and safety to help us understand how to share the benefits of AlphaFold with the world, in a way that would maximise potential benefit and minimise potential risk. To date, more than 500,000 researchers from 190 countries have accessed the AlphaFold DB to view over 2 million structures. Our freely available structures have also been integrated into other public datasets, such as Ensembl, UniProt, and OpenTargets, where millions of users access them as part of their everyday workflows.\n\nWatch\n\nOther impressive examples, chosen by members of our AlphaFold team, include: A biological jigsaw, chosen by Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool In a recent special issue of Science, several groups described how AlphaFold helped them piece together the nuclear pore complex, one of the most fiendish puzzles in biology. The giant structure consists of hundreds of protein parts and controls everything that goes in and comes out of the cell nucleus. Its delicate structure was finally revealed by using existing experimental methods to reveal its outline and AlphaFold predictions to complete and interpret any areas that were unclear. This powerful combination is now becoming routine in labs, unlocking new science and showing how experimental and computational techniques can work together.\n\nA new world of bioinformatics, chosen by Richard Evans Structural search tools like Foldseek and Dali are allowing users to very quickly search for entries similar to a given protein. This could be a first step toward mining large sequence datasets for practically useful proteins, such as those that break down plastic, and it could provide clues about protein function. The update of the database to include over 200 million predicted structures will further amplify this impact. Direct impact on human health, chosen by John Jumper AlphaFold is already having a significant, direct impact on human health. Meeting with researchers at the European Society of Human Genetics revealed how important AlphaFold structures are to biologists and clinicians trying to unravel the causes of rare genetic diseases. In addition, AlphaFold is accelerating drug discovery by providing a better understanding of newly identified proteins that could be drug targets, and helping scientists to more quickly find potential medicines that bind to them.\n\n“ AlphaFold became an essential tool for biopharma research nearly overnight, including here at ROME Therapeutics where it is allowing us to predict protein structures in areas of the dark genome that have never been solved for before. AlphaFold speed and accuracy is accelerating the drug discovery process, and we’re only at the beginning of realising its impact on getting novel medicines to patients faster.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence firm DeepMind has transformed biology by predicting the structure of nearly all proteins known to science in just 18 months, a breakthrough that will speed drug development and revolutionise basic science\n\nPredicting the structure of proteins is one of the grand challenges of biology DeepMind\n\nDeepMind has predicted the structure of almost every protein so far catalogued by science, cracking one of the grand challenges of biology in just 18 months thanks to an artificial intelligence called AlphaFold. Researchers say that the work has already led to advances in combating malaria, antibiotic resistance and plastic waste, and could speed up the discovery of new drugs.\n\nDetermining the crumpled shapes of proteins based on their sequences of constituent amino acids has been a persistent problem for decades in biology. Some of these amino acids are attracted to others, some are repelled by water, and the chains form intricate shapes that are hard to accurately determine.\n\nThinking long-term to save the world Martin Rees at New Scientist Live this October\n\nUK-based AI company DeepMind first announced it had developed a method to accurately predict the structure of folded proteins in late 2020, and by the middle of it 2021 it had revealed that it had mapped 98.5 per cent of the proteins used within the human body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, the company announced that it is publishing the structures of more than 200 million proteins – nearly all of those catalogued on the globally recognised repository of protein research, UniProt.\n\nDeepMind has worked with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) to create a searchable store of all this information that can be easily and freely accessed by researchers around the world. Ewan Birney at EMBL-EBI calls the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database “a gift to humanity”.\n\n“As someone who’s been in genomics and computational biology since the 1990s, I’ve seen many of these moments come where you can sense the landscape shifting under you and the provision of new resources, and this has been one of the fastest,” he says. “I mean, two years ago, we just simply did not realise that this was feasible.”\n\nAlready delivering results\n\nDemis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind, says that the database makes finding a protein structure – which previously often took years – “almost as easy as doing a Google search”. DeepMind is owned by Alphabet, Google’s parent company.\n\nThe archive has already been used by scientists to advance research in a number of areas. Matt Higgins at the University of Oxford and his colleagues were researching a protein that they believed was key to interrupting the lifecycle of the malaria parasite, but were struggling to map its structure.\n\n“One of the experimental methods that we use is X-ray crystallography,” says Higgins. “We cause the proteins to form into lattices, fire X-rays at them and get information from those X-ray diffraction patterns to see what the molecule looks like. But we were never able, despite many years of work, to see in sufficient detail what this molecule looks like.”\n\nBut when AlphaFold was released, it gave a clear prediction of the structure of the protein that matched the information the researchers had been able to glean. They have now been able to design new proteins that they hope could serve as an effective malarial vaccine.\n\nBirney says that using X-ray crystallography to map the structure of a protein is expensive and time-consuming. “That means that experimentalists have to make choices about what they do, and AlphaFold hasn’t had to make choices,” he says. “I think we can be confident that there are new experiments and new insights coming through due to AlphaFold, which will impact ‘how does this particular parasite work’ or ‘why does this particular disease happen in humans’, for example.”\n\nResearchers have also used AlphaFold to engineer new enzymes to break down plastic waste and to learn more about the proteins that make bacteria resistant to antibiotics.\n\nWork still to be done\n\nKeith Willison at Imperial College London says that AlphaFold has unarguably “changed the world” of biological research, but that there are still problems to be solved in protein folding.\n\n“As soon as AlphaFold came out it was wonderful. You just take your favourite proteins and look them up now rather than having to make crystals,” he says. “I did the crystallographic structure of a protein complex, it took me about eight years. People are joking that crystallographers are going to be unemployed.”\n\nBut Willison points out that AlphaFold isn’t able to take any arbitrary string of amino acids and model exactly how they fold. Instead, it is only able to use parts of proteins and their structures that have been experimentally determined to predict how a new protein will fold.\n\nWhile the tool is often, even usually, extremely accurate, its structures are always predictions rather than explicitly calculated results. Nor has AlphaFold yet solved the complex interactions between proteins, or even made a dent in a small subset of structures, known as intrinsically disordered proteins, that seem to have unstable and unpredictable folding patterns.\n\n“Once you discover one thing, then there are more problems thrown up,” says Willison. “It’s quite terrifying actually, how complicated biology is.”\n\nTomek Wlodarski at University College London says that AlphaFold has had an enormous impact on many areas of biology, but that there are improvements to be made on accuracy, and that developing a model of how proteins fold – not just predicting their final structure – is a problem that DeepMind is yet to tackle.\n\nWlodarski says AlphaFold isn’t perfect, although it does indicate which parts of a prediction have a high accuracy and which it is less confident in.\n\n“We introduced a mutation, which we know experimentally completely unfolds the protein, but AlphaFold gave me the same structure as it gave without this mutation,” he says. “I did another test: I was removing residues from one end of the protein, because we know that with our protein, if you chop nine residues from one of the ends it will completely unfold the protein. And I managed to chop half of the protein sequence, and the algorithm still predicted it as a completely folded protein with exactly the same structure. So there are these problems.”\n\nPushmeet Kohli, who leads DeepMind’s scientific team, says that the company isn’t done with proteins yet and is working to improve the accuracy and capabilities of AlphaFold.\n\n“We know the static structure of proteins, but that’s not where the game ends,” he says. ‘We want to understand how these proteins behave, what their dynamics are, how they interact with other proteins. Then there’s the other area of genomics where we want to understand how the recipe of life translates into which proteins are created, when are they created and the working of a cell.”\n\nSign up to our free Health Check newsletter that gives you the health, diet and fitness news you can trust, every Saturday",

        "content": "magineImagine being able to speed up evolution – hypothetically – to learn which genes might have a harmful or beneficial effect on human health. Imagine, further, being able to rapidly generate new genetic sequences that could help cure disease or solve environmental challenges. Now, scientists have developed a generative AI tool that can predict the form and function of proteins coded in the DNA of all domains of life, identify molecules that could be useful for bioengineering and medicine, and allow labs to run dozens of other standard experiments with a virtual query – in minutes or hours instead of years (or millennia).\n\nThe open-source, all-access tool, known as Evo 2, was developed by a multi-institutional team co-led by Stanford’s Brian Hie, an assistant professor of chemical engineering and a faculty fellow in Stanford Data Science. Evo 2 was trained on a dataset that includes all known living species, including humans, plants, bacteria, amoebas, and even a few extinct species. Stanford Report talked to Hie about Evo 2’s advanced capabilities, why the scientific world is so eager to get its hands on this new tool, and how Evo 2 could reshape the biological sciences.\n\nFrom left to right: Michael Poli, Brian Hie, and Garyk Brixi. Biology is written in a combination of As, Cs, Gs, and Ts that can be hard to understand. The Evo2 team, co-led by Assistant Professor Brian Hie, aims to make the language of biology more accessible to researchers. | Video Kurt Hickman; image: Andrew Brodhead Close\n\nCan you give us the lay version of how Evo 2 works?\n\nAll life is encoded in DNA using just four chemicals, known as nucleotides. These complex molecules are abbreviated using the letters A, C, G, and T. The human genome, at 3 billion nucleotides long, is just a string of these four letters. Now, if you imagine DNA as the characters in a book that is 3 billion letters long, the individual genes are the words. They are spelled differently. Some have more letters than others. And they have different purposes and meanings – that is, they have different functions.\n\nWith AI, we can search for patterns in all that code and use it to predict what the next nucleotide in the sequence is likely to be. In this way, Evo 2 is able to generate – to write – new genetic code that has never existed before. With Evo 2, you can enter a sequence of up to 1 million nucleotides. The million-nucleotide window in biology is important, as it allows us to explore long-distance interactions between two or more genes that may not be physically close to one another on the DNA molecule. The longer context window could allow us to spot connections between these long-distance collaborators that we wouldn’t even know about with a shorter window.\n\nHow is Evo 2 different from Evo 1 – which came out just last year – and how did you advance the technology so quickly?\n\nHonestly, Evo 1 was more effective than we thought it would be. Evo 1 was trained on only 113,000 or so genomes of simpler life forms like bacteria and archaea, known as the prokaryotes.\n\nEvo 2, on the other hand, also includes the known genomes of 15,000 or so plants and animals – the eukaryotes – which includes humans. Our dataset has now expanded from about 300 billion nucleotides to almost 9 trillion with Evo 2. In terms of safety, we have left out the genomes of viruses to prevent Evo 2 from being used to create new or more dangerous diseases. It’s like a representative snapshot of all species on Earth. Because it has the potential to improve tasks related to human disease, we felt like we needed to share Evo 2 quickly.\n\nClaire Scully\n\nHow is Evo 2 like ChatGPT?\n\nIn a natural language processor, like ChatGPT, you can prompt it with some text, and it will autocomplete the sentence based on patterns from previously written words. Evo 2 does this with DNA. If you want to design a new gene, you prompt the model with the beginning of a gene sequence of base pairs, and Evo 2 will autocomplete the gene.\n\nSometimes that completion will look exactly like a gene found in nature, but other times the model will make some improvements or write the gene in a different way than has ever happened in evolutionary history. In the real world, these mutations happen by chance. With Evo 2, we can be more direct and steer toward mutations that have useful functions. Evo 2 also includes machine learning models that will tell you if the sequence exists in nature and predict how this new sequence will function in real life. Then we go into the lab and synthesize the DNA and insert it into a living cell to test it using a gene editing technology like CRISPR. Essentially, Evo 2 is speeding up evolution, providing promising new genetic paths for us to explore.\n\nHow do you hope other scientists will use Evo 2?\n\nWe hope that Evo 2 will someday have clinical significance. It is really good at discovery. Evo 2 could help predict which mutations lead to pathogenicity and disease. Everyone has random mutations in their DNA and, mostly, they’re harmless. But on rare occasions, they’ll cause cancer or other disease. The model is actually very good at distinguishing which mutations are just random, harmless variations and which cause disease. The last area we are hopeful about is using Evo 2 for designing new genetic sequences with specific functions of interest. Another relevant next step is integrating these models with models of systems biology that would help us learn about interactions between two or more genes to cause disease.\n\nCan you talk about the collaboration needed to make something like Evo 2 happen?\n\nSomething of this scale cannot be done by a single person. The three major institutions involved are Stanford, NVIDIA – which makes the AI computer chips and software to run it – and the Arc Institute, a biomedical research nonprofit that is itself a collaboration among Stanford, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn terms of personnel, we had three subteams. First, the machine learning team focused on training the model and making sure that the computers ran efficiently. Then, once you train a model, you need to know it actually works as intended. So there’s a team of biologists – computational, molecular, systems, prokaryotic, eukaryotic biologists – to make sure the information we are getting back is valuable and usable. And, last, we have an experimental biology team that synthesizes the new DNA, puts it into cells, and tests the cells to make sure what we’ve created works in real life. It’s all very hard work, and I’m very grateful to everyone on the team for their help.",

        "content": "“High quality, large-scale, fit-for-purpose datasets” continues to be the tagline for artificial intelligence (AI) models aiming to achieve scalable drug discovery to novel targets. While troves of public datasets from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) fueled AlphaFold, the AI milestone that made the grand leap of solving protein structure from sequence, sizable human translational data to power “zero-shot” drug design that can generalize to any therapeutic context remains an empty chest.\n\nIn a step toward addressing the human biology data gap, Jura Bio, a genomic medicines company, has announced VISTA, an AI-controlled data loop system to guide de novo (or from scratch) antibody design with applications in cancer therapy.\n\nJura is backed by renowned geneticist George Church, PhD, who is a co-founder of the company and professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School. Known as a prolific biotech entrepreneur, Church is tied to dozens of groundbreaking biotech companies from eGenesis, a pioneer for pig-to-human organ transplantation, to Colossal Biosciences, known for its de-extinction initiatives.\n\n“While computational protein design and genetic variation separately have been useful for decades, combined they are trillion-fold synergistic, filling each other’s serious gaps,” Church told GEN.\n\nIn the loop\n\nWhile the antibody therapeutics space possesses a wealth of sequence data, obtaining functional annotations crucial for drug discovery remains an ongoing gap. VISTA addresses this challenge by generating large-scale training datasets on tens of billions of sequence-target protein-protein interactions in a data loop steered with laboratory feedback.\n\nThe loop iterates in four steps: 1) build and train a generative model to map the sequence space of interest, 2) sample and synthesize untested sequences at high-scale using variational synthesis, 3) deliver designed sequences into human cells to evaluate translational and developability properties, and 4) test designed sequences against targets and off-targets simultaneously to collect activity data.\n\n“We have to map sequence to what really matters, which is clinical trial outcome,” Elizabeth Wood, PhD, CEO of Jura, told GEN. “Moving generative models for biological sequence into their natural hardware infrastructure with variational synthesis unlocked this tremendous scale that we’re able to approach.”\n\nVISTA emphasizes high clinical relevance by training the initial model on 320 million sequences from healthy humans with N-of-1 patient safety profiles.\n\nUsing the platform, Jura has reported successful de novo design of human antibody-derived single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) for challenging tumor antigen targets, including PRAME, a protein that is often found in melanoma, and MAGE-A4, a member of a family of cancer-testis antigens. These cancer-driving proteins have been historically elusive to hit because of their intracellular location. Traces of these proteins are only revealed on the cell surface as short peptide fragments in a transient complex with human leukocyte antigens (HLA).\n\nCompelling proof\n\nFounded in 2017, Jura is headquartered in Boston and was originally positioned as an immune-based therapeutics company. In September 2023, the company announced a research collaboration with Replay Bio’s product company, Syena, to advance T cell receptor natural killer (NK) therapies in cancer before its AI technology platform eventually took the spotlight.\n\n“The infrastructure we had built had become so powerful that it became the center of our attention,” Wood recalled. “We saw a real opportunity to use our underlying technology to solve more generic problems around creating sufficient data to train AI models.”\n\nAs the human antibody repertoire has theoretical access to over one quadrillion antibody combinations, Wood emphasized that targeted data generation guided by a wet lab informed AI feedback loop is imperative to avoid spending “10,000 years of time looking at the wrong places.” Research directions, such as modulating hit rate to tune the boundaries of explorable sequence diversity, require informed decision-making on a problem-by-problem basis. “With VISTA, we don’t have to make those decisions blind,” said Wood.\n\nAdditionally, in drug discovery, where each candidate can be a “$2 billion liability” between discovery and market approval, achieving reliable de novo designs provides a meaningful step toward scalable and cost-effective drug discovery pipelines. In this vein, VISTA can complete testing of 100 million new antibody designs at the same time, a scale that would cost hundreds of millions of dollars if approached using brute force expenditure alone.\n\nTaken together, Wood highlights that applying VISTA to antibody therapeutics, a highly documented modality with established markers of success early in the development process, achieved goals of both education and demonstration for this data loop system.\n\n“When you move away from an extremely well-characterized modality, others may not value the criteria of our design programs as much as we do,” said Wood. She highlights that showing success in antibodies is “more compelling” as a first proof-of-principle for the VISTA platform.",

        "content": "The problem with predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence, known as the 'protein folding problem', has been a central challenge not only for biology but also for chemistry and physics. Its importance lies in the fact that understanding how proteins fold is crucial to understanding their function in organisms and, by extension, in life itself. Furthermore, this understanding has significant practical applications, such as the design of optimized enzymes for industrial processes and the development of antibodies to combat various diseases.\n\nThe reason it is so important to know the three-dimensional structure of a protein is that its function primarily depends on its shape and not just on the specific amino acid sequence. Very different sequences may lead to similar shapes with practically identical functions, just as small changes in a protein sequence can denature it and destroy its function. For decades, physicists have tried to predict these structures by modeling the interactions between amino acids. However, the challenge is twofold: first, it is necessary to accurately model these interactions, which requires very well-calibrated force fields; second, even with good modeling, finding the minimum energy structure (i.e., the equilibrium state) is extremely slow from a computational perspective. This is because protein folding is a highly complex optimization problem, with many interactions that can be oppositional in nature. To date, molecular dynamics simulations have only been able to effectively reproduce the structures of very small proteins.\n\nIn the last decade, the approach to the protein folding problem has radically changed, primarily due to the massive accumulation of protein sequences in databases, made possible by the drastic reduction in the costs of genomic sequencing. The new idea was simple but innovative: although we do not fully understand how to model the interactions between amino acids, we now have access to a vast amount of data on protein sequences and their viable mutational variations, meaning those that have survived evolutionary pressure.\n\nInstead of trying to model the interactions at a physical level, researchers began to statistically study families of 'homologous proteins', that is, sequences with similar functions in different but evolutionarily related organisms. From this data, they were able to infer two key things: first, which amino acids could not mutate in isolation without denaturing the protein; and second, which pairs of amino acids needed to be in contact in the three-dimensional structure, as a mutation in one would destabilize those critical contacts and, consequently, the structure.\n\nThis bioinformatics approach, completely 'data-driven', combined with improved models that allowed for the identification of correlations beyond pairs of amino acids, enabled effective learning of 'important mutational couplings', that is, the constraints on how amino acids could change without altering the function of the protein. Subsequently, this strategy was combined with supervised 'machine learning' methods, where models learned to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins whose structures were already known, using their sequences as a training base.\n\nThis approach culminated in a historic milestone in 2020 during the CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) competition when AlphaFold2 was able to predict the structures of proteins that had never before been experimentally resolved with great accuracy. Surprisingly, this included proteins with very different sequences from those studied previously, where traditional methods failed spectacularly. Thus, the protein folding problem was practically solved, not through detailed physical modeling of its components, but by imitating patterns from stored evolutionary data.\n\n\n\nThis achievement has truly revolutionized computational biology, where the combination of large volumes of data with the power of artificial intelligence has surpassed decades of attempts based solely on physical models.",

        "content": "Evo 2, the largest AI model in biology to date, can accurately predict the effects of all types of genetic mutations\n\nMarking a major milestone for biomolecular sciences, a team of researchers — made up of scientists from UC Berkeley, Arc Institute, UCSF, Stanford University and NVIDIA — have developed a machine learning model trained on the DNA of over 100,000 species across the entire tree of life. The model, called Evo 2, can identify patterns in gene sequences across disparate organisms that experimental researchers would typically need years to uncover. In addition to identifying disease-causing mutations in human genes, Evo 2 can design new genomes that are as long as the genomes of simple bacteria.\n\nSimilar in scale to the most powerful generative AI large language models, Evo 2 is the largest AI model in biology to date. Building on its predecessor Evo 1, which was trained entirely on single-cell genomes, Evo 2 trained on over 9.3 trillion nucleotides — the building blocks that make up DNA or RNA — from over 128,000 whole genomes as well as metagenomic data. In addition to an expanded collection of bacterial, archaeal and phage genomes, Evo 2 includes information from humans, plants and other single-celled and multi-cellular species in the eukaryotic domain of life.\n\n“Our development of Evo 1 and Evo 2 represents a key moment in the emerging field of generative biology, as the models have enabled machines to read, write and think in the language of nucleotides,” said Patrick Hsu, UC Berkeley assistant professor of bioengineering, Arc Institute co-founder and co-senior author. “Evo 2 has a generalist understanding of the tree of life that’s useful for a multitude of tasks, from predicting disease-causing mutations to designing potential code for artificial life. We’re excited to see what the research community builds on top of these foundation models.”\n\nThe announcement and preprint are available on the Arc Institute’s website.",

        "content": "A 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck more than 100 miles off the Oregon Coast on Monday night, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There are no reports of damage.\n\nThe quake struck southwest of Port Orford just after 9 p.m. at a depth of about 8.6 miles. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports there’s no tsunami threat expected along the coast.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, at least 10 aftershocks were reported following the quake, with magnitudes between 2.7 and 5.1.\n\nSteven Sobieszczyk, a USGS spokesperson, said magnitude 5 earthquakes are not uncommon off the coast near the Oregon and California border.\n\n“Since January 2020, there have been at least 40 magnitude 5 or greater quakes off the coast of Oregon and northern California,\" Sobieszczyk said in an email. “If you go back 25 years to January 2000, there have been 164 earthquakes of that magnitude in that area.\"\n\nAccording to the USGS aftershock forecast for the coming week in the area, there’s a less than 1% chance of aftershocks larger than magnitude 5.\n\n“There will likely be smaller aftershocks within the next week, with up to 2 magnitude 3 or higher aftershocks,” the forecast reads. “Magnitude 3 and higher aftershocks are large enough to be felt nearby. The number of aftershocks will decrease over time, but a large aftershock can temporarily increase the number of aftershocks.”\n\nAnyone who felt the earthquake is asked to report it using the USGS \"Did you feel it?\" tool. As of 8 a.m. Tuesday, around 20 people had reported feeling the ground shake.\n\n**Related:** Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek wants new state buildings to be earthquake ready",

        "content": "Another\n\nearthquake measuring 6.9 magnitude hit southern Philippines on Friday, triggering a fresh tsunami alert hours after an earlier warning.\n\nAccording to authorities, the tremor struck at 7.12 pm, prompting the Philippine seismology office to warn of \"life-threatening wave heights\" and urge coastal residents to \"immediately evacuate to higher grounds or move farther inland\".\n\nThe aftershock, the largest of at least 300 recorded so far, came fewer than 10 hours after the Pacific seaboard of the southern major island of Mindanao was rocked by a 7.4-magnitude temblor, killing at least eight people.\n\nThe quake was caused by movement along a fault at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres (6 miles). The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu said hazardous waves were possible within 300 kilometres (186 miles) of the epicentre.\n\nIt said waves up to 3 metres (10 feet) above normal tides were possible on some Philippine coasts, and smaller waves were possible in Indonesia and Palau. Office of Civil Defense deputy administrator Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV warned that tsunami waves could hit six nearby coastal provinces from Davao Oriental up to two hours after the earthquake struck at 9.43 am He asked people to immediately move to higher ground or further inland away from coastal areas.\n\n“We urge these coastal communities to be on alert and immediately evacuate to higher grounds until further notice,” Alejandro said in a video news briefing.\n\n“Owners of boats in harbours and those in the coastal areas...should secure their boats and move away from the waterfronts,” he said. The Philippines is still recovering from a Sept. 30 earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9 that left at least 74 people dead and displaced thousands of people in the central province of Cebu, particularly Bogo city and outlying towns.\n\nOne of the world’s most disaster-prone countries, the Philippines is often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions because of its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of seismic faults around the ocean. The archipelago also is lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms each year, making disaster response a major task of the govt and volunteer groups.",

Five of them have been above magnitude 6.\n\nParts of the North Pacific were rattled by powerful aftershocks on Thursday, a day after one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded struck off the coast of Russia.\n\nDozens of aftershocks have been recorded since Wednesday’s quake, which prompted tsunami warnings and evacuations on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. Five were notably strong, registering a magnitude above 6.\n\nMost were recorded off Russia’s Far East. The latest was a 6.2 shock that occurred just before 5:30 p.m. local time, about 124 miles southeast of Severo-Kurilsk on the island of Paramushir.\n\nThe strongest, a 6.9-magnitude temblor, struck 91 miles southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on the Kamchatka Peninsula just before 10 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nWhile most official warnings in the U.S. and other nations were lifted on Wednesday, a 40-mile stretch of Northern California’s coastline remained under a tsunami advisory early Thursday. It ran from the boundary of Humboldt and Del Norte Counties to the Oregon border.\n\nYan Zhuang is a Times reporter in Seoul who covers breaking news.\n\n## Related Content\n\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "When a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit the east coast of Taiwan Wednesday morning, Carissa Wang, branding communication director of World Vision Taiwan, was on the Taipei subway on her way to work. She felt the carriage sway more than usual, and then it stopped at the next station as an announcement alerted passengers that service had ended due to an earthquake.\n\nWang and her World Vision colleagues immediately began putting disaster relief protocols into action, assembling their emergency team and reaching out to local government officials to coordinate relief at evacuation centers. World Vision social workers also began to contact the 3,000 sponsored children and their families in the epicenter of Hualien to make sure they were safe and find out if they needed help.\n\nWednesday’s quake was the worst to hit Taiwan in 25 years, damaging buildings and causing landslides. Images from Hualien, a city on the country’s east coast, showed a red brick building leaning at a 45-degree angle after its first floor collapsed. Large rocks tumbled down the side of mountains and blocked roads into the tourist destination of Taroko Gorge, trapping people at a hotel.\n\nYet Hualien sustained surprisingly little damage for an earthquake of such magnitude. As of Monday, 13 people had died, and only one of them was killed due to building damage. Most of the others were hit by falling rocks. Ten people are still missing and more than 1,000 were injured.\n\nThe low loss of life is attributed to Taiwan’s earthquake preparedness, as the government improved and reinforced building codes after a deadly earthquake in 1999 killed 2,400 people. Public education on earthquakes is widespread, and disaster relief groups are well-trained and respond quickly. Buddhist Tzu Chi Charity Foundation, one of the largest philanthropic organizations in Taiwan, said that within 30 minutes of the quake, it had set up a service center to pass out blankets and emergency financial aid.\n\nAlthough Christians make up less than 5 percent of the population, Christian aid groups including World Vision Taiwan, Mustard Seed Mission, and 1919 Food Bank have an outsized influence on disaster relief. The groups each have their niche and are working side by side to care for the victims. Groups like Tzu Chi and Red Cross Taiwan specialize in rescue and immediate relief, while Christian groups are more focused on caring for children and families in the impacted area, dealing with the emotional trauma of the quake, and reaching indigenous villages where they have existing relationships.\n\nThrough this collaboration, “evacuees have a place to stay, and those of us from Christian groups can accompany them and pray,” said Jeffrey Lee, CEO of Mustard Seed Mission. “Our role in this earthquake aftermath is that we seek the emotional stability of the children and the elderly.”\n\n## Working together in the shelters\n\nAfter the earthquake, staff at the Hualien branch of 1919 Food Bank, part of the Chinese Christian Relief Association, drove to the most impacted area and got in touch with their government contacts. They then helped set up evacuation centers at a school, a park, and a gymnasium.\n\nThe evacuation shelters demonstrated how the relief groups worked together. Tzu Chi, which is headquartered in Hualien, quickly brought in temporary beds and set up four-walled tents without a roof to provide privacy for the evacuees. The organization came up with the idea for these privacy barriers after a magnitude 6.2 earthquake hit Hualien in 2018, killing 17. The Red Cross provided tents, food, water, and other necessities.\n\nDue to their experience running a food bank, 1919 was tasked with collecting and distributing donated food and water as well as bringing in their mobile kitchen to make food for victims and frontline workers. Samuel Chang, director of the 1919 Food Bank, said that staff filled in wherever needed: Some helped check people in or provided power banks for people needing to charge their cell phones, while others comforted and prayed for people who arrived frightened and distraught.\n\nIn the shelters, World Vision set up children’s care centers, where staff worked to calm and distract traumatized children through activities such as singing and drawing, Wang said. They also helped watch the kids as parents returned to pack up belongings from homes deemed unsafe to live in.\n\nMembers of Mustard Seed Mission, a Christian community development nonprofit, sought to help aid workers by providing massages. Lee noted that many of them are exhausted and themselves impacted by the earthquake but because of their job, they can’t show that they’re scared. The masseuses not only relieved their physical tensions but served as friendly listeners, providing counsel and comfort.\n\nThe nonprofit has a vocational training center in Hualien, which it opened up for the government to place evacuees who need special care—for instance, the elderly or families with young children—and for whom the center’s dormitory is more comfortable than a school auditorium. Every day, Mustard Seed houses and feeds about 60 people.\n\n## Learning from Buddhist counterparts\n\nChang of 1919 (which in Chinese is a homophone for “need help”) observed that there are things Christian groups can learn from Tzu Chi, a group rooted in humanistic Buddhism. Master Cheng Yen, a Buddhist nun in Taiwan, founded the organization in 1966 in response to the suffering of the impoverished community where she lived. Three Catholic nuns visited Cheng, and as they discussed their religions, they asked her why Buddhists weren’t setting up nursing homes, orphanages, and hospitals if their religion teaches love and compassion for all living beings. Convicted, she began collecting donations for the poor and needy.\n\nToday, the international humanitarian group claims to have 10 million members active in 100 countries and territories around the world, engaging in medical aid, environmental protection, and disaster relief.\n\nIn Taiwan, Tzu Chi is the most prominent relief group and are experts at what they do, said Chang. Most impressive is their ability to mobilize their members to donate and volunteer when disasters occur. He’s found that, when working alongside Tzu Chi members at a disaster site, they are always willing to take the most thankless and menial jobs—like cleaning the bathroom—whereas sometimes Christians are less willing to do so.\n\nChang believes the different groups complement each other well. To accommodate their religious dietary restrictions, 1919 prepares vegetarian meals for the Buddhist Tzu Chi volunteers. Tzu Chi has also invited 1919 leaders to meet with their monks to coordinate disaster response among the indigenous groups, many of whom are Christians and have closer connections to Christians organizations.\n\nLee agrees: “Even though we come from different faiths, in this circumstance, it’s a great match as we care for these people.”\n\n## Encountering God in the disaster\n\nMost of the Christian groups’ work occurs outside of the immediate rescue and relief efforts, among the children and families whom they typically serve. To do that well, they often partner with the local church, which can better gauge a community’s needs, said Chang. “The church is local, they know every family and they know every neighbor’s needs,” he said.\n\nThe organization works with about 1,500 churches in Taiwan (one-third of the total number nationwide), helping to set up food banks and afterschool centers and to provide financial assistance. After the earthquake, 1919 reached out to partner churches to find needs that they can assist with. For instance, they are working on a partnership with IKEA to provide furniture to some of the earthquake victims, as well as replacing televisions or water tanks to help families return to normalcy.\n\n“We hope that through these social services, they can see the values of our faith and the comfort that our faith can bring in their trials,” Chang said. “We hope that through the gospel and caring for their welfare, they can encounter God even in the midst of this disaster.”\n\nWorld Vision and Mustard Seed both arrange sponsorships for children in impoverished communities and work in community development. World Vision staff visited their sponsored children to check the structural integrity of their homes and to determine whether repairs are needed. They found that about 180 of their families in Hualien have been impacted by the earthquake, either because the family’s home is unsafe to live in or because the parents lost their jobs.\n\nWorld Vision is also involved in rebuilding the children’s confidence and security, especially since the region experienced more than 400 aftershocks following the big quake. In communities where resources are already limited, getting people back to normal life is even more important to ensure that kids stay in school and income remains stable.\n\n“In terms of water and food, there is enough as the people of Taiwan are full of love,” Wang said. “But what we need to work on is rebuilding the homes, dealing with the children’s trauma, and quickly returning them to their ordinary lives.”\n\n## Providing aid to indigenous groups\n\nAnother focus of Mustard Seed, founded by American missionary Lillian Dickson after World War II, is on Taiwan’s indigenous people, who often live in remote mountainous areas. About 70 percent of indigenous people in Taiwan are believers, as many were receptive to the gospel shared by foreign missionaries due to the ostracism they had suffered from the Japanese and ethnic Hans in the lowlands.\n\nAfter the Hualien earthquake, landslides along curving mountain roads blocked access to some of these indigenous villages. Because Mustard Seed partners with these churches, they were able to quickly find out where the needs were. On Friday, Lee said that one village told them they were running low on food and clean water, so staff loaded up a truck with 70 food packs and about 850 water bottles to deliver to them. Suddenly it started to rain, causing concern about the road conditions.\n\nSo they switched gears and decided instead to bring the aid by train. They asked the railway authorities if they could pack the goods onto the train car, and the authorities agreed. About a dozen people hauled the food packs and water onto the train, and when they reached the station near the tribal village, strangers helped them move the goods off the train. Villagers met them at the station and brought the supplies the rest of the way.\n\n“Because we have the same Christian faith, it’s very natural for us to trust each other during this rescue process,” he said.\n\nLong-term, all the Christian groups intend to prioritize dealing with the emotional and mental health of those affected by the quake. Many of the families in Hualien had to repair their homes after the 2018 earthquake, only to have another large-scale earthquake hit six years later, said Chang. As many live in fear of the next earthquake, he believes the church can play a role in providing counseling to locals. He’s looking for Christian counselors to go to Hualien and provide these services through the church. Mustard Seed is seeing similar needs and also recruiting counseling students and teachers from Taiwan’s seminaries to help families in Hualien. “Even for nonbelievers, prayer and professional consultation can calm emotions after trauma,” Lee said. “We hope to provide for not only their physical needs but also for their psychological stability.”",

        "content": "Supported by\n\n# What We Know About the Earthquake in Taiwan\n\nThe quake set off aftershocks and damaged dozens of buildings, killing nine people and leaving many injured or trapped.\n\nA powerful 7.4-magnitude earthquake that rocked Taiwan during the morning commute on Wednesday was the strongest quake to hit the island in 25 years.\n\nIt initially triggered forecasts of tsunami waves in China, Japan and the Philippines, but those warnings were later canceled. There were more than 100 aftershocks and more were expected over the next three to four days.\n\nHere’s what we know about the earthquake and its aftermath.\n\n## What is the death toll?\n\nThe earthquake killed at least nine people and injured more than 930 others, Taiwan’s fire department said Wednesday evening. Dozens remained trapped.\n\nAmong the dead were at least three hikers who were hit by falling rocks on a trail in Taroko National Park, according to the state-owned Central News Agency.\n\n## What parts of Taiwan were affected?\n\nThe heaviest damage was in Hualien County on the east coast near the epicenter, which was about 11 miles south of the city of Hualien, the county seat. All nine people who died were in the county, the authorities said. But the quake was felt throughout Taiwan.\n\nBuildings shook for more than a minute in the capital, Taipei. Rail services were halted across the island. Airlines canceled or delayed dozens of flights. More than 360,000 households lost power at one point on Wednesday, according to Taiwan’s Central Emergency Operation Center.\n\n## What was damaged?\n\nThe worst damage was in the city of Hualien, where several buildings were tilted over with their ground-floor levels crushed. One of the buildings, a 10-story structure that housed a mix of homes and shops, was one of the centers of the rescue efforts.\n\nThroughout Taiwan, the quake and its aftershocks caused 15 buildings to collapse partially and damaged 67 others. One building in Changhua County, on the west coast, collapsed entirely, according to Taiwan’s fire department.\n\nThe quake also set off at least nine landslides on a major highway in Hualien, according to Taiwan’s Central News Agency, which said part of the road had collapsed.\n\n## How prepared was Taiwan?\n\nTaiwan has improved its level of preparation over decades of experiencing destructive earthquakes. It has refined its early warning system since the 1980s. It also updated its building codes in 2022, requiring owners of vulnerable structures to install reinforcements.\n\nTaiwan established an urban search-and-rescue team and opened several emergency medical operation centers after an earthquake in central Taiwan killed nearly 2,500 people in 1999. The government also ordered a wave of building inspections in 2018 after 17 people died in a quake in Hualien.\n\n## Why has Taiwan had so many earthquakes?\n\nMany deadly earthquakes have struck Taiwan in the past century. The island sits on several active faults, which are associated with seismic activity. It is near the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an area the U.S. Geological Survey says is the most seismically and volcanically active zone in the world.\n\nJohn Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.

        "content": "# 7.8 magnitude quake off Kamchatka was one of many aftershocks since July\n\n##### Alaska Earthquake Center says it likely won’t be the last either\n\nANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - The 7.8 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Kamchatka on Thursday morning was an aftershock of the larger, 8.8 magnitude earthquake on July 29, and likely not the last, according to the Alaska Earthquake center.\n\nSeismologists with the Alaska Earthquake Center detected Thursday’s quake on their sensors, the largest aftershock since July’s mainshock, but that could change. Aftershocks can continue for years after an earthquake and can be larger than the initial quake.\n\n“When you have a large earthquake like this, you’re going to have lots of aftershocks because stress has been building up over time and it’s not all going to be released in one big earthquake,” said Heather McFarlin, a seismologist with the Alaska Earthquake Center.\n\n“You’re going to have other parts of the fault that have to have their stress released, and so, yeah, you’re going to get lots of earthquakes in that area along that fault that are going to happen over the next several years,” McFarlin said.\n\nWhile aftershocks will likely continue in that same region, McFarlin said they don’t expect it to trigger earthquakes in other parts of the world.\n\nThursday’s aftershock also triggered a tsunami advisory in the Aleutian Islands, though it was cancelled a few hours later. The Tsunami Warning Center said it produced a small Tsunami, but nothing that would be a threat.\n\nThe resulting tsunami after the July 29 earthquake did reach the Aleutian Islands but based on the location and size of the earthquake, did not reach mainland Alaska, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center.\n\nMcFarlin said future aftershocks could continue to trigger small tsunamis and also have the potential to be larger than the 8.8 magnitude earthquake on July 29, which would then be categorized as a “foreshock.”\n\nIn fact, that large July quake was preceded by a series of foreshocks, including one coming in at a magnitude around 7.4, which McFarlin said the center believed was the peak, until it was dethroned.\n\n“We thought that would be the mainshock cause it had all of its own aftershock sequences,” McFarlin said. “And then the 8.8 happened.”\n\n*See a spelling or grammar error?

        "content": "Wu was preparing breakfast for guests at the small hotel he runs in Taiwan’s Hualien County when the shelves around him shook violently and the mountain behind his house roared.\n\nFearing the building would collapse, he rushed his guests to safety outdoors. Across the river, steep slopes were slipping from the mountains, the air swallowed by clouds of dust.\n\nBut Wu’s house suffered little damage from Wednesday’s 7.4 magnitude tremor, Taiwan’s most powerful in 25 years, something he attributes to a wider push to make the island more quake-resistant.\n\n“Our government conducted a comprehensive review of building codes after the 1999 earthquake, and all buildings going up must use new technologies that make them more resilient to earthquakes,” he says.\n\nFifteen years ago when he started building his two-story guesthouse near the entrance to Taroko Gorge – a national park famed for its steep, marble-walled canyons – Wu had to get government approval of its earthquake-preparedness.\n\nAnd experts say changes like this have helped the tremor-prone island avoid mass casualties in quakes like the one that hit on Wednesday.\n\n“I feel very lucky,” says Wu of the remarkably low-level damage wrought by the massive quake. “It’s not too bad.”\n\nIt’s a similar story in Hualien, a city just 11 miles from the epicenter, which looks strikingly calm the day after the tremor.\n\nStores and restaurants have reopened, as have roadside stalls selling fruit, vegetables and snacks. Trains to the city, suspended as a precaution on Wednesday, have resumed and are running on schedule.\n\nThe most potent sign of the quake is a 10-story red-brick tower in the city center, leaning precariously at a 45-degree angle after its ground floor collapsed. Excavators have heaped rubble at the base of the Uranus Building, to prop it up.\n\nEmergency workers have started repairing dozens of damaged buildings and demolishing four deemed impossible to save. But for the most part, the city of 100,000 people on Taiwan’s scenic east coast has emerged unscathed.\n\nThat is not to understate the earthquake’s power. Taiwan’s seismologists describe the tremor as having an energy equivalent to 32 of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima. It rocked the entire island of Taiwan and was felt as far away as Hong Kong and Shanghai.\n\nChong, a 52-year-old housekeeper, said she had lived through plenty of earthquakes in Hualien. “But the scale of this earthquake was very frightening,” she said. “I’ve never experienced an earthquake this big in my 50 years here in Hualien.”\n\nWednesday’s earthquake shook more parts of Taiwan with greater intensity than any other quake since 1999, when a 7.7 magnitude tremor hit the middle of the island, killing 2,400 people and injuring 10,000 others.\n\nBut this time, the number of casualties is much lower. As of Thursday, 10 people had been killed and just over 1,000 were injured, while two dozen remained missing, according to authorities.\n\n“It is a pretty miraculous outcome,” said Daniel Aldrich, a professor of political science and public policy at Northeastern University who studies the resilience of cities, calling the toll “a very low number of deaths by a strong, powerful earthquake near an urban center.”\n\n“The other disasters around 7.5 (magnitude) have caused far more casualties than we’ve seen so far in Taiwan,” he said, citing the tens of thousands of deaths during previous quakes in Haiti, India and China.\n\n## ‘We grew up with quakes’\n\nWednesday’s quake struck Taiwan’s rural east coast. The island’s west is where most people live, home to the largest cities, an extensive high-speed rail network and much of the industrial heartland.\n\nMost of the destruction – and deaths – occurred in remote rural areas in the wider Hualien County.\n\nThe victims were mostly killed outdoors by falling rocks or landslides. Four of them were hiking in Taroko Gorge, four died on mountainous highways, and another was working at a remote quarry, according to authorities.\n\nSo far, only one person was killed in a collapsed building – the Uranus Building in downtown Hualien. She initially escaped but went back to rescue her pet cat, CNN affiliate SET reported.\n\nTaiwan’s recent push for preparedness comes from the hard lessons learned from the devastating quake 25 years ago, experts say.\n\nWhen the earthquake struck in 1999, Taiwan was very unprepared, Aldrich said, citing corruption in the construction industry, the lack of building regulations, and inadequate coordination in rescue efforts.\n\nThat quake left more than 100,000 buildings across Taiwan completely or partially collapsed, including nearly 300 schools. Buildings were also flattened in the capital Taipei, about 100 miles from the epicenter.\n\n“What we’ve seen since then are massive upgrades across the board, what I would call a top-down on a bottom-up set of responses,” Aldrich said.\n\nFrom the top down, the government strengthened disaster management laws, improved coordination for rescue and relief, and enforced stricter building codes for earthquake resistance.\n\n“They’ve issued massive fines and penalties for construction firms found to have in any way cut corners on their construction. And there has been a really serious investment in all the new buildings,” Aldrich said.\n\nThe government launched a campaign to evaluate, retrofit or rebuild public buildings to enhance their ability to withstand stronger quakes, with schools being a priority. The campaign has since extended to private buildings, such as Wu’s.\n\nSeptember 21 – the date the deadly earthquake struck in 1999 – is now a designated day for disaster drills in Taiwan, with mock alert messages sent to mobile phones across the island and schools staging evacuation exercises.\n\nThe mayor of Hualien, Wei Chia-yen, attributes the relatively low death toll in his city to advanced preparation.\n\n“Here in Hualien, we grew up with earthquakes,” he said inside a gymnasium turned shelter at a primary school, set up within hours of the quake.\n\nRows of tents have been put up for residents whose homes have been damaged, or who are afraid to return due to aftershocks, while boxes of food and drinks are spread out on the tables.\n\nWei was himself injured by a cabinet falling on his left leg and was using crutches to get around the shelter.\n\n“Our teachers and relatives always taught us how to react when earthquakes strike,” he said. “So we’ve known about this since we were kids.”\n\nJan Camenzind-Broomby and Kenza Wilks contributed reporting.",

        "content": "Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula and surrounding Pacific Rim regions continued to experience seismic instability, with dozens of aftershocks being reported on Saturday by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).\n\nAccording to USGS's earthquake tracker map, some of those aftershocks have been up to a 6 magnitude. These fresh tremors in Russia followed an 8.8 magnitude earthquake that struck off the Kamchatka coast on Wednesday, which triggered a tsunami that sent waves across the Pacific, prompting evacuations and emergency declarations from Russia to Hawaii.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of damage following Saturday's aftershocks.\n\n*Newsweek *has reached out to the USGS for comment Saturday via email during non-working hours.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nThe aftershocks highlight persistent risks they pose and underscores the vulnerability of communities and global coastlines in the Pacific Ring of Fire, a region marked by intense tectonic activity.\n\nClosely monitored aftershocks have prompted renewed safety concerns—further testing local and international emergency preparedness in the face of natural disasters that can send waves and repercussions thousands of miles from the epicenter.\n\n**What To Know**\n\nThe initial magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck on Wednesday at a shallow depth of approximately 12 miles. Its epicenter was approximately 74 miles east-southeast of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, according to the USGS.\n\nBy Saturday, new tremors were confirmed in the region, including significant aftershocks measuring a magnitude of 6.07 and above on the Kuril Islands—already reeling from earlier flooding and property damage.\n\nAt least 50 aftershocks above a 4 magnitude have been reported since the initial earthquake, according to the USGS map.\n\nTsunami warnings rippled out from Russia on Wednesday, affecting Japan, Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, French Polynesia, and Chile.\n\nImmediate and widespread evacuations impacted over 2 million people as coastal towns braced for potential waves. The initial quake partially flooded Russian ports, damaged buildings, injured several people in the Kamchatka region, and triggered the eruption of the region's Klyuchevskoy volcano.\n\nDrone footage reviewed by authorities revealed extensive shoreline inundation in Russian coastal towns, with the port of Severo-Kurilsk sustaining waves of up to 16 feet that briefly submerged critical infrastructure, the BBC reported.\n\nTsunami waves up to 3.6 feet reached California while Hawaii saw water pull back by as much as 30 feet. In Alaska, waves nearing three feet were recorded in Adak.\n\n**What People Are Saying**\n\n**Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press briefing Wednesday:** \"We were fully deployed and ready to respond is necessary, but grateful that we didn't have to deal with the situation that this could have been.\"\n\n**Simon Boxall, oceanographer at the University of Southampton, per PBS :** \"It's a bit like throwing a very, very large rock into the sea and then watching the waves propagate away from that rock, that splash. And so that's what's happened in this case. And that's why this particular one has generated a tsunami. It's not huge. It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage, and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground.''\n\n**What Happens Next?**\n\nDamage assessment teams are continuing investigations in impacted Russian regions, with restoration efforts underway for ports and essential infrastructure.\n\nThe United States National Tsunami Warning Center and international partners continue to monitor the situation and urge any residents in affected areas to remain vigilant and avoid shoreline areas until further notice.\n\nScientists, meanwhile, have indicated the threat to U.S. coastlines has declined, but fluctuating currents still pose risks to swimmers and boaters.",

        "content": "# Deadly earthquakes strike Philippines, triggering temporary tsunami warnings\n\nTwo powerful quakes struck off the southern Philippines on Friday, killing at least six people and triggering tsunami warnings that were later lifted.\n\nThe biggest of the quakes, with a magnitude of 7.4, hit about 12 miles off Manay town in the Mindanao region just before 10 a.m., according to the United States Geological Survey.\n\nAn aftershock with a magnitude of 6.7 rocked the same area almost 10 hours later, one of scores that followed the morning quake.\n\nBoth came 11 days after a magnitude 6.9 earthquake killed 75 people and injured more than 1,200 in Cebu province in the central Philippines, according to official data.\n\nThree miners tunneling for gold were killed when a shaft collapsed in the mountains west of Manay during the larger quake, rescue official Kent Simeon of Pantukan town told the Agence France-Presse.\n\nOne miner was pulled out alive and several others were injured in the remote hamlet of Gumayan, he said.\n\n\"Some tunnels collapsed, but the miners managed to get out,\" Simeon said.\n\nOne person was killed in Mati city, the largest urban center near the epicenter, when a wall collapsed, while another suffered a fatal heart attack, officials said.\n\nAnother person was also crushed by falling debris in Davao city, more than 100 miles west of the epicenter, police said.\n\nTwo patients died of heart attacks at a hospital during the first earthquake, Ednar Dayanghirang, regional director of the government's Office of Civil Defense, told The Associated Press by telephone.\n\nPhilippine authorities issued tsunami warnings shortly after the morning quake, ordering evacuations along the eastern seaboard.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center lifted its alert for the Philippines, Palau and Indonesia at around noon.\n\n## \"People screamed and ran\"\n\nWes Caasi, an official in Tagum city, northwest of Manay, told AFP that a government event at the city hall descended into chaos as panicked attendees fled. \"They screamed and ran.\"\n\nConfirming videos that circulated on social media, Caasi said she saw city workers scrambling down a metal Christmas tree they were decorating when the first quake struck.\n\nNice Eugenio from Tagum city told AFP the strong aftershock knocked out power in her neighborhood.\n\n\"It lasted only a few seconds, but (it) was very strong. I felt like I was going to faint from nervousness,\" she said.\n\nA plane that had just landed in Davao city was shaken by the aftershock, which prevented passengers from disembarking immediately, an AFP photographer on board said.\n\nWitnesses and officials said the quakes appeared to have caused only minor damage, while the Philippine seismology office said it had recorded more than 300 aftershocks.\n\nOffice of Civil Defense deputy administrator Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV said that several buildings sustained cracks in their walls, including an international airport in Davao city, but it remained operational without any flights being canceled, Alejandro said.\n\n\"I was driving my car when it suddenly swayed and I saw power lines swaying wildly. People darted out of houses and buildings as the ground shook and electricity came off,\" Jun Saavedra, a disaster mitigation officer of Governor Generoso town in Davao Oriental, told AP by cellphone.\n\n\"We've had earthquakes in the past, but this was the strongest,\" Saavedra said, adding that the intense ground swaying caused cracks in several buildings, including a high school, where about 50 students were brought to a hospital by ambulance after sustaining bruises, fainting or becoming dizzy because of the first quake.\n\nMore than 200 patients were evacuated from the Manay district hospital, where tents were set up outside to shelter them after the building's foundations cracked, Dayanghirang said.\n\nDianne Lacorda, a Davao Oriental police officer, told AFP that power and communication lines were down, hampering damage assessments.\n\nClasses were suspended and non-essential workers were sent home, the provincial government said on Facebook.\n\n## \"Shaking was so strong\"\n\nChristine Sierte, a teacher in the town of Compostela near Manay, said the violent shaking started when she was in an online meeting.\n\n\"It was very slow at first, then it got stronger. ... That's the longest time of my life. We weren't able to walk out of the building immediately because the shaking was so strong,\" she told AFP.\n\n\"The ceilings of some offices fell, but luckily no one was injured,\" she said.\n\nEarthquakes are a near-daily occurrence in the Philippines, which is situated on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\", an arc of intense seismic activity stretching from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.\n\nAn 8.0-magnitude quake off Mindanao island's southwest coast in 1976 unleashed a tsunami that left 8,000 people dead or missing, the Philippines' deadliest natural disaster.",

        "content": "July 30 (Reuters) - A very powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake off Russia's Far Eastern Kamchatka coast on Wednesday triggered tsunami warnings as far away as French Polynesia and Chile, and was followed by an eruption of the most active volcano on the peninsula.\n\nThe shallow quake damaged buildings and injured several people in the remote Russian region, while much of Japan's eastern seaboard - devastated by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami in 2011 - was ordered to evacuate, as were parts of Hawaii.\n\nSign up here.\n\nBy the evening, Japan, Hawaii and Russia had downgraded most tsunami warnings. But authorities in French Polynesia warned residents of several of the remote Marquesas Islands to move to higher ground and expect waves as high as 2.5 metres (8 feet).\n\nTsunami waves began hitting the Marquesas on Wednesday but were forecast to be smaller than initially feared, local authorities said.\n\nSome initial wave surges were reported on Nuku Hiva, the largest of the Marquesas, about 1,400 km northeast of Tahiti, and between five to 10 additional waves were expected in the coming hours, the high commission said.\n\nRussian scientists said the quake in Kamchatka was the most powerful to hit the region since 1952. The U.S. Geological Survey said it was shallow, at a depth of 19.3 km (12 miles), and centred 119 km (74 miles) east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city of 165,000.\n\n\"It felt like the walls could collapse any moment. The shaking lasted continuously for at least three minutes,\" said Yaroslav, 25, in the city.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there had been no casualties in Russia, crediting solid building construction and the smooth operation of alert systems.\n\nIn Severo-Kurilsk in the northern Kuril Islands, tsunami waves exceeded 3 metres, with the largest up to 5 metres, Russia's RIA news agency reported. A quake of magnitude 6.07 later struck the Kuril Islands that lie between Kamchatka and northern Japan, the German Research Center for Geosciences said.\n\nTsunami waves partially flooded the port and a fish processing plant in the town, sweeping vessels from moorings, regional officials and Russia's emergency ministry said. Verified drone footage showed the town's entire shoreline submerged, with taller buildings and some storage facilities surrounded by water.\n\nThe Klyuchevskoy volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula began erupting later, a geological monitoring service said. Located around 450 km (280 miles) north of the regional capital, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Klyuchevskoy is one of the highest volcanoes in the world.\n\n\"A descent of burning hot lava is observed on the western slope. Powerful glow above the volcano, explosions,\" the Russian Academy of Sciences' United Geophysical Service said on Telegram.\n\n## WAVES IN HAWAII, JAPAN\n\nHawaii recorded waves of up to 1.7 metres while in Japan the largest recorded came to 1.3 metres, officials said.\n\nFlights out of Honolulu airport resumed in the evening, the transportation department said.\n\nWaves of nearly half a metre were observed as far away as California, with smaller ones reaching Canada's province of British Columbia. But a tsunami advisory was cancelled for coastal British Columbia as well as coastal areas of south Alaska.\n\nIn French Polynesia, waves hit some islands in the early morning hours. In other parts, wave heights were expected to remain below 30 cm, not requiring evacuation or sheltering.\n\nWhile the Marquesas are high-rising volcanic islands, much of French Polynesia consists of low-lying atolls.\n\n## WARNINGS ACROSS THE PACIFIC\n\nAuthorities in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands, some 970 km (600 miles) off South America's western coast, ordered precautionary evacuations to safe zones.\n\nTsunami alarms sounded in coastal towns across Japan's Pacific coast and evacuation orders were issued for tens of thousands of people.\n\nWorkers evacuated the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant, where a meltdown following the 2011 tsunami caused a radioactive disaster, operator TEPCO said.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said no injuries or damage had been reported, and there were no irregularities at any nuclear plants.\n\n## 'RING OF FIRE'\n\nKamchatka and Russia's Far East sit on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active region that is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The quake occurred on what is known as a \"megathrust fault\" where the denser Pacific Plate is sliding underneath the lighter North American Plate, according to scientists.\n\nThe Pacific Plate has been on the move, making the Kamchatka Peninsula off Russia's Far East coast especially vulnerable, and bigger aftershocks could not be ruled out, they said.\n\nVideo footage from the region's health ministry showed a team of medics in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky performing surgery as the quake shook their operating theatre. The medics used their hands to try to steady both the patient and their equipment, CCTV footage released by the Kamchatka region's health ministry showed.\n\nReporting by Anusha Shah Nilutpal Timsina, Mrinmay Dey, Shivani Tanna and Gursimran Kaur in Bengaluru, Lidia Kelly in Melbourne, Satoshi Sugiyama, Chang-Ran Kim and John Geddie in Tokyo, Nur-Azna Sanusiin Singapore and Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Writing by Lincoln Feast, Saad Sayeed, Hugh Lawson and Nick Zieminski; Editing by Stephen Coates, Michael Perry, Sharon Singleton, Frances Kerry and Daniel Wallis\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

        "content": "# Taiwan is hit by its strongest earthquake in nearly 25 years\n\nTAIPEI, Taiwan — A major earthquake struck Taiwan during the morning rush hour on Wednesday, collapsing buildings and triggering tsunami warnings in Japan and the Philippines.\n\nAt least 9 people were reported dead and 963 were injured in the strongest earthquake that has not seen since 1999, Taiwanese officials said.\n\nThe quake hit near the eastern city of Hualien at 7:58 a.m. local time (2358 GMT) and had a magnitude of 7.4, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, making it the strongest quake to hit since 1999. The depth was about 35 kilometers (22 miles), which is considered shallow. Taiwan's earthquake monitoring agency gave the magnitude as 7.2.\n\nStrong shaking was felt in Taipei, the capital, some 100 miles away, with aftershocks continued for roughly two hours. And there were reports in China that people as far away as Shanghai, about 500 miles to the north, could feel the earthquake.\n\nImages on television showed extensive damage, including buildings listing to the side after having been shaken off their foundations. The authorities suspended work and school in Hualien, an area with about 300,000 residents. Officials also closed down eight power plants for safety, and 87,000 residents in Hualien, the epicenter, were without power, though electricity remains on for the rest of the island.\n\nTSMC, the world's leading maker of cutting edge microchips, temporarily evacuated production lines after the quake.\n\nTaiwan's transportation authorities said train service was suspended island-wide, as well as subway service in Taipei. Videos from the epicenter show rockslides covering roads and houses that were knocked off-kilter.\n\nAn initial tsunami warning issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency was lifted later on Wednesday. The AP reported that a wave of 30 centimeters (about 1 foot) was detected on the coast of Yonaguni island about 15 minutes after the quake struck. JAMA said waves likely also hit the coasts of Miyako and Yaeyama islands.\n\nIn the Philippines, no tsunami warning was issued, but residents in various coastal areas were advised to move to higher ground or move inland.\n\nAccording to Taiwan media, the last earthquake of a magnitude 7 or greater to hit the island was the Sept. 21, 1999, \"Jiji\" earthquake that measured 7.3, which destroyed thousands of buildings and killed more than 2,400 people.\n\n*John Ruwitch contributed reporting from Beijing.*",

Overnight, at least 143 people remained trapped under rubble, authorities said, including more than 70 quarry workers.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nEnd of carouselThe earthquake hit about 15 miles south of Hualien county just before 8 a.m. local time.

        "content": "HUALIEN, Taiwan, April 3 (Reuters) - Taiwan's biggest earthquake in at least 25 years killed nine people on Wednesday and injured more than 900, while 50 workers travelling in minibuses to a hotel in a national park were missing.\n\nSome buildings tilted at precarious angles in the mountainous, sparsely populated county of Hualien, near the epicentre of the 7.2 magnitude quake, which struck just offshore at about 8 a. m. (0000 GMT) and triggered massive landslides.\n\nSign up here.\n\nAs darkness fell, some people were spending the night in tents and other shelters. Meanwhile scores of emergency workers were trying to shore up damaged buildings and demolish those deemed impossible to save.\n\n\"The Uranus building behind us is a very badly damaged place. It is a building with one basement level and nine floors above ground. The first and second floors are now underground,\" Deputy Acting Chief of Hualien Fire Department Lee Lung-Sheng said.\n\nHualien city mayor Hsu Chen-Wei said all residents and businesses in buildings that were in a dangerous state had been evacuated. Demolition work was beginning on four buildings, the mayor said.\n\nMore than 50 aftershocks were recorded, weather officials said.\n\n\"I'm afraid of aftershocks, and I don't know how bad the shaking will be,\" a 52-year-old Hualien resident, who gave her family name as Yu, said as she made her way to a shelter.\n\nThe power of the quake was captured live as news anchors delivered their breakfast bulletins, steadying themselves against giant screens as their sets swayed and lighting rigs rocked back and forth overhead.\n\nThe earthquake hit at a depth of 15.5 km (9.6 miles), as people were headed for work and school, setting off a tsunami warning for southern Japan and the Philippines that was later lifted.\n\nVideo showed rescuers using ladders to help trapped people out of windows. Strong tremors in Taipei forced the subway system to close briefly, although most lines resumed service.\n\nFire authorities said they had already evacuated some 70 people trapped in tunnels near Hualien city, including two Germans.\n\nBut they had lost contact with 50 workers aboard four minibuses heading to a hotel in a national park, Taroko Gorge, they said, and rescuers were looking for them. Another 80 people are trapped in a mining area, though it was not immediately clear if they were inside a mine.\n\nOn a highway through the mountains, huge boulders from a landslide were strewn across the road. The Fire Bureau of Taichung City Government said it rescued a man in his 50s who was unconscious in a truck.\n\n## FIGHTER JETS\n\nA woman who runs bed-and-breakfast accommodation in Hualien city said she scrambled to calm her guests.\n\n\"This is the biggest earthquake I have ever experienced,\" said the woman, who asked to be identified only by her family name, Chan.\n\nThe government put the number of injured at 946.\n\n\"At present the most important thing, the top priority, is to rescue people,\" said President-elect Lai Ching-te, speaking outside one of the collapsed buildings in Hualien.\n\nThe rail link to the area was expected to re-open on Thursday, Lai, who is set to take office next month, said.\n\nThe White House said the U.S. stood ready to provide any assistance necessary.\n\nTaiwan's air force said six F-16 fighter jets had been slightly damaged at a major base in the city from which jets are often scrambled to see off incursions by China's air force, but the aircraft are expected to return to service very soon.\n\nIn Japan, the weather agency put the quake's magnitude at 7.7, saying several small tsunami waves reached parts of the southern prefecture of Okinawa, while downgrading its tsunami warning to an advisory.\n\nIn the Philippines, seismology officials warned coastal residents in several provinces to move to higher ground.\n\nChinese state media said the quake was felt in the southeastern province of Fujian, while a Reuters witness said it was also felt in the commercial hub of Shanghai.\n\n## CHIP SUPPLIES\n\nMost power has been restored after the quake, electricity utility Taipower said, with the island's two nuclear power stations unaffected.\n\nTaiwan's high-speed rail operator said no damage or injuries were reported on its trains, although services would be delayed as it made inspections.\n\nA major supplier of chips to Apple (AAPL.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW), said it had evacuated some fabrication plants and safety systems were operating normally. Nvidia said it expects no supply disruptions from the earthquake.\n\nIt said later its workers were safe and had returned to their workplaces shortly after the earthquake. It said impacted facilities were expected to resume production during the night.\n\nTSMC's Taipei-listed shares ended down 1.3%, but the benchmark index (.TWII) largely brushed off the quake's impact to close down 0.6%.\n\nThe official central news agency said the quake was the biggest since one of magnitude 7.6 in 1999 that killed about 2,400 people and damaged or destroyed 50,000 buildings.\n\nTaiwan weather officials ranked Wednesday's quake in Hualien as \"Upper 6\", or the second-highest level of intensity on a scale ranging from 1 to 7.\n\nSuch quakes collapse walls unless they are made of reinforced concrete blocks, while people cannot stand upright and must crawl in order to move, experts say.\n\nReporting by Yimou Lee and Fabian Hamacher, Shanghai and Hong Kong newsrooms; Writing by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, Chizu Nomiyama, Alison Williams and Josie Kao\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

        "content": "Shakemovie animation showing seismic waves emanating from the magnitude 8.8 Kamchatka Peninsula earthquake.\n\n## USGS releases aftershock forecast for M8.8 Russian Kamchatka Peninsula Earthquake\n\n###\nEstimates indicate a high probability of large aftershocks continuing for weeks\n\nTo learn more about the seismotectonics of the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone, check out our new geonarrative.\n\n### Aftershock Forecasts\n\nFollowing the M8.8 Russian Kamchatka Peninsula Earthquake, the USGS has released new aftershock forecasts that detail the likelihood and magnitude of future earthquakes expected in the region.\n\n*Within the first week* following the magnitude 8.8 event, scientists calculated:\n\n- 2% chance of additional magnitude 8 or larger aftershocks\n- 24% chance of additional magnitude 7 or larger aftershocks\n- 96% chance of additional magnitude 6 or larger aftershocks\n- greater than 99% chance of more magnitude 5 or larger aftershocks\n- greater than 99% chance of more magnitude 4 or larger aftershocks\n- greater than 99% chance of more magnitude 3 or larger aftershocks\n\nThese forecasts prove vital for residents and responders who must remain vigilant and prepared for subsequent tremors that can continue for weeks, months, or even years after a major earthquake. Forecasts will be updated as more information becomes available.\n\n### Event Summary\n\nOn July 29, 2025, at 7:25pm EDT (July 30, 2025, 11:25am local time), a magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck offshore the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia, tying it for the sixth-largest earthquake ever recorded by modern seismic instruments. The massive earthquake triggered Pacific-wide tsunami watches and warnings.\n\nThis historic earthquake was not an isolated event. It followed a 10-day sequence that began with 50 magnitude 5.0 or larger earthquakes, including a magnitude 7.4 earthquake on July 20 and three magnitude 6.6 earthquakes. The sequence remains active as scientists monitor ongoing aftershocks, including M6.9 and M6.2 quakes.\n\nTo learn more about the seismotectonics of the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone, check out our new geonarrative.\n\n### Science in Action: USGS Response Tools\n\nWithin moments of detecting the massive earthquake, a comprehensive suite of monitoring and assessment tools were issued to evaluate its impact and guide emergency response efforts worldwide. These science-based tools, developed through years of research and international collaboration, provide critical information in the crucial hours and days following major seismic events.\n\nScientists at the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) National Earthquake Information Center modeled the extent and timing of rupture, determining that the earthquake tore through an area spanning approximately 300 by 100 miles. The fault slipped up to 30 feet as the rupture took roughly 3.5 minutes to complete its course. Because the earthquake occurred at a shallow 12-mile depth on a subduction plate boundary, the earthquake caused the seafloor to move vertically, displacing water and generating a tsunami threat across the Pacific Basin. The earthquake also caused severe local shaking. Data from the Global Seismographic Network, operated by the USGS and National Science Foundation, was essential to rapidly and accurately estimating the size and extent of the earthquake's rupture in the remote Kamchatka region.\n\n“Rapidly understanding the size, location, and mechanism of the earthquake is crucial for agencies, like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to issue accurate tsunami warnings and for the USGS to estimate the earthquake's shaking-related impacts,\" said USGS seismologist William Yeck.\n\nThe earthquake's shallow depth and oceanic location made it particularly concerning for coastal communities across the Pacific Rim.\n\n\n### PAGER: Rapid Impact Assessment\n\nImmediately following the earthquake, the USGS activated its PAGER system, which provides rapid assessments of likely impact via estimates of the number of fatalities and economic losses. For the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia earthquake, PAGER issued a RED alert for economic losses and a YELLOW alert for fatalities, indicating losses would likely be severe and widespread.\n\n\"Timely data and resources that characterize event details and impacts are among the most effective ways to reduce risk and inform response and recovery efforts,” said Yeck.\n\nThe PAGER system processes information about earthquake size, location, and shaking intensity, combined with population density and building fragility data. This analysis provides aid agencies and government entities with time-critical impact assessments within minutes of an event.\n\n\n### Global Collaboration for Local Impact\n\nThe Global Seismographic Network (GSN) is a permanent digital network of state-of-the-art seismological and geophysical sensors that serves as a resource for monitoring, research, and education. GSN provides near-uniform, worldwide monitoring of the Earth, with approximately 150 modern seismic stations distributed globally.\n\nThe USGS collaborates with seismic networks and agencies worldwide to share data and expertise. This international cooperation enhances the accuracy of earthquake monitoring and hazard assessments, ensuring that critical information reaches communities across the globe.\n\nWorking across international boundaries allows scientists to provide comprehensive monitoring that would be impossible for any single agency to achieve. When earthquakes like the Kamchatka event occur, this collaborative network ensures that data flows quickly to the communities and countries that need it most.\n\n\n### Building Resilience Through Science\n\nThe devastating impact of large earthquakes in populated regions serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of preparedness and scientific monitoring. The USGS continues its mission to detect, locate, and report earthquake events while developing new tools and resources to help communities understand and prepare for seismic hazards.\n\nAs the Kamchatka sequence continues, scientists maintain their vigilant monitoring, providing ongoing updates and analysis. Each earthquake offers new data that improves understanding of seismic processes and enhances the tools used to protect communities worldwide.\n\nThe rapid response to the July 2025 M8.8 Russian earthquake demonstrates how science-based tools can transform devastating natural events into opportunities for learning, preparedness, and ultimately, better protection of communities through improved understanding of our dynamic planet.",

        "content": "# Taiwan hit by strongest earthquake in 25 years; 4 dead and dozens injured: Updates\n\n*Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the Taiwan earthquake for Tuesday, April 2. For the latest news on the quake, please see today's live file for Wednesday, April 3 .*\n\nA powerful 7.4 magnitude earthquake rocked Taiwan on Wednesday, the strongest tremor to hit the island in at least 25 years, killing at least four people, injuring dozens, and sparking nearby Japan to issue a brief evacuation advisory for coastal areas.\n\nThe quake hit shortly before 8 a.m. local time, according to Taiwan's Central Weather Administration. The quake's epicenter was located about 11 miles south of the coastal city of Hualien, about 96 miles southeast of Taipei.\n\nTaiwan's government said four people had died in Hualien County and more than 50 people were injured. At least 26 buildings have collapsed and about 20 people were trapped, according to Taiwan’s national fire agency.\n\nRescue operations are ongoing, and aftershocks have caused residents to flee their homes and remain outside, Taiwan’s official central news agency reported.\n\nFootage from Taiwan television stations showed collapsed buildings in Hualien with some leaning at an angle. Taiwan's Central Weather Administration gave the quake a magnitude of 7.2 while the USGS recorded it at 7.4 with a depth of about 22 miles.\n\nThe United States Geological Survey recorded numerous aftershocks in the same region, including one with a magnitude of 6.5. Taiwan's Central Weather Administration said it recorded more than 25 aftershocks.\n\n## Rescue and recovery efforts underway\n\nThe strong quake rocked Taipei, knocking out power in several parts of the city. Taipower, the state-owned electricity operator, said more than 87,000 homes in Taiwan were still without power.\n\nTaiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen said the military will be deployed to help with rescue and recovery operations.\n\n\"The national military will meet the needs of local governments and provide support to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the citizens,\" she said in a statement posted on Facebook.\n\nTaiwan, Japan, and the Philippines have all canceled their tsunami warnings. The Japan Meteorological Agency had issued a brief evacuation advisory for coastal areas in Okinawa, where several small tsunami waves were reported.\n\nThere was no tsunami threat to Hawaii or the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. And no tsunami threat was expected for the west coast of North America, the U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center said.\n\nChinese state media reported that the quake was felt in several cities in the Fujian province, a coastal province in southeastern China. The Taipei city government said there were no immediate reports of damage and the city's metro system was up and running soon after.\n\nThe quake was the largest to hit the island since 1999 when a 7.6 magnitude tremor killed around 2,400 people, according to Taiwan’s official central news agency. The island is regularly hit by earthquakes due to its location in the \"Ring of Fire,\" a path of active volcanoes and sites of seismic activity in the Pacific Ocean where a majority of earthquakes occur.\n\n*Contributing: Reuters*",

        "content": "# Horrified commuters thrown around train, child rescued from collapsed building as 7.4-magnitude earthquake kills 7, injures 700 in Taiwan\n\nAt least seven people were killed and more than 700 people injured when a powerful 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck Taiwan early Wednesday.\n\nThe quake, which rocked the island just before 8 a.m. local time, downed buildings in Taiwan’s eastern city of Hualien and caused a small tsunami on the coast of Japan’s Yonaguni island, officials said.\n\nThe deaths were reported in Hualien, which was the epicenter of the earthquake — the strongest one to hit Taiwan in 25 years, according to the country’s fire department.\n\nAt least three of the dead were believed to have been crushed to death by rocks falling from the mountainside.\n\nMore than 50 were injured, according to the country’s fire department.\n\nLocal media showed buildings in Hualien knocked off their foundations after the quake struck as people were heading to work and school.\n\nAt least 26 buildings collapsed with 20 people trapped inside as rescue efforts are underway, the fire department said.\n\nShocking footage of the aftermath posted on social media shows massive buildings dramatically leaning at an extreme angle as clouds of dust hang in the air.\n\nAnother clip shows straphangers aboard the Taipei Metro gripping onto poles and their seats as the quake rocks the train car from side to side.\n\nThe earthquake caused several parts of the capital city, Taipei, to lose power, while train service was temporarily suspended across the country. However, things appeared to return to normal with people commuting to work and children heading to school shortly after the quake.\n\nJapan issued an evacuation advisory for coastal areas near Okinawa after the earthquake triggered a tsunami warning.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency forecast a tsunami of up to 9.8 feet for the southern island group of Okinawa. Japan’s Self-Defense Force deployed aircraft to gather more information about the tsunami’s impact in the region and started preparing shelters for evacuees if needed.\n\nA wave about 1 foot high was reported on the coast of Yonaguni island roughly 15 minutes after the quake struck. JAMA said waves likely also hit the coasts of Miyako and Yaeyama islands, though the 1-foot wave was believed to be the tallest.\n\nThe tsunami warning was downgraded in Japan and canceled in the Philippines a couple of hours later after both countries determined the threat had passed.\n\nSeveral aftershocks shook Taiwan after the initial quake, including one that measured 6.5 magnitude.\n\nThe US National Tsunami Warning Center said it was “analyzing the event to determine the level of danger” for Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California and British Columbia. It later determined that there was no threat.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami threat to Hawaii or the US Pacific territory of Guam as well.\n\nTaiwan’s earthquake monitoring agency gave the magnitude as 7.2 while the US Geological Survey put it at 7.4.\n\nThe depth of the quake was measured at 21 miles below the surface. The quake was believed to be the biggest in Taiwan since 1999, when a major 7.7-magnitude tremor caused extensive damage on the island and killed 2,400 people.\n\nIn 2019, a magnitude-6.2 quake hit near Hualien and killed at least 17 people and injured more than 300 others.\n\n*With Post wires*",

        "content": "Less than two months after a magnitude 8.8 earthquake rocked Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula, another strong earthquake occurred early on September 19 local time.\n\nAlthough tsunami waves have been observed closer to the earthquake’s epicenter off Kamchatka’s eastern coast, shortly before 5 P.M. EDT, officials at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center announced an “all clear” for Hawaii, ruling out the possibility of giant waves crossing the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey made an initial estimate of the new earthquake’s magnitude as 7.8, meaning that the July 29 event released more than 30 times the energy of this one and produced waves with about 10 times the magnitude of the latter. (The scale by which scientists measure earthquakes is logarithmic, not linear.)\n\n## On supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nThe July event was among the 10 strongest earthquakes on record; this new temblor won’t make that cut. According to Reuters, the Kamchatka region’s governor said that there have been no reports of damage from the recent event in the sparsely populated region.\n\nUSGS has already confirmed that the magnitude 7.8 event is an aftershock of the earlier earthquake, making it the latter quake’s largest aftershock to date. Both earthquakes occurred on the Kuril-Kamchatka plate boundary, which stretches from northern Japan, along the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, toward the Aleutian Islands. Here, the Pacific plate is sinking under the North American plate, making the region one of the world’s most seismically active, according to USGS.\n\nThe July earthquake spurred concerns of a serious tsunami but ended up not producing such a phenomenon because of local geology.\n\nIf you live in Hawaii or along the western coast of the U.S. when a tsunami risk is declared, monitor tsunami alerts from the federal government and follow the directives of local emergency response personnel.",

        "content": "For now, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has appointed Raisi’s first vice president, Mohammad Mokhber, as interim president. Mokhber had close ties to the supreme leader and to the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) but was not viewed as a potential contender for the presidency.\n\nUSIP’s Garrett Nada looks at what this could mean for Iran’s foreign policy amid regional tumult, Raisi’s domestic and foreign policy legacy and the implications for Khamenei’s looming succession.\n\n### How could Raisi’s death impact Iran’s foreign policy amid various crises in the Middle East?\n\nRaisi’s death will not significantly alter the course of Iran’s foreign policy in the near-term. Foreign policy is not under the exclusive purview of the president. The Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) is the highest body in charge of foreign policy and national security. As chair of the council, the president can influence debates and play a role in setting the agenda. But the president still must work to form consensus with 11 other permanent members with high-ranking military, political or ministerial positions. Ultimately, SNSC decisions must be approved by the supreme leader.\n\nThe domestic disorder, however, may have a chilling effect. To ensure a smooth transition of power, Iran may refrain from new rounds of escalation with Israel or other adversaries until a new president is sworn in. It may delay new diplomatic initiatives given that the foreign minister was also killed. One of Mokhber’s first moves, however, was to appoint Ali Bagheri Kani, the deputy foreign minister for political affairs, as acting foreign minister.\n\nBagheri Kani had been the lead nuclear negotiator under Raisi, although the hardliner was a vocal critic of the 2015 nuclear deal. In mid-May 2024, Bagheri Kani reportedly held indirect talks with Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, on deescalating regional tensions. But a meeting between Bagheri Kani and EU officials scheduled for May 22 was reportedly canceled after the helicopter crash.\n\n### What was President Raisi’s legacy? What were his notable domestic policies?\n\nRaisi’s presidency may be most closely linked with the brutal crackdown on nationwide protests that broke out in September 2022 over the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman detained by the morality police for improper hijab. Protesters chanted “Woman, Life, Freedom” and “Death to the Dictator,” a reference to Khamenei. The protests, driven by Iran’s Gen Z, lasted for more than three months and were the most significant since the 2009 Green Movement. Security forces reportedly killed more than 500 people, including minors, and detained more than 22,000. Raisi, a vocal proponent of the Islamic dress code, was unwilling to compromise on enforcement.\n\nA hardline cleric born in 1960, Raisi was not a popular figure even before the protests. He was not a career politician and did not have an independent base of supporters. Before his presidency, Raisi was best known for his role in the so-called “death commission” that ordered the extrajudicial executions of between 4,000 and 5,000 political prisoners in 1988. Raisi, a 28-year-old prosecutor at the time, was reportedly one of the four members of the commission that planned and organized the massacre.\n\nFor years, Raisi climbed the ranks of the judiciary. But he did not start to gain national name recognition until 2016, when Khamenei appointed him to head one of Iran’s wealthiest religious endowments. In 2017, Raisi ran for president and came in second, losing to incumbent centrist Hassan Rouhani. Khamenei appointed Raisi Iran’s chief justice in 2019. The United States sanctioned him that year for his involvement in domestic repression.\n\nRaisi won the 2021 presidential election with 62 percent of the vote, although the majority did not bother to cast ballots. The turnout, just 48.8 percent, was the lowest for a presidential election in the history of the Islamic Republic. The victory was also hollow given that Raisi faced no serious competitors due to vetting by the powerful Guardian Council.\n\nOn the economy, Raisi pledged to fight corruption, build one million affordable housing units per year, create one million jobs per year, control prices of goods, and reduce inflation. But he made limited progress on those goals in part due to stringent U.S. sanctions but also due to mismanagement. In 2022, his administration botched an attempt to reform subsidies for basic imports, including wheat, triggering a spike in bread prices and protests. The government did manage to bring inflation down to 35 percent by February 2024, the lowest level in two years, but still fell short of Raisi’s goal of 30 percent. Increased oil production and sales — more than policy reforms — were responsible for GDP growth of 3.8 percent in 2022 and 4.7 percent in 2023. In 2024, everyday Iranians struggled to deal with high prices, a weak currency, high unemployment and cuts in state social services.\n\n### What were President Raisi’s major foreign policy accomplishments and failures?\n\nWhen Raisi took office in 2021, he had virtually no foreign policy experience. Early on, he backed negotiations to restore U.S. and Iranian compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. He doubled down on Iran’s pivot east, which hardliners had long advocated. Raisi outlined two main priorities: improving relations with neighbors, and expanding ties with Asian powers, including China and Russia. His administration made progress on both fronts but failed to revive the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\n**Russia: **Iran’s support for Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine led to unprecedented military and economic cooperation. Iran became Russia’s top military backer by providing more than 1,000 Shahed series suicide drones as well as artillery and tank rounds. The two also forged new economic links in the face of U.S. sanctions. Russia overtook China as the largest foreign investor in the Islamic Republic.\n**China: **Raisi prioritized deepening ties with China, Iran’s top trade partner and an economic lifeline. In 2023, Raisi became the first Iranian leader to make a formal state visit to Beijing in more than 20 years, signing 20 agreements that could be worth billions of dollars. In 2023, Iranian oil exports were up by 50 percent, a five-year high, at 1.29 million barrels per day. The vast majority of exports eventually went to China, often through intermediaries.\n\n\nUnder Raisi, Iran joined two economic blocs that brought it closer to China and Russia. In July 2023, Iran was formally admitted as the ninth member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a security and economic organization led by China and Russia that also includes Central and South Asian countries. In January 2024, Iran became a member of the BRICS bloc of emerging economies — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Together, the five nations represented approximately a quarter of the world’s economy and more than 40 percent of the world’s population.\n**Saudi Arabia:** Last March, Iran and regional rival Saudi Arabia agreed to a China-brokered deal to restore diplomatic ties seven years after severing relations. The Islamic Republic and the Gulf kingdom affirmed their respect for the “sovereignty of states” and “non-interference in internal affairs.” For years, the two countries have clashed over regional conflicts, particularly Syria and Yemen.\n**Afghanistan: **Raisi took office just as the Taliban made significant territorial gains in Afghanistan, with which Iran shares a 572-mile border. He hailed the U.S. withdrawal and adopted a policy of cautious engagement with the Sunni movement amid the chaos. He and other officials urged the Taliban to form a government that reflects Afghanistan’s political, religious and ethnic diversity. Iran has not formally recognized Taliban rule even as it dealt with Kabul on a day-to-day basis. Border clashes occasionally broke out, but the two countries avoided open conflict despite a long-standing dispute over water rights.\n**Nuclear Deal:** Raisi’s government failed to resuscitate the 2015 nuclear deal with world’s six major powers — Britain, China, Germany, France, Russia and the United States. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimposed U.S. sanctions. The Biden administration launched a diplomatic initiative in April 2021 — led by the European Union — but it collapsed in August 2022 when Tehran balked at the final terms. The lifting of U.S. sanctions would have been a significant economic boon to Iran’s economy. But Raisi’s government appeared to abandon the prospect of improving relations with the West as Tehran increasingly pivoted, in trade and military ties, to China and Russia. Iran exceeded key limits on its nuclear activities and limited U.N. inspector access to its facilities.\n\n### What are the implications for Iran's politics and governance amid questions over the succession of Supreme Leader Khamenei?\n\nRaisi’s death added further uncertainty to a moment of transition. Iran’s new Parliament, elected in March with runoffs in May, is set to select a new speaker later in May. Incumbent Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, a mainstream conservative, could face challenges from three other men.\n\nThe government also faced a legitimacy crisis following elections for Parliament and the Assembly of Experts in March 2024. The turnout was 41 percent, the lowest since the 1979 revolution. Iranians will probably not be interested in voting in the June 28 election unless the Guardian Council allows a more diverse pool of candidates, not just hardliners, to run.\n\nPolitical factions were already preparing for the eventual transition of power given that Supreme Leader Khamenei turned 85 in April 2024. Several power centers, including the IRGC and the Office of the Supreme Leader, will want to influence the succession.\n\nNo obvious successor has emerged, although Raisi was widely speculated to be in the running. Mojtaba Khamenei, the supreme leader’s 55-year-old son, is also thought to be a contender, although he has never held an official position and has lackluster religious credentials. His selection would also run counter to the principles of the 1979 revolution that overthrew a hereditary monarchy.\n\nMojtaba, however, has close connections to the IRGC and the Basij paramilitary, which may have significant influence over the succession. The IRGC has not only eclipsed Iran’s conventional military, the Artesh, it has also emerged as a key economic player. It controls a vast network of companies involved in arms, energy, construction, telecommunications, mining and many other sectors. The IRGC would stand to gain if the next supreme leader depends on it for support.\n\nPHOTO: The late President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran at a press at U.N. headquarters in New York on Wednesday, Sept. 20, 2023.

        "content": "Two people were killed Monday evening when a Socata TBM-700 crashed during an approach to Monroe Municipal Airport (KEFT), a non-towered field in southern Wisconsin. The aircraft, registered as N700PT to a Santa Barbara, California, owner, went down at around 5:15 p.m.\n\n## Initial response and scene conditions\n\nGreen County Deputies told local news outlet WMTV that the turboprop impacted a gravel quarry north of the airport, where arriving crews found burning construction equipment and large sections of aircraft debris.\n\nAccording to ADS-B data, the TBM departed Wisconsin’s Oshkosh-Wittman Regional Airport (KOSH) at about 4:40 p.m. for the short flight to Monroe. ADS-B tracking appeared to show the airplane on approach to Runway 20 before the crash.\n\nMETAR data from around the time of the accident included quarter-mile visibility with fog and an overcast ceiling at 300 feet. As the aircraft neared the north side of State Highway 59, ADS-B data showed the aircraft initiated a climb roughly a quarter mile from the runway. It ultimately turned toward the northeast before coming to rest at the gravel quarry.\n\nAlthough the aircraft appeared to be on a final approach path for Runway 20, KEFT only has published approach procedures for Runways 12 and 30. These include RNAV approaches for Runways 12 and 30, as well as a VOR/DME for Runway 30. ADS-B data does appear to show the aircraft was initially on the approach for Runway 12, before initiating a left turn toward the north and then circling back south toward runway 20.\n\n## Ongoing investigation\n\nLocal fire departments from Monroe Rural and Juda responded to extinguish the post-impact fire.\n\nOfficials have not released the names of those on board. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the Wisconsin plane crash, with the NTSB noting in a post on X that it opened an inquiry into the crash. The aircraft, manufactured in 2003 and powered by a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-64 engine, was destroyed in the accident.\n\nAnother TBM-700 flight resulted in a fatal crash in Massachusetts last month.\n\nFirst of all my condolences to the families affected.\n\nThat said, we as GA pilots have to do better. Looking at the approach plates for EFT, there are no approaches with less than 400 feet minimums and 1 mile visibility. And there is no vertical guidance on any approach.\n\nWhile part 91 has the right to do a ‘look see,’ are we really considering an approach with weather reported below minimums? Are we mentally prepped for a missed approach?\n\nNot going to say I have never done the look see, but, I was prepped for a missed and a divert. Best we all adopt this state of mind.\n\nI have flown over quarries before. Always in good weather, because I’m a VFR pilot. They can be every bit as bad as mountain flying, with unexpected updrafts and down drafts, depending on the wind conditions. I’m not saying that this had anything to do with the accident, but it could certainly have been a contributor.\n\nI don’t agree with Matt’s assessment at all. The ADS-B track log data on FlightAware doesn’t show anything that looks like turning to Runway 20. On the contrary, it looks like a normal approach to Runway 12, an attempted missed approach, and a loss of control (overrotation? airspeed drops precipitously while altitude increases rapidly) upon initiating the climb. Spatial disorientation?\n\nFlight Track Log N700PT 24-Nov-2025 (KOSH-KEFT) - FlightAware\n\nYes, condolences to the family. Appears they should have gone back to Wittman Field, Oshkosh. Over confidence in actual fog appears to be the cause. Not tracking everything going on and loosing control - spacial disorientation as stated by others.\n\nTotally agree (except that it’s rwy 12, not 13–not a big deal). I can’t figure out, given the very graphic ADS-B data, how he could surmise that they were trying an approach to rwy 22.\n\nThe missed approach procedure for that approach calls for a straight out climb to 3000 feet to a waypoint, followed by a turn to the southeast. ADS-B shows him turning northeast almost immediately after starting the miss, so whatever happened, he was not following the charted missed procedure.\n\nIt also appears the instrument approaches are to Runways 12 and 30. Is there a typo in the article?\n\nWell, yes he didn’t fly the published missed path, but the track log seems to show the aircraft departed controlled flight almost immediately upon initiation of the climbout. That would explain the\n\napparentfailure to climb straight ahead, which the pilot may well have been trying to do but lost control in the process.No, I did that one all by myself.\n\nLooks like a torque roll to me on the missed approach. The TBM’s will do that with lazy feet and too much power applied too fast! Just my two cents\n\nThe ADS-B data appears to me as though it may be consistent with the charted Rwy 12 RNAV approach. The ground speed decreases throughout the final approach segment until reaching an ADS-B altitude of 1,500’ and 109 knots GS. At this point on the approach, the ADS-B altitude was indicated as 1,500’, the MDA for the straight-in to rwy 12. The circling mins on the IAP is charted only a little higher than the straight-in mins and the ADS-B target appears to maneuver to the North, perhaps consistent with circling for rwy 20. If the airport environment were spotted near the point where the change in course occurred and at 1,500’ MSL, (400’ HAA) it may have required a steeper than normal descent to land on the first third of Rwy 12 and could have acted as a trigger for the pilot to attempt to circle to Rwy 12.\n\nObviously this scenario is just armchair speculation after the fact, (MMQBing) but the data appears as though it may be consistent with the scenario as presented.\n\nManeuvering at or near minimum circling MDAs is perhaps some of the most difficult and challenging flying that can be done under IFR. The transition from instrument to visual control has been a factor in a great many low altitude loss of control accidents.\n\nPlease plan, brief and fly safely\n\n(post deleted by author)\n\nHello;\n\nMy friend was involved in this crash as a passenger. The information that I was told from pilots close with him is that this was a new plane his friend had purchased. They did a miss approach and then something happened with the power and autopilot. The plane had a turbo prop thus the plane naturally went to the left.\n\nI am deeply saddened by this as I was planning on seeing him today. I wish my friend did not go flying that day. I now will not see him at the EAA airshow this year\n\nThis accident saddens me, too, as I had been with these two guys just two weeks ago at the OSH QB meeting. I’ll miss them. RIP.",

        "content": "Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian died in a helicopter crash, state media reported Monday.\n\n\"All the passengers of the helicopter carrying the Iranian president and foreign minister were martyred,\" semi-official news agency Mehr News had reported earlier.\n\nRaisi was returning after inaugurating a dam on Iran's common border with the Azerbaijan Republic, when his helicopter crashed upon landing in northern Iran's Varzaqan region on Sunday evening local time, according to state news agency IRNA.\n\nMembers of the president's entourage, including Governor of East Azarbaijan Malek Rahmati, and the crew also died, the semi-official Tasnim News Agency reported.\n\nThe president's convoy included three helicopters, two of which landed safely, according to Tasnim.\n\nCommunication with Raisi's chopper was cut off about half an hour into the flight, Iran's Vice President for Executive Affairs Mohsen Mansouri said. Raisi was travelling to Tabriz city to launch an oil project.\n\nInclement weather conditions and difficult terrain had hampered search and rescue operations, Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps' chief Pirhossein Koulivand, reportedly said.\n\nDrone footage published on state media FARS News Agency showed the chopper's wreckage on a steep hillside.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed condolences on social media platform X, saying Raisi's \"contribution to strengthening India-Iran bilateral relationship will always be remembered.\"\n\nVenezuela's president Nicolás Maduro called Raisi an \"extraordinary leader.\"\n\nFormer Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif also condoled the death of the president and others in the crash.\n\n\"The consequences of this are probably going to be rather contained,\" Ali Ahmadi, executive fellow at the Geneva Center for Security Policy, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia.\"\n\nPresident Raisi was a fairly marginal figure in national security decision, said Ahmadi, adding that Iranian foreign policy is principally governed by the Office of the Supreme Leader and the Iranian military.\n\nRaisi, 63, a hardline, conservative politician was elected president in 2021 after failing to get into the office in 2017. He was seen as a contender to succeed supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei.\n\nAs president, he cracked down on dissent at home.\n\n*Correction: An earlier version of this story included an incorrect reference to the number of people that had died.*",

Lanes were finally reopened to traffic just before 5 p.m.\n\nThe accident happened near the 162 mile marker on the far south end of the parish. Authorities confirmed the crash resulted in at least one fatality.\n\nThe first crash happened when an 18-wheeler overturned and a chain reaction of crashes followed, including a pickup truck that ran into the rear of another 18-wheeler.\n\nTwo DeSoto sheriff's deputies who responded to the crash shared an image from their dash cameras showing visibility at zero.\n\nThe Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development closed I-49 northbound lanes immediately following the crash.\n\nMotorists were strongly cautioned to avoid the interstate as the closure is expected to cause significant traffic delays throughout the morning commute.",

        "content": "TOWN OF SHEBOYGAN FALLS — Three separate crashes occurred on State Highway 23 in Sheboygan Falls on Thursday morning after a 79-year-old driver made an illegal U-turn, according to the Sheboygan County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nHeavy fog contributed to the crashes, with visibility along the highway severely limited to less than a tenth of a mile around 7:30 a.m.\n\n**Watch: Driver causes multiple crashes in heavy fog on STHY 23 in Sheboygan Falls**\n\n\"I wanna say a couple of feet,\" a witness described the visibility conditions.\n\nThe sheriff’s office said a 79-year-old female driver from Sheboygan caused a chain reaction after making an illegal U-turn on Sunset Road in front of a 19-year-old man who was driving east.\n\nThe crash then caused a chain-reaction collision involving five more vehicles and sent a 22-year-old man from Plymouth to the hospital with life-threatening injuries.\n\nA 37-year-old woman from Glenbeulah was also taken to the hospital with serious injuries, and her two juvenile passengers were taken to the hospital but are expected to be okay.\n\n\"I just saw a bunch of cars and police cars out there with the lights over in this direction,\" said Jackie Zais, who works across the street from the crash site at Moraine Builders. \"There was a cattle truck down there.\"\n\nZais said she didn’t immediately notice the accident scene because it was obscured by the heavy fog.\n\n\"I live in Manitowoc County, and I take the back roads coming in. And it was getting foggier as I got to Sheboygan County,\" Zais said.\n\nThe sheriff’s office said two other crashes were also reported, with fog contributing to the crash, as well as vehicles slowing down due to the initial crash. An additional crash happened just west of the initial crash, with no injuries reported.\n\nShortly after, another crash was reported on STH 23 eastbound, east of Bridgewood Road, involving eight cars and injuring two people.\n\nThe sheriff’s office emphasized the importance of driving with headlights on and reducing speed during unsafe weather conditions — a sentiment Zais also shared.\n\n\"People need to drive with their headlights on. I mean, I came across a few with no headlights on,\" Zais said. \"On a foggy day and rainy day, you've got to put them on.\"\n\nThe 79-year-old driver will be cited for her failure to yield the right of way causing injury, with the crashes still under investigation, according to the sheriff’s office.\n\n*It’s about time to watch on your time.

        "content": "Supported by\n\n# What We Know About the Helicopter Crash That Killed Iran’s President\n\nThe deaths of two of Iran’s most high-profile leaders — President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian — come at a tumultuous time for the country.\n\nThe deaths of Iran’s president, Ebrahim Raisi, and foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, in a helicopter crash have left one of the Middle East’s most powerful and disruptive nations at a critical moment.\n\nHere’s a look at what we know about the crash and its potential implications.\n\n## What happened?\n\nMr. Raisi, 63, and Mr. Amir Abdollahian were traveling back from Iran’s border with Azerbaijan after inaugurating a joint dam project when their helicopter went down in a remote and mountainous area around 1 p.m. local time on Sunday, according to state media.\n\nSearch and rescue teams battled rain and heavy fog to scour the mountains and dense forest for more than 10 hours, looking for the crash site. The authorities called off the aerial search at one point because of the weather, dispatching elite commandos of the Revolutionary Guards and others on foot.\n\nState television urged the public to pray for the safety of Mr. Raisi and his delegation as the rescue effort — which involved about 2,000 people — stretched through the night.\n\nSearch teams found the helicopter on Monday morning as daylight broke, and broadcasts on state television showed images of burning debris. There were no survivors.\n\nThe helicopter crashed because of a “technical failure,” the IRNA state news agency said in an article paying tribute to Mr. Raisi. It appeared to be the first time a cause of the crash was indicated. Some Iran observers suggested that decades of international sanctions, which have caused the country’s aviation fleet to atrophy, might have played a role.\n\n## Who are the victims?\n\nMr. Raisi, a hard-line cleric who came of age during the country’s Islamic revolution, was the second most powerful person in Iran’s political structure after the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nFollowing his ascent to the presidency in 2021, Mr. Raisi consolidated power and marginalized reformists. He expanded Iran’s regional influence, backing proxies across the Middle East, and oversaw a deadly crackdown on domestic protesters.\n\nMr. Amir Abdollahian was a career diplomat and, like Mr. Raisi, a hard-liner. He was seen as closely aligned with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps and was also believed to have had a close relationship with Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the powerful leader of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, whom the United States killed in a drone strike in 2020.\n\nThe IRNA news agency reported that in addition to Mr. Raisi and Mr. Amir Abdollahian, those killed included Malek Rahmati, the governor of East Azerbaijan Province, and Mehdi Mousavi, the head of Mr. Raisi’s security team. The agency said that Mohammad Ali Al-e-Hashem, the local representative of the supreme leader, was also with them but did not name the crew of the aircraft.\n\n## What happens now?\n\nThe Iranian authorities have appeared eager to project a sense of order and control.\n\nAyatollah Khamenei — who had said there would be “no disruption” to the government’s work — issued a statement offering his condolences and announcing five days of public mourning.\n\nHe said that Iran’s first vice president, Mohammad Mokhber, would take over managing the government and would work with the heads of the legislature and judiciary to hold elections for a new president within 50 days. A conservative political operative, Mr. Mokhber has been involved in business conglomerates closely tied to the supreme leader.\n\nTo fill the hole left by the death of Mr. Amir Abdollahian, Iran’s cabinet appointed one of his deputies, Ali Bagheri Kani, as the foreign ministry’s “caretaker,” the IRNA state news agency reported. Mr. Bagheri Kani has served as Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator and was involved in the deal last year that freed imprisoned Americans in exchange for several jailed Iranians and eventual access to about $6 billion in Iranian funds.\n\nA public funeral procession for Iran’s president and foreign minister will be held in the northwestern city of Tabriz on Tuesday morning, according to the country’s interior minister, Ahmad Vahidi. He said the bodies would then be taken to Tehran for an official funeral.\n\n## Are there broader implications?\n\nThe death of Mr. Raisi, a conservative who violently crushed dissent, comes during a particularly tumultuous period for Iran.\n\nIts long shadow war with Israel burst into the open after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, setting off a war in Gaza and a cascade of strikes and counterstrikes across the region. The hostilities became even more pronounced after Israel killed a number of senior Iranian commanders in a strike on an Iranian Embassy compound in Syria last month. Iran retaliated with its first direct attack on Israel after decades of enmity.\n\nThe future of Iran’s nuclear program is another crucial issue. Iran has produced nuclear fuel enriched to a level just short of what would be needed to produce several bombs. Just last week, Mr. Amir Abdollahian met with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, who was demanding better access to Iran’s sprawling nuclear facilities.\n\nDomestically, Iran is also facing widespread discontent, with many residents calling for an end to clerical rule. Corruption and sanctions have gutted the economy, stoking frustrations. In the last two years, the country has witnessed a domestic uprising, the Iranian currency plunging to a record low, water shortages intensified by climate change and the deadliest terrorist attack since the 1979 founding of the Islamic Republic.\n\n## Will Mr. Raisi’s death have a big impact?\n\nSome analysts said they did not expect Mr. Raisi’s death to herald a major change in Iran’s international agenda, since the nation’s supreme leader is responsible for setting the country’s policies and the president’s power comes from enacting those decisions.\n\n“At one level, the outcome does not portend a sea change in how Iran formulates and acts upon its interests abroad,” said Ali Vaez, the Iran director at the International Crisis Group.\n\nHowever, Mr. Raisi’s unexpected death could change the political calculus within Iran, analysts said.\n\n“The trouble for the regime is that a crash will unsettle the political environment,” said Afshon Ostovar, an associate professor of national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in California. “That could spark political infighting inside the regime, especially behind the scenes.”\n\n## What has the reaction been?\n\nMr. Raisi’s political rivals, some of whom had vocally criticized his rule, issued statements of condolence, including the grandson of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. “The Islamic Republic of Iran has faced many very difficult situations since its inception and has overcome them,” said the grandson, Hassan Khomeini.\n\nMessages also poured in from world leaders. Among them were President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia — who called Mr. Raisi a “wonderful person” and a “true friend of Russia” — and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan.\n\nCharles Michel, the president of the European Union, said that the European Union expressed its “sincere condolences” — a message that raised some eyebrows given the bloc’s fraught relationship with Iran.\n\nLeily Nikounazar, Anushka Patil, Erika Solomon and Matina Stevis-Gridneff contributed reporting.\n\nFarnaz Fassihi is the United Nations bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the organization, and also covers Iran and the shadow war between Iran and Israel. She is based in New York.\n\n## Related Content\n\nAdvertisement",

According to the Iowa State Patrol, deputies were dispatched at approximately 7:29 a.m. for a two-vehicle accident located near the intersection of Union Avenue and 390th Street. A 2013 Dodge Ram, driven by 47-year-old Jeremy Fank of Carroll was traveling northbound on Union Avenue and attempted to pass a semi-tractor trailer. A 2025 Toyota Camry, operated by 90-year-old Roy Russom of Wall Lake was southbound on Union Avenue and was struck when both vehicles tried taking evasive action swerving to the west ditch to avoid each other. Both vehicles came to a rest in the west ditch. Russom was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities say dense fog was present which was a contributing factor to the crash. The Iowa State Patrol was assisted at the scene by the Sac County Sheriff’s Office and the Lake View Police Department.",

The extent of any injuries was not immediately released.\n\nThe crash occurred in the northbound lanes, Volk said, forcing the diversion of northbound traffic to one lane. He urged drivers to follow directions given by first responders in the area.\n\nVolk said dense fog was creating hazardous driving conditions. Motorists should use extreme caution in foggy conditions, he added.\n\nFirst responders also were called to the scene of a four-vehicle accident at the intersection of Highway 35 and 563rd Avenue near Hoskins in Wayne County around 5:50 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nSgt. Scott Rutten with the Nebraska State Patrol said the accident involved two semis and two pickups, one of which was pulling a livestock trailer. Nobody was transported to the hospital, according to Rutten, who said the crash was weather-related. The scene was cleared by 8 a.m.\n\nStanton County Sheriff Mike Unger and Pierce County Sheriff Rick Eberhardt said their respective counties had not dealt with any fog-related accidents as of 9 a.m. Wednesday, but conditions were dangerous. Unger said he had spoken to a courthouse employee who described the drive from Woodland Park to Stanton as “treacherous.”\n\nThe Stanton County sheriff urged motorists to use caution and turn their headlights on when it is foggy.\n\nThe Cedar County Sheriff’s Office shared on Facebook that visibility also was significantly reduced there because of fog. The sheriff’s office said automatic lights won’t turn on in daylight when it’s foggy, so drivers need to manually turn their lights on.\n\nThe National Weather Service had placed several counties in eastern Nebraska in a dense fog advisory until 10 a.m. Wednesday. Visibility, according to the weather service, was a quarter-mile or less in some areas.\n\n“If driving, slow down, use your headlights and leave plenty of distance ahead of you,” the weather service’s advisory stated.\n\nSOUTH YANKTON— The Santee Sioux Nation announced that the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, has finalized the acquisition of title to around five acres of land located on Highway 81 in South Yankton in trust for the nation.\n\nWAYNE — The Wayne State College brass and percussion ensembles will present a concert abundant in splendor, tradition and holiday spirit at 7:30 p.m. Monday, Dec. 1, in Ramsey Theatre, located in the Peterson Fine Arts Building.

        "content": "# Iran's president has died in a helicopter crash, state media reports\n\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi, the country's foreign minister and other officials were declared dead from a helicopter crash, Iranian state media said on Monday.\n\nThe Iranian government held an emergency meeting following the announcement of Raisi's death and afterward Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, named First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber as acting president. Khamenei also announced five days of mourning would take place in the country.\n\nThe crash left Iran without two of its most pivotal diplomatic figures as regional tensions remain high from the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIranian state-run media announced Raisi's death in a post on Monday, along with the deaths of Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, the governor of Iran's East Azerbaijan province and other government officials who were aboard the helicopter.\n\nNo immediate cause for the crash was provided, but state media released images online showing what it called was the wreckage from the helicopter the group was traveling in. The helicopter crashed in foggy conditions in a mountainous area in northern Iran as they returned from an event along Iran's border with Azerbaijan.\n\nImmediate international reaction came from Iran's neighbors. Pakistan's government announced it would observe a day of mourning over the news. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin sent his condolences to Khamenei, Russian state media reported.\n\n### Rescue teams searched intensely for the helicopter\n\nEarlier, IRNA reported that the president of the Iranian Red Crescent Society confirmed that rescue and search teams had identified Raisi's helicopter.\n\nOn Sunday, Iran's Interior Minister, Ahmad Vahidi, said a \"hard landing\" of the president's helicopter and said the search-and-rescue operation were underway, according to IRNA.\n\nIRNA reportedthat two passengers on the flight had communicated with rescue workers. Twenty rescue teams, including drones and dogs, had been sent to the scene, and the Iranian military had also deployed troops to assist in the rescue effort, IRNA added.\n\nThe Fars News Agency posted what it said was video footage of rescue teams that had been dispatched to the area. Earlier in the day, the Iranian government's X account posted an image of Raisi seated next to Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, at the opening of a dam along the border between the two countries.\n\n### Raisi was elected in 2021 and is a relative hard-liner\n\nA former cleric and judge, Raisi was elected president in 2021.\n\nWhen he came into office, Raisi said Iran would continue to honor its nuclear deal with the U.S., despite then-President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the agreement in 2018.\n\nStill, Raisi has been viewed as more of a hard-liner than his predecessor, former Iranian president Hassan Rouhani.\n\nLast month, Raisi celebrated Iran's attack on Israel following an airstrike in Damascus that killed seven members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Iran blamed Israel for the bombing, but Israel never claimed responsibility. Israel said it and its allies intercepted 99% of the missiles and drones Iran fired during its retaliatory strike.\n\nIran's president is the head of its government, but the country is ruled by Khamenei, its supreme leader.\n\nIran's supreme leader sets national policies and supervises their implementation and also controls the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and police force, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nIran's constitution dictates that if the president dies while in office, the first vice president takes over with the approval of the country's supreme leader, Reuters reported. A new election must then be held within 50 days.",

        "content": "The death of president Ebrahim Raisi must not deny people in Iran their right to justice, truth and reparation for the litany of crimes under international law and human rights violations committed since the 1980s during his time in the echelons of power, said Amnesty International today, following his passing in a helicopter crash in East Azerbaijan province.\n\nEbrahim Raisi, who at the age of 20 was appointed as Prosecutor General of Karaj, Alborz province, in 1980, quickly rose through the ranks to assume various senior judicial and executive positions, before becoming president in 2021. Over the past 44 years, he was directly involved in or oversaw the enforced disappearance and extrajudicial executions of thousands of political dissidents in the 1980s, the unlawful killing, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and torture of thousands of protesters; and violent persecution of women and girls defying compulsory veiling, among other serious human rights violations.\n\n“Ebrahim Raisi should have been criminally investigated, including for the crimes against humanity of murder, enforced disappearance and torture, while he was alive. His death must not rob his victims and their families of their right to truth and to see all others complicit in his crimes held to account,” said Diana Eltahawy, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.\n\n“For decades, perpetrators bearing criminal responsibility have enjoyed the systematic impunity that prevails in Iran. The international community must act now to establish pathways to accountability for victims of crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations committed by Ebrahim Raisi and other Iranian officials.”\n\nThe international community must act now to establish pathways to accountability for victims of crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations committed by Ebrahim Raisi and other Iranian officials.\n\nDiana Eltahawy, Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa\n\n**Involvement in the 1988 prisoner massacres**\n\nIn 1988, Ebrahim Raisi was a member of the “death commission” which carried out the ongoing enforced disappearance and extrajudicial executions of several thousand political dissidents in Evin prison in Tehran and Gohardasht prison in Alborz province between late July and early September 1988. Since then, survivors and victims’ families have been cruelly denied truth, justice and reparation for decades and faced persecution for seeking accountability.\n\nIn May 2018, Ebrahim Raisi publicly defended the mass killings describing the massacres as “one of the proud achievements of the [Islamic Republic] system”.\n\nIn a November 2018 report, Amnesty International called for Ebrahim Raisi to be criminally investigated for the ongoing crimes against humanity of enforced disappearance, persecution, torture and other inhumane acts, including by systematically concealing the fate of the victims and the whereabouts of their remains.\n\n**Involvement in deadly protest suppression**\n\nOver the decades when Ebrahim Raisi held multiple judicial positions, including as the Head of the Judiciary from 2019 to 2021, Iran’s judiciary was a key driver of human rights violations and crimes under international law, subjecting tens of thousands of people to arbitrary arrests and detentions, enforced disappearance, torture and other ill-treatment, grossly unfair trials, and punishments violating the prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment, such as flogging, amputation and stoning.\n\nUnder Ebrahim Raisi’s watch, the judiciary granted blanket impunity to government officials and security forces suspected of criminal responsibility for unlawfully killing hundreds of men, women and children and subjecting thousands of protesters to mass arbitrary arrests and at least hundreds of them to* *enforced disappearance, and torture or other ill-treatment during and in the aftermath of the nationwide protests of November 2019.\n\nAs Iran’s president and chair of the Supreme Council of National Security during the “Woman Life Freedom” uprising of September-December 2022, Ebrahim Raisi praised and oversaw the violent crackdown by security forces on the nationwide protests, leading to the unlawful killing of hundreds of protesters and bystanders and injuries to thousands of others, as well as the torture and other ill-treatment, including rape and other forms of sexual violence, of arrested protesters.\n\n**Involvement in horrific rise in executions**\n\nFollowing Ebrahim Raisi’s rise to presidency in 2021, he and top officials under him called for increased use of the death penalty in a renewed “war on drugs”. Since then, executions rose sharply, culminating in the execution of at least 853 people in 2023, marking a 172% increase from 2021.\n\nThe horrific rise in executions is largely due to a return to a lethal anti-narcotics policy which, in 2023, saw the authorities carry out at least 481 drug-related executions, marking a 264% increase from 2021.\n\nIn December 2022, the government submitted a bill to parliament based on Ebrahim Raisi’s instructions, which will expand the use of the death penalty for drug-related offences if passed into law. On 8 January 2024, the Parliamentary Legal and Judicial Commission approved the general principles of the bill.\n\nUnder the watch of Ebrahim Raisi as both Head of the Judiciary and President, the Iranian authorities executed at least 2,462 individuals across Iran.\n\n**Involvement in violent assault on women’s rights**\n\nIn 2022, Ebrhaim Raisi orchestrated stricter enforcement of compulsory veiling laws, culminating in the death in custody of Mahsa/Jina Amini in September, days after she was violently arrested by Iran’s “morality” police amid credible reports of torture and other ill- treatment, which led to the “Woman Life Freedom” uprising and subsequent deadly crackdown.\n\nSince the uprising, the Iranian authorities, under the presidency of Ebrahim Raisi and the various executive bodies such as the Ministry of Interior which operate under him, have persecuted women and girls in a violent campaign of oppression to enforce Iran’s degrading and discriminatory compulsory veiling laws.\n\nSince April 2024, Iranian authorities have further intensified their violent enforcement of compulsory veiling with the implementation of a new nationwide campaign called the “Noor (light) Plan”. In recent weeks, there has been a visible increase of security patrols in public spaces enforcing compulsory veiling through surveillance of women’s hair, bodies and attire.\n\nDisturbing videos have emerged on social media showing security forces physically assaulting women and girls in public and arresting and detaining women and girls in a violent manner including by dragging them into police vans while screaming.\n\n“Ebrahim Raisi’s legacy serves as a stark reminder of the crisis of impunity in Iran where those reasonably suspected of crimes under international law not only evade responsibility, but are rewarded with praise and high-ranking positions within the Islamic Republic’s machinery of repression, which without fundamental constitutional, legislative and administrative reforms, is bound to continue,” said Diana Eltahawy.\n\n“States should initiate criminal investigations into Iranian officials reasonably suspected of crimes under international law under the principle of universal jurisdiction to ensure that survivors and victims’ families see perpetrators stand trial and be held to account for their crimes.”\n\n**Background**\n\nAccording to Iranian state media and officials, Ebrahim Raisi died on 19 May 2024 when his helicopter crashed in the Varzeghan region of East Azerbaijan province of Iran. All individuals on board the helicopter, including the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hossein Amirabdollahian, and the helicopter’s pilots and flight crew were killed.",

        "content": "Ultraconservative Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi was killed Sunday, along with his foreign minister, in a helicopter crash in Iran’s remote northwest, injecting fresh uncertainty as the country’s hardline clerical establishment navigates rising regional tensions and domestic discontent.\n\nThe loss of two of Iran’s most influential political figures comes as the country buckles under significant economic and political strain, with tensions with nearby Israel at a dangerous high.\n\nDrone footage of the helicopter wreckage taken by the Red Crescent and carried on Iranian state media showed the crash site on a steep, wooded hillside, with little remaining of the helicopter beyond a blue and white tail.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei – the final arbiter of domestic and foreign affairs in the country – announced five days of public mourning and confirmed that Iran’s First Vice President, Mohammad Mokhber, is now managing the executive branch.\n\nSunday’s crash occurred as Raisi, 63, and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian were returning from a ceremony for an opening of a dam on Iran’s border with Azerbaijan, state media reported.\n\nAmong those onboard were three crew members, the governor of Eastern Azerbaijan province, an imam, Raisi’s head of security chief and a bodyguard, according to IRGC-run media outlet Sepah.\n\nThe crash prompted an hours-long search-and-rescue operation with assistance from the European Union and Turkey among others, but emergency crews were hampered by the thick fog and plummeting temperatures.\n\nCNN confirmed the geolocation of the crash site to the mountainous region in Varzeghan, near the village of Uzi, in Iran’s East Azerbaijan province.\n\nThe death of Raisi comes at a sensitive time domestically for Tehran and seven months into Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza that has sent tensions soaring throughout the Middle East — and brought a decades-long shadow war between Israel and Iran out into the open.\n\nLast month, Iran launched an unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel — its first ever direct attack on the country — in response to a deadly apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus.\n\nUnder Raisi, Iran’s hardline leadership has faced significant challenges in recent years, convulsed by youth-led demonstrations against clerical rule and grim economic conditions. Iranian authorities have launched a widening crackdown on dissent since nationwide protests broke out over the 2022 death of a young woman in the custody of the country’s notorious morality police.\n\nFollowing the official announcement of Raisi’s death Monday, Iran’s government convened an “urgent meeting” as the clerical establishment, headed by Khamenei, prepare to appoint a new president they can throw their support behind.\n\nThe Iranian constitution also mandates that the three heads of the branches of government, including the Vice President, speaker of the parliament, and head of the judiciary, must arrange for an election and elect a new leader within 50 days of assuming the role of acting President.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president’s cabinet praised Raisi as a “hard-working and tireless” president who served the people of Iran to help advance and progress the country. “[He] stood by his promise and sacrificed his life for the nation,” the statement said.\n\nThe cabinet, seeking to affirm calm in the country, also insisted there “will not be the slightest disturbance” in the administration of Iran in the wake of the deadly crash.\n\nOn Monday, Iranian state broadcasters took to airing Islamic prayers in between news broadcasts, while a photo shared by IRNA showed that the chair that Raisi usually sits in was vacant and draped with a black sash in memory of the president.\n\n## A president groomed for real power\n\nRaisi came to Iran’s presidency from the judiciary, where he drew attention from both the Iranian clerical elite and Western critics for his hardline approach to dissent and human rights in the country.\n\nIn 2019 — the same year that Raisi became Iran’s chief justice — he was sanctioned by the US, citing his participation in the 1988 “death commission” as a prosecutor and a United Nations report on the judicial execution of at least nine children between 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) has accused him of crimes against humanity for being part of the committee that oversaw the execution of up to 5,000 political prisoners in 1988. Raisi has never commented on these allegations.\n\nFor Iran’s ruling establishment, though, Raisi seemed to be made in the image of the 1979 Islamic Revolution’s ideals, a guarantor of its continuation even as many chafed under its ultraconservative rules.\n\nIn 2021, he was elected to the presidency in a contest heavily engineered by the Islamic Republic’s political elite so that he would run virtually unchallenged. Raisi’s inauguration was seen to signal the start of a new harder-line era in Iran.\n\nMany activists accused Iran’s clerical establishment of “selecting” rather than electing the next president in a poll designed to further entrench the power of the country’s hardline clerical rulers, despite the public’s calls for reforms. Overall voter turnout was 48.8% – the lowest since the establishment of the Islamic Republic.\n\nHe took the presidency as negotiations with the United States over how to revive the 2015 nuclear deal stalled, and as the country was in the throes of an economic crisis and under mounting pressure to reform.\n\nAs President, Raisi is widely seen as a figure in which the Iranian clerical establishment has heavily invested – and even as a potential successor to the 85-year-old Khamenei. Many believe he has been groomed to be elevated to the Supreme Leadership.\n\nA year into his presidency, he brutally quashed a youth-led uprising over repressive laws, such as the compulsory hijab, and continued to stamp out dissent in its aftermath. As recently as this month, a dissident rapper was handed a death sentence in releation to the 2022 protests.\n\nA United Nations report found that Iran’s “repression of peaceful protests” and “institutional discrimination against women and girls” has led to human rights violations, some of which amount to “crimes against humanity.”\n\nIn foreign policy, Raisi notably presided over the strongest Iran-backed show of force against Israel in nearly two decades. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October, Tehran-supported armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen have continuously attacked Israel and its allies in the region.\n\nHe also spurned negotiations with the US over Iran’s nuclear program, dealing a devastating blow to stalled talks with the Biden administration that aimed to revive the Obama-era deal of sanctions relief in exchange for curbs to the country’s uranium enrichment program. That deal was upended by Trump in 2018, when the former president unleashed waves of sanctions on Iran despite Tehran ostensibly sticking to its end of the bargain.\n\nShortly after, the country announced its intention to enrich uranium up to 60% purity, pushing the country closer to reaching the 90% enrichment level that is considered weapons-grade. In March 2023, uranium particles enriched to near bomb-grade levels were found at an Iranian nuclear facility, according to the UN’s nuclear watchdog, as the US warned that Tehran’s ability to build a nuclear bomb was accelerating.\n\nAs he turned his back to Washington, Raisi sought to end his country’s economic isolation by looking elsewhere, strengthening Tehran’s relationship with China, and repairing diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Gulf Arab powerhouses which were long considered Tehran’s arch-foes.\n\nIran’s economy has begun to rebound over the past two years, according to the World Bank. But the nation remains shackled by sanctions, its social movements brutally repressed, and its political structure now shaken by Raisi’s sudden death.\n\n*This is a developing story and will be updated.*\n\n*Correction: This article has been updated to remove a reference to former President Hassan Rouhani running in the 2021 election.*",

        "content": "Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and several others were killed in a helicopter crash in the country's East Azerbaijan province on Sunday, officials announced.\n\nThe latest: The helicopter crash was caused by an unspecified \"technical failure\" with the vehicle, Iranian state media reported Monday.\n\nZoom in: Iranian Vice President Mohsen Mansouri confirmed on Monday the deaths of Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and seven others who were on board the helicopter when it crashed after state media first reported the news, per Reuters.\n\nIranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS) chief Pirhossein Kolivand said earlier Monday that search and rescue crews had reached the crash site in the mountainous northwest region and found no sign of survivors, according to Iran's semi-official Mehr News Agency.\n\nA State Department spokesperson said in an email Sunday night that U.S. officials were closely following reports of a possible hard landing of the helicopter in Iran, but declined to comment further.\n\nThe big picture: Raisi, 63, and the others were returning from a ceremony to open the dam of Qiz Qalasi, located on the border of Iran and Azerbaijan, with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev. Three other helicopters were traveling with Raisi's aircraft, but lost contact before the crash.\n\nExtremely cold weather and dense fog had hampered rescue efforts and delayed finding the precise location after helicopters of the 6th combat base of Tabriz Air Force arrived in the Varzeqan area.\n\nThe commander of Iran's 6th Air Force Base said in a statement Sunday that the helicopters, along with a rescue team, were sent to the site of the crash early that day. \"Unfortunately, the operation failed due to unfavorable weather conditions,\" the commander said.\n\nState of play: Search and rescue teams went to the crash site after the helicopter's \"precise geographical coordinates\" were determined via aerial monitoring of the region, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.\n\nA Turkish drone identified a heat source that was suspected to be the helicopter's wreckage and details of the coordinates were shared with Iranian officials, Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency said in a post to X.\n\nTurkey's defense ministry announced that it had deployed a drone and a helicopter with night vision to assist in the search.\n\nA signal from the helicopter and a passenger's cell phone had earlier been received after several hours of searching for the crash site.\n\nZoom out: After winning an election widely seen as orchestrated to ensure his victory in 2021, Raisi's presidency was rocked by two major crises: the 2022 nationwide uprising that Iran's government brutally crushed and overt fighting between Iran and Israel earlier this year.\n\nBefore becoming president, Raisi was sanctioned by the U.S. Department of Treasury for allegedly committing human rights abuses while serving as a government prosecutor.\n\nThe Treasury alleged he participated in government commissions that ordered the extrajudicial executions of thousands of political prisoners in 1988.\n\nWhat they're saying: After news of the crash emerged, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei called on Iranians to pray \"for the health\" of Raisi and other passengers in an address on state television, and said there is no reason to be \"anxious or worried.\"\n\nMansouri told the country's semi-official news agency FARS on Sunday that contact was made with two passengers onboard the helicopter who indicated the crash was \"not severe.\"\n\nRaisi's official Instagram account posted a story urging for prayers for the Iranian president and other passengers shortly after the crash was confirmed.\n\nBetween the lines: While Raisi was Iran's elected leader, he answered to Khamenei, Iran's head of state.\n\nKhamenei announced Monday that Vice President Mohammad Mokhber was appointed as acting president, according to Iran's line of succession.\n\nA new president must be elected within 50 days.\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated with new details throughout.",

        "content": "DUBAI, May 20 (Reuters) - Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, a hardliner seen as a potential successor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was killed when his helicopter crashed in poor weather in mountains near the Azerbaijan border, officials and state media said on Monday.\n\nThe charred wreckage of the helicopter which crashed on Sunday carrying Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and six other passengers and crew was found early on Monday after an overnight search in blizzard conditions.\n\nSign up here.\n\nSupreme Leader Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran's nuclear programme, said First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber, would take over as interim president, the official IRNA news agency reported.\n\n\"I announce five days of public mourning and offer my condolences to the dear people of Iran,\" Khamenei said in a statement. Mokhber, like Raisi, is seen as close to Khamenei.\n\nThe crash comes at a time of growing dissent within Iran over an array of political, social and economic crises. Iran's clerical rulers face international pressure over Tehran's disputed nuclear programme and its deepening military ties with Russia during the war in Ukraine.\n\nSince Iran's ally Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, provoking Israel's assault on Gaza, conflagrations involving Iran-aligned groups have erupted throughout the Middle East.\n\nA long \"shadow war\" between Iran and Israel broke into the open last month with tit-for-tat exchanges of drone and missile fire.\n\nAn Israeli official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters it was not involved in the crash. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he had no insight into the cause of the crash, adding the United States had no part to play in it.\n\nUnder the Islamic Republic's constitution, a new presidential election must be held within 50 days.\n\nAny candidate must first be vetted by the Guardian Council, a hardline watchdog that has often disqualified even prominent conservative and moderate officials, meaning the overall thrust of Iranian policy would be unlikely to change.\n\n\"As Iran selects a new president, we reaffirm our support for the Iranian people and their struggle for human rights and fundamental freedoms,\" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said as the U.S. expressed its \"official condolences\".\n\n## 'ONE HARDLINER DIES, ANOTHER TAKES OVER'\n\nGovernment loyalists packed into mosques and squares to pray for Raisi, but most shops remained open and the authorities made little effort to interrupt ordinary life.\n\n\"He was a hard working president. His legacy will endure as long as we are alive,\" said Mohammad Hossein Zarrabi, 28, a member of the volunteer Basij religious militia in the holy Shi'ite city of Qom.\n\nBut other Iranians showed little sorrow.\n\n\"Who cares. One hardliner dies, another takes over and our misery continues,\" said Reza, 47, a shopkeeper in the central desert city of Yazd who did not give his full name, fearing reprisals. \"We're too busy with economic and social issues to worry about such news.\"\n\nState media reported that images from the site showed the U.S.-made Bell 212 helicopter slammed into a mountain peak, although there was no official word on the cause of the crash. The dead also included the governor of East Azerbaijan Province and a senior imam from Tabriz city.\n\nIran was a major buyer of Bell helicopters under the U.S.-backed Shah before the 1979 Islamic revolution, though the exact origin of the aircraft that crashed was not clear. Decades of sanctions have made it hard for Iran to obtain parts or upgrade its aircraft.\n\nThe helicopter went down in Varzeqan region north of Tabriz, as Raisi returned from an official visit to the border with Azerbaijan, in Iran's northwest, to inaugurate the Qiz-Qalasi Dam, a joint project.\n\n## BLOODY CRACKDOWN\n\nSince taking office, Raisi, 63, had ordered a tightening of morality laws, oversaw a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests and pushed hard in nuclear talks with world powers.\n\nIn Iran's dual political system, split between the clerical establishment and the government, it is Raisi's 85-year-old mentor Khamenei, supreme leader since 1989, who holds decision-making power on all major policies.\n\nRaisi's victory in a closely managed election in 2021 brought all branches of power under the control of hardliners, after eight years when the presidency had been held by pragmatist Hassan Rouhani and a nuclear deal negotiated with powers including Washington.\n\nHowever, Raisi's standing may have been dented by the widespread protests against clerical rule following the death of 22-year-old Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in morality police custody, and a failure to turn around Iran's economy, hamstrung by Western sanctions.\n\nThough far from being a foregone conclusion in Iran's opaque politics, Raisi, a middle-ranking Shi'ite cleric, had been widely seen as a leading candidate to succeed Khamenei.\n\n\"There's no other candidate right now (with) that kind of a platform and that's why the presidential elections in Iran, however they unfold, will be the first decider about what comes next,\" said Vali Nasr, professor of Middle East Studies and International Affairs at John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani was appointed as acting foreign minister, IRNA said.\n\nSaudi Arabia's foreign minister called Kani to express condolences and reiterated Saudi's support for Iran.\n\nFuneral ceremonies for Raisi will be held from Tuesday to Thursday in the cities of Tabriz, Qom, Tehran and Birjand until his final burial at the Imam Reza Shrine in Masshad, according to Iranian media.\n\nMessages of condolences flooded in from Iran's other regional neighbours and allies, including the leaders of Syria, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, Iraq and Pakistan.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin called Raisi \"a true friend of Russia\". The Kremlin said he had spoken to Mokhber by phone and both stressed \"mutual intention to further strengthen Russian-Iranian interaction\".\n\nIran-backed militant group Hamas, fighting Israeli forces in Gaza with Tehran's support, issued a statement expressing sympathy to the Iranian people for \"this immense loss\".\n\nReporting by Parisa Hafezi in Dubai and Yomma Ehab and Adam Makary in Cairo; Writing by Stephen Coates, Alex Richardson and Michael Martina; Editing by Lincoln Feast, Sharon Singleton, Alison Williams and Cynthia Osterman\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

        "content": "OAK GLEN, Calif. -- Mudslides and debris flows knocked down trees, plowed into homes and trapped drivers for 10 hours after several Southern California communities were hit by heavy rain, authorities said.\n\nNo one was hurt and authorities were able to get them out, and no one is reported missing, Christopher Prater, a public information officer for San Bernardino County Fire, said Friday.\n\nThe mudslides late Thursday affected the tiny mountain communities of Forest Falls, Oak Glen and Potato Canyon in San Bernardino County, just east of Los Angeles, the county's fire protection district said in a statement.\n\nAuthorities rescued 10 people traveling in at least six vehicles who were stranded on state Route 38 in the area of Jenks Lake, near the San Bernardino National Forest, the fire district said. The route is narrow and winding through towering trees and curves back and forth up the mountainside, linking cities east of Los Angeles with the resort town of Big Bear Lake.\n\nKael Steel told KNBC-TV he was driving down the mountain from Big Bear to head to an amusement park when the rain started pounding.\n\n\"Suddenly we started seeing rocks and stuff coming down the side of the mountain,\" he said.\n\nSteel said cars were turning around telling him the road was blocked. So he headed back up the mountain, but was blocked again. He turned around once more and said the road he had crossed 30 seconds earlier had been wiped away.\n\n\"There's no road there anymore,\" he said.\n\nThe route was still closed as of Friday morning, the California Highway Patrol said.\n\nDamage teams planned to assess the hillside areas impacted by the slides. Officials could not immediately say how many homes were affected or the extent of the damage.\n\n\"The community obviously has been impacted fairly significantly,\" Prater said. \"How bad, we don't know yet.\"\n\nForest Falls, a tiny town just off Route 38, was walloped by mudslides three years ago.",

        "content": "More than 100 people are feared dead in a remote village in the Pacific nation of Papua New Guinea after a landslide flattened homes and buried people alive while they were sleeping, officials said Friday.\n\nThe disaster hit the village of Kaokalam in Enga Province, about 600 kilometers (372 miles) northwest of the capital, Port Moresby, at about 3 a.m. local time (1 p.m. ET, Thursday).\n\nThe remoteness of the affected village, home to nearly 4,000 people, is hindering rescue efforts, according to the Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the country.\n\n“The debris is as big as approximately three to four football fields, and is blocking the lifeline of the province’s main highway, which is making the relief efforts all the more difficult,” Serhan Aktoprak told CNN.\n\n“It’s already dark. It’s already night time in Papua New Guinea. There’s no power to continue the relief efforts. Only with sunrise will the [IOM] teams be returning,” Aktoprak said.\n\nHe added that three bodies had so far been recovered, but the death toll is likely to increase because of the size of the landslide.\n\nThe number of people killed or missing is “very fluid,” but more than 100 are believed to be dead, Janet Philemon, Caretaker and National Treasurer of the Papua New Guinea Red Crescent Society (PNGRCS), told CNN.\n\nThe local community has been scrambling to reach survivors “with whatever tools they have at their disposal,” Philemon said.\n\n“The community themselves are responding, trying to bring out and uncover those that have been buried under the landslide,” she added.\n\nShe said that an earthquake had hit the area a few days prior, which she believed could have contributed to the cause of the landslide.\n\nFootage of the aftermath carried by AFP showed a wide scar of mud and rocks on a steep mountainside slope and locals clambering to look for survivors.\n\nPrime Minister James Marape said in an earlier statement, reported by the ABC and Reuters,** **that his government had sent officials from the country’s disaster agency, defence force, and Department of Works and Highways to meet Enga’s provincial and district authorities, and carry out the rescue and relief efforts, as well as the reconstruction of infrastructure.\n\n“I extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the landslide disaster,” he said,\n\nIn comments reported by the ABC, officials said houses were flattened when the side of a nearby mountain gave way.\n\nCNN has reached out to local authorities, including Ipatas, as well as the national police and the country’s disaster management agency.\n\nA Pacific nation home to around 10 million people, Papua New Guinea is rich in resources, but its economy has long trailed those of its neighbors, and it has one of the highest crime rates in the world.\n\nViolence remains widespread. Chaos erupted in the capital earlier this year after police walked off the job in protest over a drop in their pay, which government officials later blamed on a computer glitch in the payroll system. Shops were looted and buildings set on fire during the disturbance.\n\nHundreds of tribes are spread across the country’s remote and often inaccessible terrain. But its vast and diverse mountainous landscape, as well as a lack of roads, has made it difficult and costly to upgrade basic services like water, electricity and sanitation.",

        "content": "As storms roll in across the state, the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) is reminding people about the dangers of mudslides and debris flows, especially in burn scar areas.\n\nThe National Weather Service is forecasting significant rain across Northern California this week. Communities in flash-flood prone areas must prepare for a higher likelihood of mudslides and debris flows.\n\n**Prepare for Mudslides and Debris Flows**** **\n\n- Pay attention to local emergency response messaging and heed evacuation notifications immediately.\n- Sign up for\n__local emergency alerts__. - Monitor incoming storms, especially if you live in burned areas or downstream/downslope of a burned area.\n- Have an evacuation plan in place for you and your pets.\n\n**During Mudslides and Debris Flows**** **\n\n- Remember – local authorities may indicate it is safer for you and your family to shelter in place if flash flooding is not impacting your neighborhood.\n- Do not walk through moving water – just six inches of water can sweep an adult off his/her feet.\n- Do not attempt to drive through a flood, debris flow or into flooded areas. It takes only a foot of water to float or sweep away most vehicles. Turn around, don’t drown.\n- If you live on a hill, do not sleep in bedrooms that are on the ground floor which face the hazardous slopes.\n\n**Burn Scars**\n\nIn the days, weeks, months and even years after a wildfire, areas that are often left charred by flames and devoid of vegetation can render the soil non-permeable to rainwater. Where intense fires occur, soils can develop a layer that repels water, like rain on pavement, due to the charred remnants of organic material. Rainfall that would normally be absorbed by the soil will instead quickly run off.\n\nSignificantly less rain is required to produce a flash flood, and the potential for mudslides and debris flows increases with the loss of plants and vegetation that holds the soil in place. Because of this, locations that are downhill and downstream from burned areas are highly vulnerable to rain that can cause mudslides and debris flows, especially in and around steep terrain.\n\n**Debris Flow**\n\nCalifornians who live on or below hillsides, especially in areas impacted by recent wildfires, should be aware that precipitation increases the probability of potentially dangerous debris flows.\n\nA debris flow is a fast-moving mass of material — slurries of water, rock, soil, vegetation, boulders and trees – that moves downhill by sliding, flowing and/or falling.\n\nDebris flows range from a few square yards to hundreds of acres in size, and from a few inches to many dozen feet deep. Even smaller ones can be dangerous. Imagine trying to walk through a 3-inch-deep mass of wet concrete moving at 30 mph.\n\n**Mudslide vs. Debris Flow**\n\n**Mudslides**: a type of landslide that results from the failure of a slope and often occurs due to the accumulation of water from**prolonged rainfall**and/or saturated subsurface conditions.**Debris Flows**: described as a “sediment-dominated slurry,” debris flows are mostly made up of soil, resulting from**short-duration**, high-intensity rainfall events.- A mudslide is a localized slope failure, while a debris flow is a runoff event, such as a flash flood, that includes sediment from a broad area.\n- Debris flows and mudslides can occur many years after wildfires. Both happen fast, so heed evacuation warnings immediately.",

        "content": "Papua New Guinea’s Prime Minister has blamed “extraordinary rainfall” and changes to weather patterns for disasters in the Pacific Island nation this year.\n\nParts of a mountain in Enga, a province in the northern part of Papua New Guinea, collapsed late last week.\n\nPrime Minister James Marape said the estimated death toll tops 2,000. Up to 70,000 more in the area have been affected by the disaster.\n\nPapua New Guinea is located just north of Australia in the southwestern Pacific.\n\nEstimates of the death toll from the landslide have varied over recent days, with some local officials estimating it to be much lower than the number given by Marape.\n\nThe prime minister told The Guardian that natural disasters have cost the country nearly $130 million this year, even before the landslide at Enga.\n\nPapua New Guinea regularly experiences natural disasters, but the latest landslide is one of the most devastating it has seen in recent years.\n\nThe country has ramped up rescue efforts, while authorities raised concerns about the outbreak of diseases amid warnings of further landslides. Thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate.\n\nA total of 150 structures were estimated to have been buried by the landslide.",

        "content": "## Studio City residents brace for debris flow 1 year after damaging mudslide\n\nThere are concerns for debris coming off the hillsides in some areas in the San Fernando Valley as heavy rain approaches Southern California.\n\nStudio City could see three to five inches of rain this weekend. About a year ago, a lot of large boulders damaged homes in a huge mudslide in the area.\n\n\"We will be concerned about the back of the hill, which is on that house next door, and then partially on our house,\" said Studio City resident Beverley Hogan.\n\nThe rain totals expected this weekend raise the risk of rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in the steep canyon and hillside areas.\n\n\"It is a dramatic river when it does rain for days on end,\" said Studio City resident Jeanne Johnson. \"And so, there is actually a bit of a natural aqueduct for a lot of rain that comes down this way.\"\n\nLast year, there was a huge slide that sent large rocks and mud through the area. Firefighters had to help 16 residents evacuate from nine houses.\n\nSome of those homes are repaired, and people are rebuilding.\n\nThere are precautions in place for the incoming storm. A large plastic tarp covers part of the hillside, but below, people are still worried.\n\n\"Plastic and sandbags is all we got to protect us, and if it's a significant storm, we don't know what's going to happen,\" resident Rick Hogan said.\n\nHogan's home was yellow-tagged in last year's mudslide. He has made some repairs, but is worried it could happen again.\n\n\"We just have to hope that the best will come our way and that protection up there will be exactly that, protection. It could be against us, it could be for us. If the water comes rushing down that hill, there is nothing to stop it,\" Hogan said.\n\nOn the mountain slopes, rainwater can rapidly accumulate, picking up loose soil, rocks, brush and debris, sending it downhill in a fast-moving flow of mud and water. Even moderate rainfall rates can kick off a debris flow in a weakened hillside.\n\n\"This slope will come down a little bit, you know, not too much. They clean it up pretty quick. And then we always get a bunch of mud flow from here, but they clean it up,\" said actor Clancy Brown, a Studio City resident.",

        "content": "Supported by\n\n# Papua New Guinea Landslide Has Buried 2,000 People, Officials Say\n\nJust getting to survivors has proved to be an enormous challenge, with a blocked highway and unstable ground “posing ongoing danger” to rescue workers.\n\nMore than 2,000 people were buried alive in the landslide that smothered a Papua New Guinea village and work camp on Friday in the country’s remote northern highlands, the authorities told the United Nations on Monday.\n\nGovernment officials visited the disaster site on Sunday. And even as the official death toll jumped from a few dozen to 670, they warned that far more victims than expected appeared to still be caught under the rubble.\n\n“The landslide buried more than 2,000 people alive and caused major destruction to buildings, food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country,” Lusete Laso Mana, an official in the national disaster center, said in a letter to the United Nations.\n\nThe letter stressed that rescue efforts continued to be a challenge. The main highway to the area is blocked, the letter said, and the ground remains unstable as water flows beneath the rocks, shifting land and “posing ongoing danger to both the rescue teams and survivors alike.”\n\nThe region, in Enga Province, is densely populated and located near the Porgera gold mine operated by Barrick Gold, a company based in Canada, in collaboration with Zijin Mining, a Chinese group. It is an area of remote and difficult jungle terrain, in a country of around 12 million people that sits just north of Australia. Tropical and divided along tribal, ethnic and linguistic lines, Papua New Guinea is rich in natural resources but largely underdeveloped, making it especially vulnerable to natural disasters, which strike frequently.\n\n### The landslide took place in a populated area\n\nU.N. officials have been closely monitoring the situation. And with the latest estimate in hand, they emphasized that the need for assistance would be long-term and complicated.\n\n“This situation necessitates immediate action and international support to mitigate further losses and provide essential aid to those affected,” said Anne Mandal, a spokesperson for the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration.\n\nOver the weekend, the agency estimated that, on top of the toll of dead and missing, more than 250 houses had been abandoned as residents feared additional slippage, with roughly 1,250 people displaced. The numbers, including those reported Monday, could not be independently verified.\n\nJust getting to survivors has proved to be an enormous challenge. An aid convoy reached the area on Saturday afternoon to deliver tarps and water, but no food. On Sunday, the local government secured food and water for around 600 people, according to the U.N., but heavy equipment still had not made it through, leaving people to search for bodies on dangerous, unstable debris using small shovels and pitchforks.\n\nTribal feuds have also added to the post-disaster safety risks.\n\nRuth Kissam, a community organizer in Enga Province, said giant boulders fell from the land of one tribe onto a residential town occupied by another tribe.\n\n“There will be tension,” she said. “There is already tension.”\n\nEven before the disaster, the region had been experiencing tribal clashes that led people to flee surrounding villages, with many ending up concentrated in the community buried in the landslide. In September of last year, much of Enga was in a government lockdown and under a curfew, with no flights in or out.\n\nNow, as the search for the dead and living continues, anger and violence have been intensifying.\n\nOn Saturday morning, a quarrel flared between two clans, leaving people dead and dozens of houses burned down, said Serhan Aktoprak, the chief of mission at the International Organization for Migration’s office in Papua New Guinea. He added that the threat of violence makes it harder to deliver aid.\n\nPapua New Guinea officials also stressed a need for calm.\n\n“Following the inspection conducted by the team, it was determined that the damages are extensive and require immediate and collaborative actions from all players,” said the letter from government officials who visited the site.\n\nThe landslide struck the village about 3 a.m. Friday, when many residents were asleep. Some of the boulders that buried houses and cut off a major highway were larger than shipping containers. Even in a region with frequent heavy storms and earthquakes, the landslide has drawn intense expressions of grief from within the country and beyond — including the White House.\n\n“Jill and I are heartbroken by the loss of life and devastation caused by the landslide in Papua New Guinea,” President Biden said in a statement after the disaster. “Our prayers are with all the families impacted by this tragedy and all the first responders who are putting themselves in harm’s way to help their fellow citizens.”\n\nChristopher Cottrell contributed reporting.\n\n**A correction was made on**\n\nAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the chief of mission at the International Organization for Migration’s office in Papua New Guinea. He is Serhan Aktoprak, not Seran.\n\nWhen we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.

        "content": "# Satellite imagery shows landslide that is believed to have buried thousands in Papua New Guinea\n\n## According to a 2021 government estimate, the country had a population of nearly 12 million. Papua New Guinea shares a border with Indonesia and is located north of Australia, both of which have pledged assistance to the disaster.\n\n**PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea – **Satellite imagery is revealing the magnitude of a major landslide believed to have buried thousands of people in a remote region of Papua New Guinea, prompting the country to request international assistance.\n\nMaxar, a space technology company based in Colorado, released images Monday of the Enga region, which showed structures buried in mud and debris.\n\nThe affected villages lie over 200 miles northwest of the capital, Port Moresby. However, travel to the mountainous region has been hindered by roadways deemed impassable.\n\nPhotos showed survivors using sticks and shovels to dig through debris that is estimated to be over 20 feet in some areas.\n\nInitial estimates from the village of Kaokalam put the death toll at around 100, but that figure is believed to have skyrocketed to around 700 and may even go higher, officials warn.\n\n\"The United Nations is monitoring the situation closely, in collaboration with national and provincial government authorities, including other partners to determine the extent of damage, casualties and possible assistance that may be necessary for those affected,\" the United Nations said in a statement.\n\n**NEARLY 700 VILLAGERS FEARED DEAD AFTER MASSIVE LANDSLIDE BURIES COMMUNITIES IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA**\n\nAgency workers say the combination of additional ground movements and an unrelated political conflict are causing slowdowns in relief efforts.\n\nThe office of Prime Minister James Marape has not publicly released figures regarding the number of people believed to still be trapped under debris and rubble. However, officials have stated that the hopes of finding survivors are diminishing.\n\nIt’s unknown what triggered the landslide, but a series of earthquakes and flooding have impacted the Oceanian country over the last few months.\n\nIn March, a 6.9-magnitude quake led to the destruction of over 1,000 homes and in April, flooding and landslides caused devastation throughout villages on the island of New Guinea.\n\nThe country’s vulnerabilities are exacerbated by its mountainous terrain, which can fail during episodes of earthquakes, torrential rainfall or extreme weather events.\n\nAccording to government estimates, over 500,000 residents live in the Enga Province, which was already dealing with poor telecommunication and infrastructure before the latest disaster.\n\n\"One of the major challenges facing the PNGDF (Papua New Guinea Defence Force) Engineering Team is that the tons of earth and rubble and the surrounding landscape are still unstable, so it is quite dangerous to bring in heavy earth moving equipment. Therefore, the government has requested the support of New Zealand Defense Force Geotechnical Team to assess the stability of the land,\" the minister of defense said in a statement.",

The best thing to do is get out of the way.”\n\nForecasters expect the heaviest rain Friday into Saturday night; predictions are for wet days through next week. Storms may stretch from Santa Barbara County south to Los Angeles County, and could spread inland to parts of Orange County and the Inland Empire.\n\nBurn scars — slicked by fire and stripped of plants — are especially vulnerable. A storm after the Thomas Fire in 2018 spurred debris flows in Montecito that killed 23 people. And in February, a debris flow in the Palisades Fire burn zone swept a Los Angeles Fire Department member and his SUV into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Public Works warns that there’s a risk of moderate debris and mudflows capable of blocking roadways and endangering some structures in the burn scars of almost a dozen fires — including January’s Eaton, Hurst and Palisades fires.\n\nThe county has issued evacuation warnings, as well as some targeted evacuation orders for specific properties “at higher risk for mud and debris flows impacts.”\n\nThe public works department says that most burned properties have been cleared of fire debris, and the rest have been shored up with gravel bags and other materials to keep debris in place.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom also announced today that more than 400 personnel and resources including fire engines, helicopters and search and rescue teams have been pre-deployed to Southern California counties.\n\n“It’s a pretty serious situation,” said National Weather Service meteorologist David Gomberg.\n\nBy Friday morning, the storm had already unleashed up to 5 inches of rain in parts of Santa Barbara County, Gomberg said, and Southern California is bracing for more.\n\nThere’s also the possibility of thunderstorms, small tornadoes, and a worrying amount of rain hitting the Eaton and Palisades burn scars. Even just a half-an-inch to 0.6 inches of rain could trigger a debris flow in these areas, said Gomberg, who added that his office is forecasting between half an inch to one inch per hour in these areas.\n\n“And the more you exceed the threshold, the probability of a more damaging debris flow increases,” he said.\n\nWe spoke with the U.S. Geological Survey’s Kean, an expert on debris flows after wildfires, about what to expect. This conversation has been edited and condensed.\n\n### As this storm really takes hold in LA and Southern California, I'm hearing a lot of concern about it hitting areas that burned this past year, including in the Eaton and Palisades fires. Why is this such a big concern? What could happen?\n\nLast January those fires removed much of the vegetation on really steep slopes, and that made those slopes really vulnerable to erosion during intense rainfall. That protective blanket of vegetation is gone, and heavy rain can rapidly make a flash flood. And that flood, in some cases, can pick up material and turn into what we call a debris flow — which is like a flood on steroids.\n\nDamage along Tanoble Drive near Mendocino Street is visible after heavy rainfall triggered multiple mudslides in the Eaton Fire burn scar area in Altadena on Feb. 14, 2025. Photo by Joel Angel Juarez for CalMatters These burn areas are still vulnerable, even though it's now many months after the fire and there have been flows already. There's still plenty of material that could be mobilized. So the threat’s still there. And so we know they're bad actors, and we’re concerned they could be bad actors again.\n\n### I’m hearing a lot of different terms: mudslide, debris flows, landslide. What are the differences, and which ones are the burn scars at risk for?\n\nLandslide is an umbrella term that captures all kinds of mass movements, from rock falls to debris flows — these floods on steroids — to big, slow movers. The type of flow that we're most concerned about in a recent burn area is a debris flow. It's also called a mudslide. But geologists don't like to use the word mudslide as much because it sounds like there's some mud on your driveway — not a big issue, not something that could kill you. And these things, if you're in the wrong spot at the wrong time, they can cause serious damage.\n\n### You called it a flood on steroids. What happens in a debris flow?\n\nFlash floods are bad, and they can cause lots of problems, too. They can get even worse if they pick up enough sediment to turn into the consistency of wet concrete. But it's worse than just concrete, because it can contain boulders the size of cars. And, very close to the mountain front, it can move very quickly — faster than you can run. And when it gets all bulked up with debris, the rocks, the gravel, the mud, trees, the flow can be a lot bigger. It just turns into a different animal.\n\nNow, debris flows pack a bigger punch than floods, but thankfully, they don't have as long of reach. So usually, the debris flows are confined really close to the mountain fronts. That's where they put those debris basins to catch them. But if there isn't one protection like that, then they can travel downslope and impact neighborhoods, and then flooding can extend even further down.\n\n### Is there something about Southern California that makes it higher risk?\n\nSouthern California's kind of the world capital for these kinds of events. It's got this combination of very steep topography, like the San Gabriel Mountains that just shoot right up, Santa Monica mountains, Santa Ynez — very steep topography. It burns fairly frequently. And then there are a lot of people living very close to the mountain front, so that's what puts the risk up.\n\nThe thing about a burn area is it takes much less rainfall to cause a problem than it would in unburned conditions. So we've now made the slopes really vulnerable. They're extra steep. There's a lot of people there. That's why the risk is so high.\n\nWe've seen debris flows in Northern California burn areas as well. It's not just a Southern California problem, and it's not just a California problem.\n\n### Is there anything that could have been done to reduce this risk? Anything that should be done now?\n\nNot long after the fires, in particular the Palisades Fire, (there were) a number of fairly widespread debris flows that disrupted the roads. There were also, in the Eaton fire, floods and debris flows there. Thankfully there's a dense network of LA County debris basins, which are designed to catch the material before it enters neighborhoods, and those largely saved the day.\n\nPlanners have planned ahead and put in these debris basins — these big, giant holes in the ground — designed to catch the material. That's the best defense against these. They're not everywhere, but there is a good network of protection. Other than that, it's really hard to stop these things.\n\n### What should people who live near the recent burn scars know? What should they do now, as the rain starts?\n\nThe best thing you could do is, if you're really close to a drainage in one of these burn areas, is to get out of the way. You're going to get a heads up from the National Weather Service, who's closely monitoring the rainstorms. They know how much rain it's going to take to cause a problem, and they'll get out warnings, and local authorities will reach out to get people out of the way. So there's a lot of eyes on the situation. And so at this point, the best thing to do is listen to the weather service, listen to local authorities.\n\nIf they ask you to get out of the way, take their advice. These things can happen really fast if there is an intense burst of rain, a flash flood, where debris flow can start within minutes.\n\n### So there is no escaping a debris flow once it starts?\n\nIt's pretty difficult. If you have a two-story home and you happen to be there at the wrong time, get up to that second floor for sure. Fight like heck if you get trapped in one. But best to be out of the way.\n\n*This story was originally published by * *CalMatters* ,* a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that explains California policies and politics and makes its government more transparent and accountable*\n\n-\nDown south, a group of bagel makers is quietly generating excitement in the bagel-verse.\n-\nThe spending plan would gut prevention, outreach and supportive services to maintain temporary shelter beds and absorb rate increases previously covered by other funding sources.\n-\nEarlier mergers, like Disney's 2019 acquisition of Fox, cut the number of films studios released theatrically — a troubling trend for theater owners already coping with consolidation and streaming.\n-\nPublic documents reviewed by LAist reveal an ongoing dispute between the city and its contractors.\n-\nThe project runs on an approximately four-mile stretch of the street between North Mission Road near LAC+USC Medical Center and Alhambra/South Pasadena.\n-\nMore than 13 inches of rain fell in the Santa Ynez Mountains over the weekend.

More than a month’s worth of rain fell Saturday in many locations, with more still to come.\n\nNovember marks a transition into the rainier winter season, with December to February marking the wettest months of the year in the Bay Area.\n\nAs the storm drenched the region Friday, a 71-year-old man died after his car was pushed off a flooded bridge in the Sacramento Valley and a father died trying to save his 5-year-old daughter from 20-foot waves at a state park beach along the central coast.\n\nThe flood threat has intensified as an atmospheric river feeds moisture from the ocean into the storm.\n\nParts of the region – including much of the Los Angeles area – are under a Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall on Saturday, according to the Weather Prediction Center.\n\nRainfall amounts up to 1.5 inches have been widespread in the Los Angeles area since early Saturday, with totals surpassing 2 inches farther northeast into Ventura County.\n\nLos Angeles and Long Beach are among several Southern California cities that have recorded more rain on Saturday than is typical for all of November. Oxnard saw 1.56 inches, up from an average of 0.71 inches in November.\n\nLos Angeles has picked up 2.75 inches of rain since the earliest hours of Friday morning, which is more than three Novembers’ worth of rain in under 48 hours.\n\nThis second round of rain has the added danger of falling over already-wet ground, which struggles to absorb additional rain and will start flooding quicker than dry ground.\n\nThere’s also the potential for isolated severe thunderstorms embedded within the heavier rain Saturday. Some of these storms could produce damaging wind gusts, hail and perhaps a short-lived tornado.\n\nMuch of the Los Angeles area is under a flood watch through Saturday evening. The National Weather Service warns the storm could trigger life-threatening debris flows, knock out power and flood roads.\n\n## Burn scar areas on alert\n\nAreas burned by recent wildfires in the region will be particularly vulnerable to mudslides and debris flows.\n\nNot only do wildfires destroy vegetation that would normally soak up some of the rainfall, but their extreme heat can alter the soil, creating a water-repellent layer just below the surface.\n\nEvacuation orders in effect through** **Sunday morning cover parts of the Palisades, Hurst and Sunset burn scars, but those are not the only areas at risk of dangerous debris flows.\n\nParts of the Eaton and Bridge burn scars also have a high threat of “significant” debris flows, the National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned Friday morning.\n\nThe heaviest rain is expected to ease late Saturday, but the region isn’t in the clear. Showers linger into Sunday, and the ground will be saturated. It won’t take much rain to trigger more minor flooding or keep roads slick, especially in spots that usually drain slowly after big storms.\n\nCNN’s Joe Sutton contributed to this report.",

        "content": "- Share via\n\nStorm of the season pounds Southern California as burn areas brace for mudslides, flooding\n\nThe most powerful band of a large atmospheric river storm slammed into Southern California on Saturday, dumping much-needed rain across the region but also bringing mudslide dangers to communities still reeling from January’s firestorms.\n\nThe storm flooded some streets and highways, sent mud and rocks sliding onto some canyon roads and made for treacherous driving conditions.\n\n- Share via\n\n5-year-old girl missing, father dead after large wave sweeps them into ocean near Big Sur\n\nA 5-year-old girl is missing and her father is dead after they were swept into the ocean by a wave at Garrapata State Park along the Big Sur coast Friday afternoon, according to authorities.\n\nThe Monterey County Sheriff’s Office responded to the incident, which occurred just before 1 p.m. Friday when the girl’s father attempted to rescue her from waves measuring 15 to 20 feet, authorities said.\n\n- Share via\n\nSurfers hit the beach for the storm swell. They didn’t anticipate toxic runoff.\n\nAt Topanga Beach in Malibu, surfers took advantage of the weekend storm, which they said brings better surfing conditions and scares off the Saturday crowd.\n\nThey were undeterred by the brown and murky waves — discolored by rushing storm runoff from a nearby estuary.\n\n“Guys show up all at once when the storm is heating up so they can catch the swell,” one surfer, Jesus Guzman said.\n\nAnother, Nick Kernkamp, checked the website Surfline.com to make sure conditions were preferable before driving to the beach.\n\n“The waves were a little bigger than usual for this swell,” he said. “But I come when it rains mainly because there aren’t as many people around.”\n\nBut the Los Angeles County Department of Public Heath says it’s usually a good idea to avoid the ocean during and after a storm, especially near areas like Malibu, which has open wounds from January’s Palisades Fire.\n\n“Due to current rainfall, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health advises beach users to avoid all water contact, especially near discharging storm drains, creeks, and rivers due to potentially higher bacteria levels in these areas,” the department stated Saturday morning.\n\nThough cleanup efforts are well underway after the January Palisades fire, burn scars are known to contaminate water systems for several years following a major wildfire.\n\nGuzman said he didn’t notice any side effects but a passing surfer said he had eye irritation.\n\n—Gavin J. Quinton\n\n- Share via\n\nFelled trees, mud-coated roads: Storm wreaks havoc around Southland\n\nFlooding and mud and debris flows caused headaches across Southern California as a significant atmospheric river soaked the region.\n\nAt least 58 trees have been blown down across Los Angeles, felled by thunderstorm-driven wind damage, officials told the National Weather Service.\n\nUp to 3 feet of water inundated one of the Long Beach Boulevard offramps on the 710 Freeway, officials said. Floodwaters were also blocking some lanes of the northbound 710 at Long Beach Boulevard, according to the California Highway Patrol.\n\nIn East L.A., floodwater covered a lane of traffic on Highway 60 at East 3rd Street, causing several vehicles to spin out, according to reports received by the weather service. Large tree branches fell on the 110 Freeway near Fair Oaks Avenue in South Pasadena.\n\nIn Santa Clarita, rocks and debris covered all lanes at Soledad Canyon and Oak Spring Canyon roads. Nearby, large boulders tumbled onto Highway 14, blocking lanes of traffic. On the Grapevine section of the 5 Freeway, severe flooding covered offramps and the main freeway in at a couple of locations.\n\nAll lanes of Mulholland Highway were covered in rocks and mud at Stunt Road, about four miles south of Calabasas. Elsewhere in the Santa Monica Mountains, between Thousand Oaks and Malibu, a large rockslide blocked the road at Encinal Canyon Road and Zuma Ridge Motorway. All lanes of Malibu Canyon Road were flooded near Pacific Coast Highway.\n\nIn Ventura County, Conejo Creek overflowed and spilled out of its channel, flooding farmland in Camarillo. A mudflow also covered part of the northbound 101 Freeway near La Conchita. Mud and rocks spilled over the 101 just southeast of Carpinteria, and the freeway and its offramps were also flooded in Ventura.\n\n- Share via\n\nFlash-flood warnings end in L.A. County\n\nThe National Weather Service has canceled the flash-flood warning for much of Southern California, including Los Angeles County.\n\n“The heavy rain has ended,” the weather service said shortly before 2 p.m. “Lingering high water, mudslides, and rockslides will still be concerns long after rain has ended. Heavy downpours are still possible through this evening.”\n\nA flash-flood warning indicates flooding and debris flow are imminent or occurring.\n\nA flood watch, which warns about the possibility of flooding, remains in effect for much of Southern California until 8 p.m.\n\n- Share via\n\nCaltrans crews toil to keep roadways clear of muck and rocks as storm rages\n\nAs the storm picked up Saturday, workers from the California Department of Transportation scrambled to keep roadways clear of debris.\n\nRockfall and debris flow were reported near Topanga Canyon. Rocks were piling along the margins of Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, where storm runoff hindered drivers and forced lane closures.\n\nAlong the coast, dozens of Caltrans crews were working at hillsides and roadways at hazardous junctions.\n\nSpeed limits were reduced to 25 mph near the many worksites between Temescal Canyon and Malibu Point.\n\nCrews have already installed cable nets and erosion-control devices, officials said. Now, they are responding to emergencies, clearing debris with heavy equipment, draining flooded roads to reduce mudflows and removing any unstable rocks identified on steep slopes.\n\nSide roads in residential areas are harder to control, however, especially in fire-affected areas more prone to erosion.\n\nPaseo Portola Street and many others like it were littered with loose mud, debris and chunks of rock scattered down from the Santa Monica Mountains.\n\n“I’m sure it’s created problems for a lot of people,” said Malibu resident Adam Gorski. “It was a problem in the beginning, and of course it gets worse around here when it rains.”\n\nGorski’s Las Flores Canyon home survived the Palisades fire with minor damage. Dozens in the winding Malibu neighborhood were not as lucky.\n\nBobby Vizcarra, a security patrol officer in Las Flores Canyon, said the rockfall has been mild so far, but warned that the worst may be yet to come.\n\n“If it continues to rain and [the ground becomes] saturated, we’re going to have a lot of the earth moving, especially in the burn areas,” he said. “There’s nothing holding back that earth. Once you get it saturated, it’s going to come down.”\n\nHe added that when landslides happen, “they just come down pretty massively … without warning.”\n\nCars parked along canyon roads remain at risk, Vizcarra said, especially near fire-ravaged hillsides where there is no vegetation holding soil in place.\n\n“One of our officers on Malibu Canyon, his unit was actually wiped out from a mountainside,” he said of a previous storm. “It just kicked out right on top of him and pushed him off. He survived, but it’s just one of those unknown things.”\n\n- Share via\n\nCalifornia man swept to his death after driving over flooded bridge\n\nA 71-year-old man died after his car was swept away by rushing water as he tried to drive over a flooded bridge in Sutter County, authorities said.\n\nThe incident highlights the danger of driving during powerful storms like the atmospheric river pounding California this weekend, and serves as a reminder to avoid flooded roadways, according to the California Highway Patrol.\n\nThe driver, whom authorities have not yet publicly identified, arrived at Fifield Road west of Pleasant Grove Road around 2:30 p.m. Friday to meet a delivery driver. According to the California Highway Patrol, the man stopped at a flooded bridge over Pleasant Grove Creek, where water levels had risen 3 feet, according to __CBS News__.\n\n- Share via\n\nVolunteers show up to restore historic Palisades mural despite pouring rain\n\nIn fire-scarred Pacific Palisades, brown runoff pooled over entire lanes of Pacific Coast Highway, while unrelenting rainfall came down in sheets.\n\nBut the strongest storm of the season didn’t stop volunteers from gathering Saturday morning to begin restoring a beloved community mural first painted by Palisades Charter High School students in the early 1980s.\n\nThe mural survived January’s Palisades fire with minor singe marks. But that combined with decades of sun, salt and air pollution made the restoration urgent, conservationists said.\n\n“Through all of the devastation, there is something really beautiful about the community coming together to protect this mural, no matter the weather,” said Davida Persaud, chief operating officer of MuralColors, a local art conservator.\n\nVolunteers draped in rain ponchos and high-visibility vests used brushes to remove an old layer of protective coating from the mural wall.\n\nOne volunteer, Sara Trepanier, lost her home in the blaze and is still rebuilding. She said efforts like this are commonplace in the neighborhood.\n\n“We all take care of each other here,” she said.\n\nMuralColors, a Los Angeles–based public art conservation firm, is leading the project. Persaud said Saturday’s work focused on washing the mural’s surface — removing dirt, oils, ash and remnants of the old coating — while preserving the original brushstrokes.\n\n“It’s been a long time since everyone first connected around this mural,” Persaud said. “Seeing people come out today really doubles down on that investment in community.”\n\nKat Kozik, one of the mural’s original artists, said the blocks-long art piece depicts the history of the Palisades in four panels, beginning with the story of its Indigenous inhabitants.\n\n“It’s comforting to see what’s still here in the Palisades, because if everything was gone it would be too hard,” Kozik said. “Through everything, this land is still here, and that’s part of the wonder of this place.”\n\n- Share via\n\nHow to drive in the rain\n\nHere are some tips on how to drive safely in rainy weather.\n\nThis week’s major storm raises the risk of flooding and mudslides. Here are some quick tips for driving safely.\n\n- Share via\n\nRainy season off to a roaring start in L.A.\n\nDowntown Los Angeles has received more rain in just the last two days than it normally gets in the entire month of November as a powerful atmospheric river continues to douse the region, officials said.\n\nBy the end of the month, this November may end up being among the 20 wettest since 1877, according to Joe Sirard, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Oxnard.\n\nFew Novembers accrue even 2 inches of rain, according to weather officials. Since 1877, the highest November rainfall in downtown L.A. was 9.68 inches in 1965. The 30th-highest rainfall was just 2.02 inches.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, L.A. County‘s coast and valleys had received 1 to 2.5 inches of rain from the storm, with 1.5 to 3.5 inches falling in the mountains, according to the weather service.\n\nThe rainy season in Los Angeles lasts from November to April, with the bulk of rain expected December through March.\n\nDespite the unusually wet November, Sirard said experts actually expect a drier-than-normal winter. However, he said these types of weather patterns are hard to predict.\n\n“Obviously we’re starting off wet, so we’ll see,” he said.\n\nThe Santa Barbara and Ventura county mountains have received the highest rainfall totals so far, ranging from 4 to 7 inches. The San Marcos Pass had received more than 8 inches of rain as of Saturday morning.\n\nThese totals are expected to climb through the afternoon, at which point the heaviest rainfall should pass and Angelenos can expect more intermittent showers through Sunday.\n\n- Share via\n\nConditions worsening fast on Southern California roads, freeways\n\nCaltrans reports that conditions on local roads and freeways are deteriorating as more rain falls.\n\nThe agency said trees are down on roadways and driving conditions are treacherous.\n\nOn Interstate 5, drivers are encountering fog and gusty winds between Gorman and Santa Clarita.\n\nSouthbound 101 Freeway in Ventura has two lanes closed due to flooding at California Street.\n\n- Share via\n\nFlash flood warnings expand as rain pounds Southern California\n\nA flash flood warning has been expanded to cover a large swath of Los Angeles County, including the Eaton fire burn scar in Altadena, the rest of the San Gabriel Valley, the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys and downtown Los Angeles.\n\nFlash flood warnings were previously issued for the Palisades fire burn scar, Malibu, Topanga Canyon and the rest of the Westside, including Santa Monica; as well as the South Bay, including Torrance and the Palos Verdes Peninsula; and much of Ventura County.\n\nA flash flood warning for a recent burn area means that flooding and debris flow are imminent or occurring. A debris flow happens when so much rain has fallen that it picks up mud and other debris moving down hillsides. Minor debris flows can cover roadways and driveways with muck, while major ones can move objects as large as cars, damage homes and wash away roads.\n\n“Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated moderate to heavy showers overspreading the warning area,” the National Weather Service said before 9 a.m. “Through late morning, expected rainfall rates will increase to 0.5 to 1 inch in 1 hour. Flash flooding is expected to begin shortly.”\n\nMud and debris can begin to flow from hillsides when rain falls at a rate of half an inch per hour.\n\nA flood watch remains in effect for a much larger swath of Southern California, meaning that conditions are favorable for flooding. It doesn’t mean flooding will occur, but that flooding is possible, according to the weather service.\n\n- Share via\n\nSanta Monica urges residents to avoid non-essential travel during flash flood warning\n\nCiting a flash flood warning in the city through at least noon, Santa Monica city officials urged residents avoid non-essential travel and not to drive through flooded roadways.\n\n- Share via\n\nStorm could impact many, but some communities at heightened risk\n\nSaturday’s storm could impact large numbers of people, but some regions will be hit harder than others. Flood watches are in effect for some 20 million people — starting at 1 a.m. Saturday for Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, and at 4 a.m. in all of Orange County and much of San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The flood watches are expected to end throughout the region at 10 p.m. Saturday.\n\nIf the rain delivers as expected, Los Angeles could record its wettest November in 40 years, and register one-fifth of its annual average rainfall by the end of the weekend.\n\nGiven the forecast, officials urged residents to avoid nonessential travel, and warned those who must go out to never attempt to drive through a flooded roadway.\n\nIn L.A. County, the areas most at risk for rapid flows of mud and debris are the Eaton burn scar in Altadena, the Palisades burn scar in Pacific Palisades, and the Bridge burn scar north of Claremont. Officials are also closely watching the Line burn scar north of Highland; and the Airport burn scar, located between Rancho Santa Margarita and Lake Elsinore.\n\n- Share via\n\nFlash flood warning in place for large swaths of region\n\nThe National Weather Service has continued flash flood warnings from large swaths of Southern California.\n\nFor Saturday morning, the warnings include big parts of Ventura County, Santa Barbara County and western Los Angeles County from Malibu all the way to Long Beach.\n\nAcross a wide swath of the Southland, there’s a moderate risk for flash flooding, urban flooding and debris flow, a type of landslide in which rainfall pouring off hillsides can pick up mud and other debris with punishing speed, vaulting muck at speeds of up to 35 mph into homes and sweeping away parked cars.\n\nThere’s a small chance of particularly severe weather, including locally damaging winds and even a tornado.\n\n- Share via\n\nCalifornia’s atmospheric river intensifies, bringing widespread flood risk. Here’s what to expect\n\nThe atmospheric river storm soaking Southern California is expected to peak Saturday, with officials warning of potential flooding and damaging landslides, especially around recently burned areas.\n\nAcross a wide swath of the Southland, there’s a moderate risk for flash flooding, urban flooding and debris flow, a type of landslide in which rainfall pouring off hillsides can pick up mud and other debris with punishing speed, vaulting muck at speeds of up to 35 mph into homes and sweeping away parked cars.\n\n- Share via\n\nEmergency storm shelters opened to support Angelenos\n\nThe Red Cross opened three emergency shelters Friday to support those affected by evacuation orders and flooding amid the stormy weather in Los Angeles County.\n\nThe shelters are located at:\n\n- Stoner Recreation Center, 1835 Stoner Ave., Los Angeles, 90025\n- College of the Canyons, 26455 Rockwell Canyon Road, Valencia, 91355\n- Arcadia Community Park, 405 S. Santa Anita Ave., Arcadia, 91006\n\nThe shelters offer meals, snacks, water, health services and overnight accommodations and will remain open as long as needed.\n\nL.A.

Consider changing your weekend plans and stay home, cuddle up, watch a movie,” Chief Jaime Moore said at an evening news conference. “Spend some family time.”\n\nWhile the worst of the storm isn’t expected to hit until early Saturday morning, there have already been reports of downed trees, he said.\n\nShould residents need to venture outside, Moore warned people to avoid walking or driving through moving water and to stay away from any downed power lines.\n\nFree ready-to-fill sandbags are available for pickup at all neighborhood L.A. Fire Department stations, while sand is available at Fire Station 5, Fire Station 64, Fire Station 91, Fire Station 77, and the Sunland-Tujunga Municipal Building.\n\nSandbags can be used to divert moving water, redirecting storm and mudflows away from property.\n\nLAFD has pre-deployed resources across the city to respond to storm-related hazards. This includes a 22-member strike team with five fire engines patrolling the Pacific Palisades area, which is at high risk of mudslides and debris flows due to January’s fire, Moore said.\n\nUrban search-and-rescue and swift-water rescue teams have been staged in the San Fernando Valley, while seven brush patrol vehicles are prepared to quickly reach narrow streets in high-risk terrain.\n\n- Share via\n\nHigh-risk homes ordered to evacuate in Palisades, other burn scars\n\nAs Los Angeles braces for the ongoing storm to intensify overnight, evacuation orders have been issued to residents living in specified high-risk homes in Pacific Palisades and other recently burned areas.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department has notified 126 residents that they need to prepare to leave immediately as their homes are at the highest danger of storm-related damage, Chief Jim McDonnell said at an evening news conference.\n\n“Due to the increased risk of mud and debris flow, the city has issued an evacuation order for specific properties considered vulnerable to safety risks, with a significant portion of those properties contained within the Pacific Palisades burn zone,” he said.\n\nLAPD officers will patrol the evacuated areas to suppress potential crime while orders are in place. The city has opened an evacuation center at Stoner Recreation Center, at 1835 Stoner Ave.\n\nAll major burn scars in L.A. County are under evacuation warnings from 8 p.m. Friday until 8 a.m. Sunday.\n\nResidents under evacuation warnings should also be prepared to leave should weather conditions worsen and can sign up for emergency alerts at alert.lacounty.gov.\n\n- Share via\n\nOrange County issues evacuation warning in Airport fire burn area\n\nOrange County has issued an evacuation warning for the Airport fire burn scar as a powerful storm slams into the Southland, bringing with it the danger of mudslides and debris flows.\n\nThe Airport fire ignited on Sept. 9, 2024, and went on to burn for 26 days, ultimately scorching more than 23,000 acres and destroying 160 structures.\n\nThe evacuation warning, effective 4 p.m. Friday, applies to residents living within the areas of Trabuco Creek, Bell Canyon and Hot Springs Canyon.\n\nA shelter for residents who choose to evacuate opens at 7 p.m. at the Foothill Ranch Library Program Annex, 27002 Cabriole Way in Foothill Ranch.\n\nOfficials urged residents with large animals to move them before rain arrives.\n\nL.A. County has also issued evacuation warnings in areas that burned in recent years. These are in effect from 8 p.m. Friday through 8 a.m. Saturday. The county has also issued mandatory evacuation orders for burn scar properties deemed to be at highest risk of flooding.\n\nWildfires destroy vegetation and root systems that normally absorb water and anchor soil, leaving slopes loose and exposed. The fire’s heat also creates a water-repellent layer in the soil, which can cause rain to run off quickly, creating mud and debris flows.\n\n- Share via\n\nRains bring mudslide risk: What to know\n\nWith this week’s rain, mudflows are possible in some burn areas such as Pacific Palisades and Malibu.\n\nHere are some tips for dealing with the danger:\n\n- An intense rain (typically about half an inch per hour — like a thunderstorm) on a recently burned slope can trigger a debris flow.\n- Just a few minutes of intense rain can start a debris flow. The National Weather Service will issue a flash flood watch or warning for your area when rainfall is anticipated to be intense. Note that it’s the rain in the mountains that will start the debris flow, even if it’s not raining — or only sprinkling — where you live.\n- Debris flows can hit new areas or return to previous areas; they might be smaller — or larger — the next time. Whatever happened before, the next time could be different.\n- Debris flows move fast! If you wait to see if a debris flow is coming your way, it will be too late to leave safely. You cannot outrun a debris flow.\n- Find the highest point nearby (such as a second story room or the roof) and be ready to get there at a moment’s notice. Listen and watch for rushing water, mud, and unusual sounds. Survivors describe sounds of cracking, breaking, roaring, or a freight train in advance of a debris flow.\n- Debris flows can start in places they’ve never been before. They can leave stream channels and plow through neighborhoods. When a debris flow is small, people can control it with walls, K-rails and sandbags. When a debris flow is big enough, nothing can stop it.\n- Storms that can cause debris flows can also cause more common flooding dangers.\n- Be aware that the soil may be waterlogged and that more rain can trigger debris flows.\n- Debris flows can bury people sleeping in lower-floor bedrooms adjacent to hazardous slopes.\n\n- Share via\n\nHow to prepare for a blackout\n\n**Check your emergency kit. **For a potential outage — and any other kind of disaster that might strike — you want to have an emergency kit in place. Have your supplies ready, including nonperishable food, drinking water, flashlight batteries, a fire extinguisher, cash, a first-aid kit and a hand-crank weather radio (you can find a full list of useful items here).\n\n**Make a plan for your family.** Every plan will look different. If you have young children, make sure you have enough formula, diapers and other supplies to last a few days. If you have pets, double-check your kibble stash.\n\nMake sure everyone who takes a medication has a few days’ worth on hand. If a family member uses a mobility device, figure out how you’ll get them out of your building without using an elevator. If someone uses a medical device that plugs in, make sure it’s fully charged and you have a battery-powered backup option on hand.\n\nWrite down pertinent phone numbers for family members, doctors and insurance companies, in case your smartphone dies and you lose access to your list of contacts. Decide where you’ll go if you need to evacuate.\n\n**Charge devices, fill your tank, check your batteries. **Make sure all your phones, tablets, e-book readers and laptops are fully charged. Consider charging an extra battery pack, if you have one.\n\nFill your gas tank or charge your EV’s battery. Check the batteries in your flashlights and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, and locate extras in case you need them.\n\n**You can find more advice** on preparing for a storm, along with tips for what to do during and after one, in this link.\n\n- Share via\n\nEaton fire victims brace to possibly evacuate as storm rolls in\n\nWith an atmospheric river storm rolling in, many Altadena residents already traumatized by the experience of evacuating during the Eaton fire are now performing the all-too-familiar ritual of packing their belongings and preparing to flee.\n\nLos Angeles County officials have issued evacuation warnings to residents living near burn areas across the region due to the risk of flooding and debris flows.\n\nThe area near East Loma Alta Drive in Altadena still has open wounds from January’s Eaton fire, which destroyed most homes in the area.\n\nOne Altadena native, Austin Solliday, now lives in a small trailer and camping tent where his home once stood. He’s fixed a tarp to the setup and, for now, is planning to stay put.\n\n“I’m hoping I’m set up enough to stay there,” he said. “I have the camper parked and all sealed up.”\n\nHe said he plans to wait until conditions worsen before deciding whether to evacuate.\n\n“For now, I’m just gonna try to ride it out,” he said.\n\nSandbags have been distributed to help minimize the risk of mudslides and flooding, while L.A. County fire officials and sheriff’s deputies were on standby nearby to facilitate the evacuation warning.\n\nFurther uphill on Canon Boulevard, workers used a forklift to hoist about a dozen concrete barriers purchased by a homeowner in preparation for potentially serious flooding.\n\nMeanwhile, Tanya Kirk and her husband were packing their car with bags and their two dogs.\n\n“We’re evacuating just in case it gets bad with the mudslides,” she said.\n\nLike Solliday, the Kirks lost their home, which had been in the family for over 50 years, in January’s firestorm. They are living in a camper on their lot until they are able to rebuild.\n\n“Hopefully it doesn’t get bad,” Kirk said. “Anyway, it’s not our first time evacuating.”\n\n- Share via\n\nTyler, the Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw postponed because of L.A. rain\n\nCamp Flog Gnaw is being postponed because of the rain in Los Angeles.\n\nThe annual music festival presented by Tyler, the Creator — which was supposed to take place this weekend on the grounds surrounding Dodger Stadium — will now happen Nov. 22 and 23 in the same location.\n\n- Share via\n\nStorm slams Southern California as record-breaking rain possible this weekend\n\nSouthern California will be under a severe weather threat Saturday, with the most powerful wave of an incoming atmospheric river storm peaking over the weekend in Los Angeles County and bringing a risk of mudflows, debris flows and, possibly, a tornado.\n\nIf rain falls as forecast, this storm could result in downtown Los Angeles seeing its wettest November since 1985. Heavy rain brings the possibility of damaging flooding and landslides, with fire-scarred hillsides from the Eaton and Palisades fires at risk of fast-moving flows of mud and debris.\n\n- Share via\n\nSo when will the peak of the storm be for L.A. County?\n\nThe worst will be generally on Saturday, from 3 a.m. to 6 p.m., said Ryan Kittell, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s not possible to be more specific than that 15-hour period, given the peculiar nature of this storm. And for any particular location, don’t expect it’ll rain heavily that entire time.\n\nThis storm will spin like a top, potentially making it sit over L.A. County for a longer period of time than a more typical cold front storm that moves with the jet stream, where forecasters can predict a six-to-nine hour window of rain, Kittell said.\n\n“Because this thing is just spinning as it wills, it is a bigger window of potential,” Kittell said.\n\nMost people in Southern California will not experience dangerous flooding, Kittell said, but there could be localized areas where dangerous or damaging flooding will occur on Saturday.\n\n“Certainly, it’s best to be overprepared instead of underprepared,” Kittell said.\n\n- Share via\n\nStorm expected to intensify Saturday, posing risks to Eaton and Palisades burn scars\n\nRain rates have been fairly modest so far in L.A. County on Friday. But the rain is expected to intensify on Saturday, when most of the rain that will be dumped from this storm is expected from 3 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe Eaton and Palisades burn scars could get an additional 5 inches of rain between Friday night through Sunday, said Ryan Kittell, meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Oxnard.\n\nThere’s about a four-in-five probability that the Eaton and Palisades burn scars will see rain fall at a rate of 0.5 inches per hour or higher. In general, that’s an important threshold, as that’s the rate at which landslides can begin. If that happens, forecasters expect at least some shallow, minor flows of mud and other debris that could cover up roads and canyons in muck.\n\nThere’s also a one-in-three chance of a worse-case scenario for the Eaton and Palisades burn scars, in which rain could fall at a rate of 1 inch per hour or more. That could possibly cause more damaging landslides, “which would be certainly dangerous and life threatening,” Kittell said.\n\nHeavy rates of rainfall can unleash torrents of water down hillsides that pick up mud and other debris, capable of turning parked cars into tumbling boulders and moving a wall of mud and rocks to damage or destroy homes.\n\n- Share via\n\nWhat makes this storm different from others\n\nPart of what makes this storm so unpredictable and potentially problematic is that on Saturday, it’s going to spin like a top. That’s in contrast to the typical storm, which is pushed along by the jet stream, from west to east, and is easier to forecast.\n\nIn a worse-case scenario, it’ll just hang around and dump a lot of rain over a specific area, so it might be a little unpredictable to exactly time out. And that’s the reason why it’s potentially so problematic in terms of debris flow. On the flip side, it could also wobble off shore, and produce less rain over land than we might expect.\n\n- Share via\n\nL.A. hates driving in the rain. How to survive your commute during this week’s storm\n\nThis week’s rainstorm could make roads and freeways slick and dangerous. Here are some quick tips for driving and other rain safety tips from the pages of The Times.\n\n**1. Don’t enter flooded streets.** As little as 6 inches of water can cause cars to stall or knock an adult off their feet. Two feet of water can sweep a car off the road, including an SUV or pickup truck. Any amount of water means you won’t be able to see what condition the road is in. Heed all road closure notifications and instructions from emergency responders.\n\n- Share via\n\n5 inches of rain dumped on Santa Barbara while Los Angeles County gets a light drizzle\n\nThe storm was only giving Los Angeles a light sprinkle on Friday morning.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, the rain was falling at a rate of about a tenth of an inch an hour, no where near the type of heavy downpour that would trigger a mud or debris flow in the foothills.\n\nThe storm was stronger to the west in Ventura County, where meteorologist Ryan Kittell said rain was falling at a rate of about a quarter of an inch an hour. Not far away, parts of Santa Barbara had already accumulated more than five inches of rain before noon.\n\nThe burn scars near the Eaton and Palisades fires received a tenth of an inch of rain per hour on Friday, with the most concerning period slated for Friday night through Saturday, according to Kittell. During that time, it’s expected to rain half an inch per hour, which can be enough to trigger a debris flow.\n\nThe heaviest rain is expected to take place Saturday in Ventura County, along with western L.A. County and Santa Barbara County.\n\n- Share via\n\n‘People around here don’t really care.’ Altadena neighborhood weary as storm approaches\n\nAs the rain picked up and pools of water formed along the roadside, homeowner Armen Mehrabi arrived at his Altadena home.\n\nAsked about the storm preparation in the neighborhood, Mehrabi replied “people around here don’t really care.”\n\nHe explained that the attitudes of some of his neighbors has been somewhat apathetic since January’s firestorm.\n\n“There’s a street where only one house survived,” Mehrabi recalled. “I talked to the owner and he said ‘I honestly wish this burned down, man’ because we’re having such a hard time dealing with the cleaners, insurance, and these private companies.”\n\nStill, there are signs of storm preparation around the neighborhood, most evident in vacant lots covered in loose gravel. Sandbags and barriers guard virtually every empty property on the block.\n\nUphill and across the street from Mehrabi’s home, workers installed orange netting along a steep decline, where burns left loose debris precariously above hillside homes.\n\n“They put this in two days ago, but I haven’t seen any landslides,” Mehrabi said. “I don’t think we’ll have an issue here.”\n\n- Share via\n\n‘We’re just doing what we can.’ Altadena residents prepare for big weekend storm\n\nNear Rubio Canyon Trail, plots where homes once stood soak up the rainfall. Many have prominent yard signs reading “Altadena is not for sale,” and all have prepared for the coming storm, wrapped with barriers and sand, with more piled on uphill portions.\n\nEvidence of the blaze can still be seen in blackened trees, partial homes and the many no trespassing signs.\n\nPlastic tarps, netting and sandbags suspended by rope are affixed to steep hills on Stonehill Drive. A pyramid of sandbags sits at the bottom.\n\nNearby, construction workers have placed tarps over damaged or partial roofs to seal a surviving home off from the weather.\n\n“We put these up back a couple months ago when there was a little rain,” one worker said. “We’re still doing some roofing work, so we think water is might still get in.”\n\nSharon Gray owns Eaton Dam Stables, just a few hundred feet from the ignition point in the canyon.\n\nWhen the fire raced through in January, her horse boarding business and the trailer she lived in were decimated. Despite the chaos, she and a small group reacted quickly, saving all 39 horses in Eaton Canyon.\n\nAs for the weather, she’s not as worried as other residents further uphill.\n\n“I don’t have any issue with what comes off the hills. We didn’t have issues with the rainstorm that came a couple months back.”\n\n“We’re just doing what we can,” she said. “Nothing looks like it wants to slough off New York drive, and they have those road barriers up still. We seem to be able handle rain. People in Altadena got evacuation warnings, so they’re more worried about it.”\n\n- Share via\n\nAtmospheric river storms shut down Knott’s Berry Farm, Six Flags Magic Mountain\n\nFriday’s storms also shut down a pair of Southern California amusement parks.\n\nAccording to the park websites for Knott’s Berry Farm and Six Flags Magic Mountain, both parks were closed Friday “due to inclement weather.”\n\nCustomers with Friday tickets are eligible to use them on any other day the park is open through the rest of the year, according to the websites.\n\nThe atmospheric storm that arrived in the region on Friday is expected to drop inches of rain through the weekend, with the heaviest downpours expected to hit Los Angeles County on Saturday.\n\n- Share via\n\nWhat to know about flash flooding\n\nAs their name suggests, flash floods can develop quickly, sometimes in just a few minutes and without visible signs of rain, according to Ready L.A. County.\n\nBe aware of flood hazards wherever you live, but especially if your home is in a low-lying area, near water or near a recently burned hillside, Ready L.A. County advises.\n\nA flood zone means the area has a potential for flooding during heavy rains or a weather disaster.\n\nTwo government agencies — the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services — provide information online about flood risks and other hazards across California. All you have to do is plug your address into the search tool to see what issues your home faces.\n\nOn the FEMA map, moderate- to low-risk flood areas are labeled with the letters B, C and X. In these areas the risk of being flooded is reduced but not eliminated. High-risk flood areas are labeled with the letters A and V.\n\nA community’s flood risk changes over time, so the National Food Insurance Program and the Federal Emergency Management Agency continuously work with communities across the country to identify and map flood risks.\n\n## Prepare for flooding\n\nPreparing for a flood — or any kind of emergency situation, for that matter — starts with you making a plan with your immediate family and neighbors.\n\nPart of that plan includes packing a go-bag that should have important documents (in a Ziplock or another type of waterproof bag), medication, an extra set of glasses (or contacts), a comfortable pair of shoes, a change of clothes, small bills (a number of $1 and $5 bills), a phone charger, flashlight, water and nonperishable food.\n\nIf you have pets, pack food, treats and an extra leash if you have one.\n\nKeep in mind every family member’s needs when creating your go-bag.\n\nEmily Montanez, associate director for L.A. County’s Office of Emergency Management, said you should try to create a small community of close neighbors to check in with when disaster strikes. Consider creating an emergency contact list on paper in the event your phone stops working or the battery dies and you can’t check the contacts there, she said.\n\n## Check the flood risk in your area\n\nUse a flood map to understand the flood risk in your community and whether your home is in a flood zone.\n\nFollow Emergency orders\n\nIf an evacuation is ordered or advised in your community, evacuate immediately.\n\nMontanez said when it comes to safety, listen to first responders.\n\n“If anyone receives a knock at their front door from someone in law enforcement or [from] the fire department, we definitely support taking the safest approach and evacuate your home,” she said.\n\nStay in the know about warnings and alerts by signing up with your local emergency mass notification system.\n\nLos Angeles County residents can sign up with Alert L.A. County, Notify L.A. and Nixle to receive notifications via text message or email. Stay updated on weather forecasts by tuning in to your local news broadcast station and checking the National Weather Service Los Angeles office website.\n\nIf a flood warning or watch is issued for your community and you have some time before evacuating, relocate valuables (particularly water-sensitive ones, such as laptops, tablets and smart kitchen devices) from lower to upper floors. You should also disconnect all electrical appliances or turn off electric circuits at the fuse box or circuit breaker panel.\n\nIf you have been evacuated, wait until authorities give the all-clear to return to your home.\n\n- Share via\n\nAltadena residents brace for storm impacts during burn scars\n\nNear Eaton Canyon in Altadena, the epicenter of January’s Eaton fire, driveways were dotted with white sandbags to help shield from debris runoff. Residents, including Andrew Beck, said they are concerned about soil toxicity during the flood threats.\n\nWalking near New York Drive carrying an umbrella, Beck often talks to neighbors near the foothills at the epicenter of the fire scar.\n\n“Some of the houses along Roosevelt, you’ll see lines of sandbags snaking,” he said. “I did the USC soil test program and it came back elevated levels above the EPA threshold, but I’m sort of zoning it out.”\n\nAt an empty lot on Loma Alta Drive, where a home was razed, builders had begun digging a foundation for a rebuild.\n\nThe pit was encircled by lines of hay-stuffed burlap to prevent flooding and debris from damaging the progress.

        "content": "# Papua New Guinea landslide: 670 feared dead, says UN migration agency\n\nFriday’s landslide in the north of Papua New Guinea is likely to have been far more deadly than first thought, Serhan Aktoprak, the country head of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Sunday.\n\nIn a media interview, Mr. Aktoprak said that the community in Yambali village, situated at the foot of a mountain in the remote Enga Province, is buried under between six to eight metres of soil.\n\n150 houses are believed to be buried, said the senior UN official, around 90 more than previously reported. Some 670 people are believed to be under the soil and “hopes of finding them alive are shrinking”.\n\nIOM has six aid workers on site, alongside personnel from other UN agencies, NGOs and government agencies. The conditions remain dangerous for the workers; water continues to run down the mountain, and the land is still sliding. Falling boulders are also affecting relief efforts.\n\nThe landslide has displaced around 1,000 people, and it is feared that the death toll will rise. Mr. Aktoprak said that helpers are using any available implements, such as spades and sticks, in an attempt to locate bodies.\n\nDebris covering large stretches of the single highway into Enga Province has limited access to the rescue site, but heavy machinery is expected to arrive on Sunday to assist in recovery efforts.\n\nIn a statement released on Saturday, the United Nations Office in Papua New Guinea said that communications infrastructure and access roads to the affected site have been damaged.\n\nAn Emergency Response Coordination Team has been set up to coordinate and lead relief efforts, comprising the Enga Provincial Disaster Coordination Office, the Department of Health, Department of Provincial Works, police, Defence Force, and the United Nations.\n\nAn initial rapid impact assessment conducted by the Team identified immediate need for food, shelter and medical supplies.\n\n“The United Nations is monitoring the situation very closely, in collaboration with national and provincial government authorities, including other partners to determine the extent of damage, casualties and possible assistance that may be required for those impacted”, the statement concluded.",

        "content": "An unusually strong storm system has reached Southern California, raising fears that the rain could unleash a threat that has been lingering in the burn scars of wildfires that ravaged Los Angeles communities in recent years.\n\nCalled debris flows, these fast-moving slurries of floodwater and sediment can hurtle down slopes carrying cars, trees and even boulders with them.\n\nThey’re like “a flood on steroids,” said Jason Kean, a research hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey’s landslide hazards program. “It’s really hard to stop these things. The best thing to do is get out of the way.”\n\nForecasters expect the heaviest rain Friday into Saturday night; predictions are for wet days through next week. Storms may stretch from Santa Barbara County south to Los Angeles County, and could spread inland to parts of Orange County and the Inland Empire.\n\nBurn scars — slicked by fire and stripped of plants — are especially vulnerable. A storm after the Thomas Fire in 2018 spurred debris flows in Montecito that killed 23 people. And in February, a debris flow in the Palisades Fire burn zone swept a Los Angeles Fire Department member and his SUV into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Public Works warns that there’s a risk of moderate debris and mudflows capable of blocking roadways and endangering some structures in the burn scars of almost a dozen fires — including January’s Eaton, Hurst and Palisades fires.\n\nThe county has issued evacuation warnings, as well as some targeted evacuation orders for specific properties “at higher risk for mud and debris flows impacts.”\n\nThe public works department says that most burned properties have been cleared of fire debris, and the rest have been shored up with gravel bags and other materials to keep debris in place.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom also announced today that more than 400 personnel and resources including fire engines, helicopters and search and rescue teams have been pre-deployed to Southern California counties.\n\n“It’s a pretty serious situation,” said National Weather Service meteorologist David Gomberg.\n\nBy Friday morning, the storm had already unleashed up to 5 inches of rain in parts of Santa Barbara County, Gomberg said, and Southern California is bracing for more.\n\nThere’s also the possibility of thunderstorms, small tornadoes, and a worrying amount of rain hitting the Eaton and Palisades burn scars. Even just a half-an-inch to 0.6 inches of rain could trigger a debris flow in these areas, said Gomberg, who added that his office is forecasting between half an inch to one inch per hour in these areas.\n\n“And the more you exceed the threshold, the probability of a more damaging debris flow increases,” he said.\n\nWe spoke with the U.S. Geological Survey’s Kean, an expert on debris flows after wildfires, about what to expect. This conversation has been edited and condensed.\n\n**As this storm really takes hold in LA and Southern California, I’m hearing a lot of concern about it hitting areas that burned this past year, including in the Eaton and Palisades fires. Why is this such a big concern? What could happen?**\n\nLast January those fires removed much of the vegetation on really steep slopes, and that made those slopes really vulnerable to erosion during intense rainfall. That protective blanket of vegetation is gone, and heavy rain can rapidly make a flash flood. And that flood, in some cases, can pick up material and turn into what we call a debris flow — which is like a flood on steroids.\n\nThese burn areas are still vulnerable, even though it’s now many months after the fire and there have been flows already. There’s still plenty of material that could be mobilized. So the threat’s still there. And so we know they’re bad actors, and we’re concerned they could be bad actors again.\n\n**I’m hearing a lot of different terms: mudslide, debris flows, landslide. What are the differences, and which ones are the burn scars at risk for? **\n\nLandslide is an umbrella term that captures all kinds of mass movements, from rock falls to debris flows — these floods on steroids — to big, slow movers. The type of flow that we’re most concerned about in a recent burn area is a debris flow. It’s also called a mudslide. But geologists don’t like to use the word mudslide as much because it sounds like there’s some mud on your driveway — not a big issue, not something that could kill you. And these things, if you’re in the wrong spot at the wrong time, they can cause serious damage.\n\n**You called it a flood on steroids. What happens in a debris flow? **\n\nFlash floods are bad, and they can cause lots of problems, too. They can get even worse if they pick up enough sediment to turn into the consistency of wet concrete. But it’s worse than just concrete, because it can contain boulders the size of cars. And, very close to the mountain front, it can move very quickly — faster than you can run. And when it gets all bulked up with debris, the rocks, the gravel, the mud, trees, the flow can be a lot bigger. It just turns into a different animal.\n\nNow, debris flows pack a bigger punch than floods, but thankfully, they don’t have as long of reach. So usually, the debris flows are confined really close to the mountain fronts. That’s where they put those debris basins to catch them. But if there isn’t one protection like that, then they can travel downslope and impact neighborhoods, and then flooding can extend even further down.\n\n**Is there something about Southern California that makes it higher risk?**\n\nSouthern California’s kind of the world capital for these kinds of events. It’s got this combination of very steep topography, like the San Gabriel Mountains that just shoot right up, Santa Monica mountains, Santa Ynez — very steep topography. It burns fairly frequently. And then there are a lot of people living very close to the mountain front, so that’s what puts the risk up.\n\nThe thing about a burn area is it takes much less rainfall to cause a problem than it would in unburned conditions. So we’ve now made the slopes really vulnerable. They’re extra steep. There’s a lot of people there. That’s why the risk is so high.\n\nWe’ve seen debris flows in Northern California burn areas as well. It’s not just a Southern California problem, and it’s not just a California problem.\n\n**Is there anything that could have been done to reduce this risk? Anything that should be done now? **\n\nNot long after the fires, in particular the Palisades Fire, (there were) a number of fairly widespread debris flows that disrupted the roads. There were also, in the Eaton fire, floods and debris flows there. Thankfully there’s a dense network of LA County debris basins, which are designed to catch the material before it enters neighborhoods, and those largely saved the day.\n\nPlanners have planned ahead and put in these debris basins — these big, giant holes in the ground — designed to catch the material. That’s the best defense against these. They’re not everywhere, but there is a good network of protection. Other than that, it’s really hard to stop these things.\n\n**What should people who live near the recent burn scars know? What should they do now, as the rain starts? **\n\nThe best thing you could do is, if you’re really close to a drainage in one of these burn areas, is to get out of the way. You’re going to get a heads up from the National Weather Service, who’s closely monitoring the rainstorms. They know how much rain it’s going to take to cause a problem, and they’ll get out warnings, and local authorities will reach out to get people out of the way. So there’s a lot of eyes on the situation. And so at this point, the best thing to do is listen to the weather service, listen to local authorities.\n\nIf they ask you to get out of the way, take their advice. These things can happen really fast if there is an intense burst of rain, a flash flood, where debris flow can start within minutes.\n\n**So there is no escaping a debris flow once it starts? **\n\nIt’s pretty difficult. If you have a two-story home and you happen to be there at the wrong time, get up to that second floor for sure. Fight like heck if you get trapped in one. But best to be out of the way.",

        "content": "# UN warns of ‘significant’ disease risk after Papua New Guinea landslide\n\n*The UN’s migration agency says displaced residents urgently need clean water, purification tablets and food supplies.*\n\nPapua New Guinea has ruled out finding more survivors under the rubble of last week’s massive landslide, as a UN agency warned of a “significant risk of disease outbreak” among displaced residents, who are yet to receive sufficient supplies of food and clean water.\n\nSix days after a mountainside community in Enga province was buried in a sea of soil, boulders and debris, the United Nations’ migration agency (IOM) said on Thursday that water sources had become tainted and the risk of disease was soaring.\n\n## Recommended Stories\n\nlist of 3 items- list 1 of 3‘A miracle’: Couple survives Papua New Guinea landslide that ‘buried 2,000’\n- list 2 of 3Papuans head to Indonesian court to protect forests from palm oil\n- list 3 of 3Papua New Guinea evacuating landslide villages as hopes for survivors fade\n\nMuch of the area’s water flows through the landslide site – now a 600 metre-long (1,970 feet) graveyard of a still undetermined number of people.\n\n“The creeks now flowing from the debris are contaminated, posing a significant risk of disease outbreak”, the UN’s migration agency told partners in a rapid assessment report.\n\n“There are no methods being used to treat the water to make it safe for drinking,” it said, warning of diarrhoea and malaria.\n\nFor much of the past week, residents of villages affected by the landslide have been digging through countless tonnes of earth in the search for buried relatives.\n\nWitnesses reported the stench of dead bodies had become overwhelming.\n\n“No bodies are expected to be alive under the debris at this point, so it’s a full recovery operation to recover any human remains,” Enga province disaster committee chairman Sandis Tsaka told the Reuters news agency.\n\nOfficials and rescuers only managed to recover 11 bodies. At least two people had survived and were rescued three days after the disaster.\n\nMore than 2,000 people may have been buried alive, according to the country’s government.\n\nA UN estimate put the death toll at about 670, while a businessman and former official told Reuters that it was closer to 160.\n\n## ‘Treacherous terrain’\n\nAccording to IOM, getting clean water, purification tablets and “lifesaving food supplies” to the site are the top priorities of the agency.\n\nBut heavy equipment and aid have been slow to arrive because of the treacherous mountain terrain, a damaged bridge on the main road, and tribal unrest in the area.\n\nTsaka said it has not been possible to get such machinery, engineers or technical offers to the site yet “because of the risk of unstable land movement”.\n\nAid agencies and foreign donors are also concerned that unreliable estimates about the number of dead, injured and displaced are complicating the international response.\n\n\n\n“The absence of accurate and timely information on the affected areas and population hinders effective planning and delivery of humanitarian assistance,” the IOM warned.\n\nSatellite imagery experts, disaster relief professionals, and Papua New Guinea’s officials and diplomats have all told the AFP news agency that the 2,000 death toll provided earlier by the government is likely vastly inflated.\n\nTsaka, the Enga provincial administrator, said on Thursday that the number of dead was probably in the “hundreds” rather than thousands.\n\nHe said traumatised survivors have been unable to provide reliable information on loved ones who are still missing.\n\nWith some key teams still struggling to reach the disaster zone, he said Papua New Guinea’s response workers were “keeping our heads above water”.",

        "content": "# Papua New Guinea government says Friday’s landslide buried 2,000 people and formally asks for help\n\nEstimates of the casualties have varied widely since the disaster occurred, and it was not immediately clear how officials arrived the number of people affected\n\nThe Papua New Guinea government said a landslide Friday buried more than 2,000 people and has formally asked for international help.\n\nThe government figure is around three times more than a United Nations’ estimate of 670.\n\nIn a letter seen by The Associated Press to the United Nations resident coordinator dated Sunday, the acting director of the South Pacific island nation’s National Disaster Center said the landslide “buried more than 2000 people alive” and caused “major destruction.”\n\nEstimates of the casualties have varied widely since the disaster occurred, and it was not immediately clear how officials arrived the number of people affected.\n\nAustralia prepared on Monday to send aircraft and other equipment to help at the site of a deadly landslide in Papua New Guinea as overnight rains in the South Pacific nation’s mountainous interior raised fears that the tons of rubble that buried hundreds of villagers could become dangerously unstable.\n\nAustralian Defense Minister Richard Marles said his officials have been talking with their Papua New Guinea counterparts since Friday, when a mountainside collapsed on Yambali village in Enga province.\n\n“The exact nature of the support that we do provide will play out over the coming days,” Marles told Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n\n“We’ve got obviously airlift capacity to get people there. There may be other equipment that we can bring to bear in terms of the search and rescue and all of that we are talking through with PNG right now,” Marles added.\n\nPapua New Guinea is Australia’s nearest neighbor and the countries are developing closer defense ties as part of an Australian effort to counter China’s growing influence in the region. Australia is also the most generous provider of foreign aid to its former colony, which became independent in 1975.\n\nHeavy rain fell for two hours overnight in the provincial capital of Wabag, 60 kilometers (35 miles) from the devastated village. A weather report was not immediately available from Yambali, where communications are limited.\n\nBut emergency responders were concerned about the impact of rain on the already unstable mass of debris lying 6 to 8 meters (20 to 26 feet) deep over an area the size of three to four football fields.\n\nAn excavator donated by a local builder Sunday became the first piece of heavy earth-moving machinery brought in to help villagers who have been digging with shovels and farming tools to find bodies. Working around the still-shifting debris is treacherous.\n\nSerhan Aktoprak, the chief of the International Organization for Migration’s mission in Papua New Guinea, said water was seeping between the debris and the earth below, increasing the risk of a further landslide.\n\nHe did not expect to learn the weather conditions at Yambali until Monday afternoon.\n\n“What really worries me personally very much is the weather, weather, weather,” Aktoprak said. “Because the land is still sliding. Rocks are falling,” he added.\n\nPapua New Guinea’s defense minister, Billy Joseph, and the government’s National Disaster Center director, Laso Mana, flew on Sunday in an Australian military helicopter from the capital of Port Moresby to Yambali, 600 kilometers (370 miles) to the northwest, to gain a firsthand perspective of what is needed.\n\nMana’s office posted a photo of him at Yambali handing a local official a check for 500,000 kina ($130,000) to buy emergency supplies for the 4,000 displaced survivors.\n\nThe purpose of the visit was to decide whether Papua New Guinea’s government needed to officially request more international support.\n\nEarth-moving equipment used by Papua New Guinea’s military was being transported to the disaster scene 400 kilometers (250 miles) from the east coast city of Lae.\n\nTraumatized villagers are divided over whether heavy machinery should be allowed to dig up and potentially further damage the bodies of their buried relatives, officials said.\n\n*Sign up for** our weekly newsletter** to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition*\n\n## Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo\n\n¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?\n\nSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.\n\nFlecha## Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.\n\nSi quieres compartir tu cuenta, cambia tu suscripción a la modalidad Premium, así podrás añadir otro usuario.

        "content": "San Bernardino County departments continue to provide critical support to residents impacted by last week’s severe weather event due to remnants of Tropical Storm Mario, which brought heavy rains, flooding and mudslides to mountain and desert communities.\n\nOn Thursday, Sept. 18, a powerful storm cell triggered mud and debris flows from the San Bernardino National Forest El Dorado Fire burn scar areas to come down into the Oak Glen and Forest Falls communities. The debris flows moved across the Yucaipa Ridge area, destroying portions of the ridge and sending mud and debris rushing into Forest Falls and Oak Glen. The same storm cell also caused severe washouts along Highway 38, damaging sections that are expected to remain closed for months.\n\nAdditional rainfall in the desert region raised flooding concerns in Twentynine Palms, Landers, Barstow and Trona.\n\nWith the arrival of the storm, County Emergency Services activated the Emergency Operations Center to assist in a coordinated response. County Fire, CAL FIRE, the Sheriff’s Department and Emergency Services led unified command, supported by County Public Works and partner agencies, including Caltrans and the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services.\n\n“Once again, our first responders and county departments came together quickly to protect lives, restore access, and support residents in difficult circumstances,” said Board of Supervisors Chairman and Third District Supervisor Dawn Rowe. “To the families and businesses affected, we stand with you and will continue to advocate for the assistance you need. We thank the public for heeding safety warnings while crews work to restore normalcy to the affected communities.”\n\nTo mitigate future mud and debris flows in federal land in the San Bernardino National Forest from impacting these communities, the county will continue advocating for a strong partnership with the federal government and the United States Forest Service.\n\n**Rescue and safety operations**\n\nAs the storm struck on Thursday, Sept. 18, motorists stranded along Highway 38 were rescued by Caltrans. County Fire’s Harrison Canyon hand crew assisted with digging out residences in Forest Falls impacted by mud and debris.\n\nIn Oak Glen, mud and debris blocked multiple roads and creek crossings. Residents sheltered safely in place with patrols providing support, while Public Works crews worked around the clock to clear debris and restore access for both residents and emergency services.\n\n**Cleanup and recovery**\n\nIn Forest Falls, slides and roadway compromises were reported from Canyon Drive through Slide Creek and Holy Pines. Along Highway 38, significant washouts — including one near Hawthorne Creek estimated at 50 feet deep and a quarter mile wide — were documented, with additional washouts near South Fork and North Fork Park under evaluation by Caltrans.\n\nPublic Works’ road and flood crews are operating extended shifts, with loaders, dump trucks, graders and contract support clearing roads and flood channels. Valley of the Falls Drive has been reopened to emergency width and Potato Canyon has been cleared to a single lane, though closures remain in place until work is completed.\n\n• Oak Glen: 19 pieces of heavy equipment have been active, removing more than 1,770 cubic yards from the Oak Glen Channel and 3,100 cubic yards from Birch Creek Channel. Road Operations removed 1,600 cubic yards of sediments and debris from the roadways.\n\n• Forest Falls: Eight pieces of heavy equipment and two ground crew members are actively clearing debris and restoring access. Road Operations removed 2,000 cubic yards of sediments and debris from the roadways.\n\n• Glass and Seven Oaks: Road Operations removed 5,000 cubic yards of sediments and debris from the roadways.\n\nFor updates on county road closures, visit dpw.sbcounty.gov/operations/road-closures.\n\n**Continuing vigilance**\n\nLooking ahead, more showers are possible Friday and Saturday, and there is a chance for new storms as early as Sunday from Tropical Storm Narda, which continues to develop off the coast of southern Mexico. County officials remind residents to remain prepared and alert for rapidly changing conditions.\n\n**Understanding the risks of mud and debris flows**\n\nThese recent adverse weather events highlight the increased flood and mudslide risks caused by wildfire damage. To stay safe, residents are urged to remember:\n\n- Heed evacuation warnings and orders: Leave immediately if instructed. Debris flows and flash floods can happen suddenly, with little warning. Have a family communication plan in place.\n- “Turn Around, Don’t Drown”: Never attempt to drive or walk through floodwaters. Just six inches of moving water can sweep a person off their feet, and deeper flows can carry vehicles away.\n- Know what to do if flooding occurs: If indoors, stay inside. If outdoors, seek higher ground immediately and avoid flood channels and flowing water.\n\n**Sign up for emergency alerts**\n\nSign up for the San Bernardino County Telephone Emergency Notification System (TENS) to receive emergency alerts on your phone.\n\nStay informed by monitoring the National Weather Service – San Diego office for the latest updates and warnings.\n\nFor the latest information on road closures, safety alerts, and recovery progress, visit Prepare.SBCounty.gov.\n\n**Resources**\n\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara and the California Department of Insurance provided resources for residents who have been impacted by the mudslides:\n\n**Lara’s alert**on coverage for floods and mudslides caused by wildfire burn scars.**Fact sheet**on coverage for flood, mudflow, mudslide, debris flow, and landslide events.**Bulletin 2025-3**outlining coverage guidance for recent wildfire-related flood and earth movement claims.\n\nThe Department of Insurance has also provided a public assistance hotline available in every language: **(800) 927-4357**.\n\n**Additional County Update News – September 25, 2025**\n\n- County urges residents to be prepared for potential rain this weekend\n- Board actions, Sept. 23\n- County officials warn taxpayers of property tax payment scam\n- Southern California Edison Wildfire Safety Meeting\n- Building resilient communities starts with you\n- Spreen Subaru of San Bernardino partners with County Animal Care and ARFF this October\n- County Library offers senior programs at Mentone Senior Center and Library\n- New pickleball courts open at MacKay Park in Lake Arrowhead\n- San Bernardino County destinations: Joshua Tree National Park\n- Call for submissions: Share your favorite San Bernardino County destinations\n- San Bernardino County history: Mentone\n- Things to do in San Bernardino County\n- Pet of the Week",

        "content": "# Papua New Guinea landslide buried more than 2,000 people, government says\n\nSYDNEY, May 27 (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea's massive landslide three days ago buried more than 2,000 people, the government said on Monday, as treacherous terrain impeded aid and lowered hopes of finding survivors.\n\nThe National Disaster Centre gave the new number in a letter to the U.N., which had put possible deaths at more than 670.\n\nThe variance reflects the remote site and the difficulty in getting an accurate population estimate. The Pacific island nation's last credible census was in 2000 and many people live in isolated mountain villages.\n\nDefence Minister Billy Joseph said 4,000 people had been living in the six remote villages in the Maip-Mulitaka area in Enga province, where the landslide occurred in the early hours of Friday while most were asleep.\n\nMore than 150 houses were buried beneath debris almost two storeys high. Rescuers heard screams from beneath the earth.\n\n\"I have 18 of my family members being buried under the debris and soil that I am standing on, and a lot more family members in the village I cannot count,\" resident Evit Kambu told Reuters. \"But I cannot retrieve the bodies so I am standing here helplessly.\"\n\nMore than 72 hours after the landslide, residents were still using spades, sticks and bare hands to try and shift debris. Only five bodies had been found, according to the provincial authority.\n\n## FUNERAL\n\nVillagers held one funeral on Monday: mourners walked behind the coffin weeping, according to U.N. official's video.\n\nHeavy equipment and assistance have been slow to arrive due to the remote location while tribal warfare nearby has made aid workers travel in convoys escorted by soldiers and return to the provincial capital, 60 km (37 miles) away, at night.\n\nEight people were killed and 30 houses burnt down on Saturday in the violence, a U.N. agency official said. Aid convoys on Monday passed the still smoking remains of houses.\n\nThe first excavator only reached the disaster site late on Sunday, according to a U.N. official.\n\nMany people are still unsure whether loved ones were caught as villagers often move between homes of friends and relatives, according to Matthew Hewitt Tapus, a pastor in the PNG capital Port Moresby whose home village is close to the disaster.\n\n\"It's not like everyone is in the same house at the same time, so you have fathers who don’t know where their children are, mothers who don’t know where husbands are, it's chaotic,\" he told Reuters by phone.\n\n## 'CHANCES SLIM'\n\nJoseph said the defence operations chief was sent to the disaster scene within 24 hours with assistance from the Australian Defence Force, and a PNG defence engineering team was on site, as well as a military helicopter for evacuations.\n\nThe government has requested a New Zealand Defence Force geotechnical team to assess possibly unstable land nearby which would making heavy earth-moving equipment dangerous, he said.\n\nThe province needs to build capacity for disaster warnings, the minister added, saying the government would rebuild the villages and reopen the main highway to the town and gold mine at Porgera.\n\nAustralia announced an initial A$2.5 million ($1.66 million) aid package late on Monday and said it would send technical experts to help rescue and recovery.\n\nChina, which has been wooing Pacific island nations, also said it would provide assistance.\n\nRain, unstable ground and flowing water was making it extremely dangerous for residents and rescue teams to clear debris, according to Serhan Aktoprak, the chief of the U.N. migration agency's mission in PNG.\n\nMore than 250 homes have been evacuated, he said, with more than 1,250 people displaced.\n\nSome residents do not want heavy machinery interrupting mourning, the U.N. official added. \"At this point, people I think are realising that the chances are very slim that anyone can basically be taken out alive.\"\n\n($1 = 1.5053 Australian dollars)\n\nSign up here.\n\nReporting by Renju Jose, Lewis Jackson and Kirsty Needham in Sydney; Additional reporting by Liz Lee in Beijing; Editing by Praveen Menon and Michael Perry\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

        "content": "# Trump survives assassination attempt at campaign rally, as it unfolded\n\nThe FBI is investigating Saturday’s shooting at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania as an attempted assassination and act of domestic terror. However authorities say, a motive has not yet been identified.\n\n*Today’s live coverage has ended. See what you missed below and **follow live election updates for July 15, 2024.*\n\nLaw enforcement officials are working to learn more about the 20-year-old who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday.\n\nIn a briefing Sunday, FBI officials told reporters they had yet to determine what motivated the shooter to open fire from a nearby rooftop, killing one spectator and critically injuring two others before he was shot dead by the Secret Service. The FBI believes the shooter acted alone.\n\n**What to know:**\n\n**More on the shooter:**The FBI named Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the suspect behind the apparent assassination attempt. In a briefing with reporters, FBI officials said the AR-style rifle used in the attack was legally purchased by the gunman’s father.**Latest on the victims:**The man who was killed at the rally was identified as Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief from the area who used his body to shield his family. At least two other people were injured: David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania. Both were listed in stable condition as of Sunday.**Biden delivers Oval Office address:**In a prime-time national address, the president said “we must not go down” the road of political violence in America and called for unity.\n\n## Trump in ‘great spirits’ Sunday\n\nDonald Trump spent much of Sunday on the phone with friends, news hosts and local and foreign officials the day after he was injured in an assassination attempt.\n\nOhio Pastor Darrell Scott, a longtime ally, said Trump “was in great spirits” when they spoke Sunday morning, hours after the shooting.\n\n“He was great, like he always is. He didn’t even make a big deal of it,” Scott said. “He was actually trying to downplay it somewhat, asking how I was doing.”\n\nFormer RNC chair Reince Priebus, who also served as Trump’s White House chief of staff, told ABC’s “This Week” that Trump was “grateful for the miracle of what happened, in his case. ... One quarter inch turned the other direction and we’re obviously talking about something very different this morning.”\n\n## WATCH: AP explains how misinformation filled the internet after Trump assassination attempt\n\nWithin minutes of the gunfire, the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump spawned a vast sea of claims reflecting the frightening uncertainties of the moment as well as America’s fevered, polarized political climate.\n\n## WATCH: Activists in Milwaukee for GOP convention keep march plans in wake of shooting at Trump rally\n\nActivists gathering in Milwaukee for the first day of Republican National Convention say they’ll continue their long-awaited plans for marches and rallies Monday in the wake of an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. (AP video by Nathan Ellegren)\n\n## WATCH: AP journalists recall witnessing the attempted assassination of former President Trump\n\nAssociated Press journalists recall the scene when a shooter fired at former President Donald Trump during a rally.\n\n## Leading Christian conservative calls shooting “wake-up call” on rhetoric and social media\n\nTony Perkins, among the most influential Christian conservatives in the Republican Party, was preparing to mount a confrontation with convention planners over his disdain for how debate during the RNC’s platform committee was shut down on Monday, all but eliminating objections to the Trump campaign’s desire to soften language on abortion.\n\nThe attempted assassination changed all that, Perkins told The Associated Press after a prayer service in suburban Milwaukee Sunday evening.\n\n“We live in a violent society. And we run the risk of becoming callous to it. And if we become callous to it, we’re going to have more of it,” Perkins said. “I’m hoping and praying it’s a wake-up call in many ways.”\n\n“So, as a result, I’m stepping back from forcing the issue on the platform,” he added. “More divisiveness would not be healthy.”\n\nPerkins called social media “a contagion” for toxic rhetoric passed along by people who do not feel that they’re heard by their government or leaders, and attributed the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol in part to the notion of overheated online rage.\n\n“We need to stop,” he said.\n\nAnd while thanking God during the service for Trump’s survival, Perkins told more than 100 in the Pewaukee church, “Lord, I believe that our nation is at such a volatile moment that yesterday could have torn this nation right in half.”\n\n## Motive of man who tried to assassinate Donald Trump remains elusive\n\nThe 20-year-old man who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump first came to law enforcement’s attention at Saturday’s rally when spectators noticed him acting strangely outside the campaign event. The tip sparked a frantic search, but officers were unable to find him before he managed to get on a roof, where he opened fire.\n\nIn the wake of the shooting that killed one spectator, investigators are hunting for any clues about what may have drove Thomas Matthew Crooks, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, to carry out the shocking attack. The FBI said they were investigating it as a potential act of domestic terrorism, but the absence of a clear ideological motive by the man shot dead by Secret Service allowed conspiracy theories to flourish.\n\nThe FBI said it believes Crooks, who had bomb-making materials in the car he drove to the rally, acted alone. Investigators have found no threatening comments on social media accounts or ideological positions that could help explain what led him to target Trump.\n\nCrooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022. His senior year, Crooks was among several students given an award for math and science, according to a Tribune-Review story at the time.\n\nHe tried out for the school’s rifle team but was turned away because he was a bad shooter, said Frederick Mach, a current captain of the team who was a few years behind Crooks at the school.\n\nJason Kohler, who said he attended the same high school but did not share any classes with Crooks, said Crooks was bullied at school and sat alone at lunch time. Other students mocked him for the clothes he wore, which included hunting outfits, Kohler said.\n\n*▶ Read more about **what’s known about the shooter*\n\n## Trumps tells Washington Examiner he has rewritten his speech for the RNC\n\nFormer President Donald Trump told The Washington Examiner that he has rewritten the speech he was set to deliver at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday after being the target of an attempted assassination at his rally Saturday.\n\n“The speech I was going to give on Thursday was going to be a humdinger,” he told the news outlet in an article posted Sunday evening.\n\nIn the interview, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee says he will now call for a new effort at national unity, noting that people from different political views have called him.\n\n“This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would’ve been two days ago,” he said.\n\nTrump also reflected on the moment a bullet pierced the upper part of his right ear. He said he was saved from death because he turned from the crowd to look at a screen showing off a chart he was referring to.\n\n“That reality is just setting in,” he told the news outlet as he boarded his plane in Bedminster, New Jersey, for Milwaukee. “I rarely look away from the crowd. Had I not done that in that moment, well, we would not be talking today, would we?”\n\n## WATCH: Secret Service Agent who survived Reagan assassination attempt evaluates Trump rally shooting\n\nFormer Secret Service Agent Tim McCarthy was shot on the day there was an attempt to assassinate former President Ronald Reagan. As he watched the shooting at the Trump rally unfold on Saturday he noticed similar failures in the attempts to protect the president.\n\n## WATCH: Trump rally shooting victim remembered by fellow firefighters\n\nThe former fire chief who was killed at a Pennsylvania rally for Donald Trump is remembered by his colleagues as a man who served his community. (AP Video/Jessie Wardarski)\n\n## WATCH: Classmate says suspect in Trump shooting was loner who was bullied at school\n\nA classmate of Thomas Matthew Crooks, suspected of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump, said the 20-year-old suspect was frequently bullied and sat alone at lunch time at their high school in Bethel Park, Penn. (AP Video/Terry Chea)\n\n## WATCH: Biden’s full address from the Oval Office\n\n## ‘In America we resolve our differences at the ballot box,’ Biden says\n\nBiden says that during the Republican National Convention, he has “no doubt” Republicans will “criticize my record and offer their own vision for this country.” But he promised in campaigning to lay out “our vision.”\n\nHe used the address to urge all Americans not to accept an escalation in political violence as normal.\n\n“We debate and disagree, we compare and contrast ... but in America we resolve our differences at the ballot box,” Biden said in his address.\n\nHe added: “Politics must never be a literal battlefield. God forbid a killing field.”\n\n## Biden: ‘It’s time to cool it down’\n\nBiden spoke for about five minutes from the Oval Office and noted that the Republican National Convention was opening in Milwaukee on Monday, while he himself would be traveling the country to campaign for reelection.\n\nHe said passions would run high on both sides and that the stakes of the election were enormous.\n\nBut the president added, “it’s time to cool it down” and noted not just the weekend attack on Trump but also the possibility of election-year violence on multiple fronts.\n\n## Biden decries political violence in address from Oval Office\n\nPresident Joe Biden says “we can’t, we must not go down” the road of political violence in American after Saturday’s attempted Trump assassination.\n\nIn a prime-time national address, Biden said that political passions can run high but “we must never descend into violence.”\n\n“We can do this,” Biden implored, saying the nation was founded on a democracy that gave reason and balance a chance to prevail over brute force. “American democracy — where arguments are made in good faith. American democracy where the rule of law is respected. Where decency, dignity, fair play aren’t just quaint notions, they’re living, breathing realities.”\n\n## Minutes away: Biden expected to deliver rare Oval Office remarks\n\nThe president is planning to deliver extended remarks to the nation in an address from the Oval Office starting at 8 p.m. EDT.\n\nHis campaign said the president would touch on “the need for every American to come together” to end political violence in the U.S.\n\n## Canada’s Trudeau condemns attempted assassination of Trump\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with former President Trump on Sunday.\n\n“The Prime Minister condemned yesterday’s appalling assassination attempt and reiterated there’s no place for political violence. The Prime Minister wished the former President well and offered condolences to the shooting victims and to the family of Corey Comperatore,” Trudeau’s office said in a statement.\n\n## Trump’s arrival in Milwaukee for the RNC\n\nThe former president said earlier Sunday that he was going to delay his trip because of the attempted assassination, but then decided he didn’t want it to force a change in his schedule.\n\nTrump is not expected to speak at the RNC until Thursday night.\n\n## JUST IN: Trump arrives in Milwaukee for Republican National Convention one day after attempted assassination\n\n## Staff member of US representative no longer employed after social post on Trump assassination attempt\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson says one of his staff members is no longer employed after he learned of a post she made on social media.\n\nScreenshots of her apparent Facebook post, which was related to the attempted assassination of Trump, circulated on social media after the shooting.\n\nThe screenshots showed a post in which the staffer appeared to say she does not condone violence but suggested the shooter should get “shooting lessons” and should not have missed.\n\nThe AP was not able to view the user’s private Facebook profile to identify whether the post was still up.\n\n## Wisconsin governor asks for reconsideration on a widened no-gun zone around RNC\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers is asking officials to revisit a prior decision that allows people to bring guns within blocks of the Republican National Convention after an assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, a person familiar with the matter told the Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nEvers believes additional steps need to be taken to keep the convention’s attendees, law enforcement and the local community safe, the person said. The person could not discuss details of the request publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe request was made to the U.S. Secret Service, which would bring it to the Republican National Committee, the person said.\n\nThe Secret Service said at a news conference Sunday that they were confident in their existing security plan and hadn’t made any changes following the shooting.\n\n## Within minutes of the Trump rally shooting, misinformation started flying\n\nThe cloudburst of speculation and conjecture as Americans turned to the internet for news about the Trump rally shooting is the latest sign of how social media has emerged as a dominant source of information — and misinformation — for many, and a contributor to the distrust and turbulence now driving American politics.\n\nMentions of Trump on social media soared up to 17 times the average daily amount in the hours after the shooting, according to PeakMetrics, a cyber firm that tracks online narratives. Many of those mentions were expressions of sympathy for Trump or calls for unity. But many others made unfounded, fantastical claims.\n\n“We saw things like ‘The Chinese were behind it,’ or ‘Antifa was behind it,’ or ‘the Biden administration did it.’ We also saw a claim that the RNC was behind it,’” said Paul Bartel, senior intelligence analyst at PeakMetrics. “Everyone is just speculating. No one really knows what’s going on. They go online to try to figure it out.”\n\n*▶ Take a look at some of **the unsubstantiated claims that surfaced online following the shooting*\n\n## Former fire chief who died at Trump rally used his body to shield family from gunfire\n\nCorey Comperatore’s quick decision to use his body as a shield against the bullets flying toward his wife and daughter rang true to the close friends and neighbors, who loved and respected the proud 50-year-old Trump supporter.\n\n“He’s a literal hero,” said Mike Morehouse, who lived next to Comperatore for the last eight years.\n\nAt least two other people were injured at the rally: David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, according to the Pennsylvania State Police. Both were listed in stable condition as of Sunday.\n\n*▶ Read more on the** Trump rally shooting victims*\n\n## WATCH: Reagan survived an assassination attempt and his response changed the trajectory of his presidency\n\nThe assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump has parallels to the last time a president or presidential candidate was wounded — in 1981, when Ronald Reagan was nearly killed by an assailant’s bullet.\n\n## WATCH: Reactions from RNC convention site: ‘Everybody’s on eggshells here’\n\nPeople near where the Republican National Convention is taking place in Milwaukee are reacting to the attempted assassination of the former president and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. (AP video: Carrie Antlfinger)\n\n## A timeline of the assassination attempt on former President Trump\n\nThe shooter at the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the former president was speaking, according to an AP analysis of more than a dozen photos and videos from the scene, as well as satellite imagery of the site.\n\nHere’s some of the key moments in the timeline of the shooting:\n\n### 6:02 p.m. EDT\n\n— Trump takes the stage to the strains of “God Bless the U.S.A.” He waves at the cheering crowd and begins his regular rally speech, with spectators both in front of him and behind him on risers.\n\n### Around 6:10 p.m.\n\n— After rally-goers notice a man climbing on the top of the roof of a nearby building, a local law enforcement officer climbs to the roof, according to two law enforcement officials.\n\n— A man identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks points his rifle at the officer, who retreats down the ladder, the officials said.\n\n— Crooks then quickly fires, according to the officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.\n\n— As the first pop rings out, Trump says, “Oh.” He raises his hand to his right ear and looks at it before quickly crouching to the ground behind his lectern.\n\n— Secret Service agents rush to the stage and pile atop the former president to shield him.\n\n— Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former fire chief attending the rally, is shot and killed. Pennsylvania Gov.

        "content": "# Donald Trump rally shooting: Minute-by-minute timeline of what happened\n\n*The FBI suspects a 20-year-old man to be behind the failed assassination attempt on the former US president.*\n\nFormer United States President Donald Trump has survived an assassination bid during a campaign rally in Butler County, Pennsylvania months ahead of the presidential elections.\n\nTrump, who was injured in the right ear, is “safe”. The Republican candidate was escorted off the stage with blood on his ear and cheek after a gunman fired from a building 120-150m (395-165 feet) away outside the rally venue. He has since arrived at his residence in New Jersey.\n\nOne spectator was killed and two others critically injured in the attack, which took place at the Butler Farm Show in Butler City.\n\nHere’s a minute-by-minute breakdown of what happened:\n\n**6:02 PM – **Trump takes the stage at a campaign rally at Butler Farms in Pennsylvania to the sound of “God bless the USA”. He waves at the cheering crowd.\n\n**6:11 PM – **A few minutes into his speech, while talking about a spike in immigration of undocumented people under President Joe Biden, Trump points to a chart that shows illegal border crossings. “Take a look at what happened…” he says.\n\nThen, a short burst of gunfire is heard in quick succession. Trump grabs his right ear while more shots are heard.\n\nSecret Service agents rush to the stage, yelling, “Get down!” as even more shots are fired. The agents surround Trump and keep him pinned to the ground as blood runs from his ear.\n\nScreams from the crowd are heard as most people are looking for cover. Some are still in their seats and are looking at the stage. Security forces move onto the scene.\n\nThe shooting ends in less than a minute. One person from the crowd is dead. He was sitting behind Trump in the stands. Two more people are critically injured.\n\nThe snipers on Trump’s detail kill the suspected attacker.\n\n**6:12 PM – **“Are you ready? Move!” the Secret Service agents say but stay in their positions, keeping Trump under the podium. Armed soldiers rush the stage. The Secret Service helps Trump get up while covering him. Trump is heard saying: “Let me get my shoes.”\n\nAs they prepare to exit the stage, Trump raises his fist in the air, and the crowd responds with cheers.\n\nTrump is ushered off the stage while the crowd chants “USA.” He says “Fight!” repeatedly as he is taken offstage.\n\nThe Secret Service ushers Trump into an SUV. He raises his fist one last time, then gets in, and the car pulls away.\n\nTrump is taken to the nearest hospital, the Butler Memorial Hospital, about 17km (11 miles) from the site of the shooting.\n\nTrump is later released and his motorcade transports him to Pittsburgh International Airport.\n\n**6:42 PM – **The Secret Service issues a statement that says the former president is safe after “an incident” took place at the rally. The Trump campaign confirms that Trump “is fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility”.\n\n**8:13 PM – **Joe Biden condemns the attack during his televised speech and says he was relieved that Trump is reportedly “doing well.”\n\n“We cannot allow this to be happening,” Biden said. “The idea that there’s violence in America like this is just unheard of.”\n\nUpdated FBI statement on the ongoing incident that took place yesterday in Butler, Pennsylvania. https://t.co/yqwxGmKOjw pic.twitter.com/pk2Rw55Lga\n\n— FBI (@FBI) July 14, 2024\n\n\n**8:42 PM –** Trump posts on Truth Social about the incident. “I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear,” Trump wrote. “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin.”\n\n**12:00 AM – **Shortly after midnight, the plane that carries Donald Trump lands at Newark Liberty International Airport.\n\n**1:34 AM –** The FBI formally called the attack on Trump an “assassination attempt” and said a motive hasn’t been found yet.",

        "content": "Donald Trump escaped an assassination attempt on Saturday, July 13, at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a town north of Pittsburgh. The former president was not seriously harmed, while the gunman was shot dead by security services. One bystander also died, and two others are in critical condition. According to the *New York Times*, an AR-15 assault rifle was recovered. The FBI early on Sunday identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump had begun his speech shortly after 6 pm in front of his supporters under intense sunshine. It was his last rally before the start of the Republican convention, which kicks off on July 15 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Suddenly, a loud bang was heard. A short blast. The former president put his hand to his right ear. Two more similar bangs sounded, and Trump went to the ground, immediately surrounded by several Secret Service agents charged with his protection. In the stands behind the podium, participants also crouched down to protect themselves, not understanding what was happening. The ex-president remained on the ground for about a minute, with three Secret Service agents surrounding him. \"Shooter's down, let's move,\" one of them finally called out.\n\n**You have 85.41% of this article left to read.

        "content": "The FBI has identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. Authorities say he fired multiple shots from a building rooftop just outside the rally venue before he was killed by Secret Service agents.\n\nTwo injured shooting victims at Trump rally identified\n\nFrom CNN's Andy Rose\n\nTwo people who were shot during Saturday’s Donald Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and who are now stable were identified Sunday by state police.\n\nPennsylvania State Police identified David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and 74-year-old James Copenhaver from Moon Township, Pennsylvania, in a Sunday press release.\n\nThe state police also confirmed the name of Corey Comperatore, 50, as the victim who was killed in the assassination attempt. His identity was announced earlier in the day by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.\n\nThe Marine Corps League of Pennsylvania, Inc., identified Dutch as a commandant in its organization in Westmoreland County. MCL Vice Commandant Matt Popovich said on Facebook that Dutch underwent two surgeries after being “shot in the liver and chest.”\n\n“These victims and their families are certainly in our thoughts today,” said Col. Christopher Paris, the state police commissioner. “The Pennsylvania State Police continue to work tirelessly alongside our federal, state and local partners as this investigation continues.”\n\nCNN’s Sara Smart contributed to this report.\n\nLink Copied!\n\nDiscussions underway about adding more federal law enforcement agents in Milwaukee for RNC\n\nFrom CNN's Whitney Wild\n\nA law enforcement source familiar with planning for the Republican Nation Convention told CNN on Sunday there are discussions underway about adding more federal law enforcement agents to post positions in light of the recent shooting.\n\nHowever, the perimeter is unlikely to change, the source said, noting preparations for the RNC have been underway for a year and a half.\n\nThe source added that there have been discussions about adding additional security for high-profile GOP members as well.\n\nThe source said events, such as dinners, may be hard to police as they are outside the perimeter associated with the RNC and do not have the same level of security.\n\nThe source noted this concern had also been discussed before Saturday’s shooting.\n\nLink Copied!\n\nMother and son at Trump rally describe \"complete shock\" following assassination attempt\n\nFrom CNN’s Sara Smart\n\nAttendees duck for safety at former President Donald Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13.\n\nDonna Hutz\n\nA mother and son who witnessed the shooting at former President Donald Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday said the incident was “too close for comfort,” as they were just a few rows in front of the attendees who were shot.\n\nDonna Hutz and her son Joe traveled from Hubbard, Ohio, and arrived at 8:30 a.m. Saturday for the rally. They were seated in the third row on the bleachers behind the former president. Donna told CNN on Sunday they almost made the decision to sit higher up in the bleachers and they’re glad they didn’t.\n\nWhen the incident unfolded, both immediately got down and ducked for safety. Joe, 25, said when he realized what was going on he yelled, “Gun, get down!” so others would understand the severity of the situation.\n\nAttendees duck for safety at former President Donald Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13.\n\nDonna Hutz\n\nThe attendees who were shot during the incident were about six rows above the pair, they said.\n\nSeeing Trump stand up and put his fist in the air after the shooting made Donna and Joe feel empowered.\n\n“Knowing that he is the only one who can help our country, I was happy to see him get up and that he was powerful,” Donna added.\n\nJoe said he’d attend another event soon. “They can’t scare us,” he said.\n\nLink Copied!\n\nShooter was a dietary aid at a nursing and rehabilitation center, facility confirms\n\nFrom CNN’s Yahya Abou-Ghazala\n\nMarcie Grimm, the administrator of Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, confirmed to CNN that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the man identified as the shooter at the Donald Trump rally, was a dietary aide at the facility.\n\nGrimm added that the facility is cooperating with law enforcement and that “Our thoughts and prayers go out to Former President Trump and the victims impacted by this terrible tragedy.”\n\nLink Copied!\n\nDemocratic congressman says staffer who posted inflammatory post about Trump shooting \"no longer\" employed\n\nFrom CNN’s Annie Grayer\n\nDemocratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi said Sunday that a staffer who made an inflammatory post about the assassination attempt of Donald Trump is “no longer in (his) employment.”\n\nA post on Facebook associated with the staffer’s account suggested the gunman needed shooting lessons “so you don’t miss next time.”\n\nTrump said he was shot in the ear during the shooting Saturday night.\n\nThe Clarion Ledger reported Sunday the post has since been deleted.\n\nCNN has reached out to the staffer for comment.\n\nLink Copied!\n\nWashington Post: Local police officer saw gunman before shooting but couldn't engage, sheriff says\n\nFrom CNN’s Allison Gordon\n\nA local police officer saw the gunman just before he fired on a Donald Trump rally Saturday but was unable to engage him, Butler County Sheriff Michael T. Slupe said in an interview Sunday with The Washington Post.\n\nSlupe told The Post that the officer was examining the area after there were requests from law enforcement to identify a suspicious person.\n\n“So police responded to try to find the guy, searched the area, but couldn’t find him, so said, ‘Well, let’s try the roof,’” Slupe said.\n\nSlupe said the officer pulled himself up enough to look on the roof and see the gunman, who also saw the officer and pointed his gun at the officer.\n\n“He lets go because he doesn’t want to get killed,” Slupe said. The gunman then started firing.\n\nCNN reported earlier that the shooter was spotted outside the event by local law enforcement, who thought he might’ve been acting suspiciously near the walk-through metal detectors, according to a senior law enforcement official. They put out a call over the radio to keep an eye on him, and that information was passed on to Secret Service, the source said.\n\nLink Copied!\n\nSome Trump supporters blame the media for assassination attempt\n\nFrom CNN's Oliver Darcy\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is helped off the stage during the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13.\n\nGene J. Puskar/AP\n\nMoments after Donald Trump was rushed to safety following a failed assassination attempt at a Saturday rally, some of his supporters turned toward the press pen with obscenities as they fingered reporters for blame.\n\n“It is your fault!” exclaimed another.\n\nAxios reporter Sophia Cai, who quoted some in the crowd warning the press, “you’re next” and that their “time is coming,” even reported that a few rallygoers tried to breach the barriers establishing the press pen, but that they were stopped by security personnel.\n\nIn the immediate wake of the horrific shooting, the news media has quickly emerged among some Trump supporters as a body to assign blame.\n\nWhile the Trump campaign urged its staff to “condemn all forms of violence” and said it “will not tolerate dangerous rhetoric on social media,” some of the former president’s supporters in MAGA media vehemently assailed the press for its hard-knuckled reporting on Trump, which has sounded the alarm on what four more years under the former president would look like.\n\nOver the course of the campaign cycle, news organizations have, among other things, reported at length on Trump’s plans to warp the federal government for his own ends, including to seek vengeance against his political opponents.

        "content": "BUTLER, Pa. — Former president Donald Trump was rushed offstage with blood dripping down his face Saturday after a shooting that the authorities called an assassination attempt. One attendee was killed, and two others were critically injured at the campaign rally, the Secret Service said, a shocking turn in a tense election season in which concerns about violence had already been running high.\n\nThe FBI identified the suspected shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pa. Officials did not provide any information about a motive.\n\nDuring the rally, “a suspected shooter fired multiple shots toward the stage from an elevated position outside of the rally venue,” according to Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. The suspected shooter is dead, said Guglielmi, who confirmed the other death and injuries.\n\nTrump, in a social media post Saturday night, said he was shot in his upper right ear and offered his thanks to law enforcement. He also extended his condolences to the families of other victims. A campaign spokesman said the former president was taken to a medical facility but is “fine.”\n\n“It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nThe scene unfolded just days before he is set to formally receive the GOP nomination for president at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee — and renewed fears about rising threats of political violence.\n\nAt a news conference just before midnight, FBI special agent Kevin Rojek said investigators consider the shooting an “assassination attempt against our former president Donald Trump.”\n\nAuthorities said there would be a lengthy investigation into how the suspect was able to carry out such an attack. Pressed on how the shooter was able to fire multiple times at the venue, Rojek acknowledged: “It is surprising.”\n\n## Podcast episode\n\nThe alleged shooter used an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle to carry out the attack, a U.S. official said, also speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the early stages of the investigation.\n\nButler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger said the shooter was on the roof of an office building outside the security perimeter for the event.\n\nAuthorities said it was too early to say whether the shooter was acting alone and that they were not ready to release the names of victims, though they said the person killed and the others critically injured were all male adults.\n\nMinutes into his remarks, Trump reached for his right ear and then crouched behind the lectern after the first of several pops, which sent the crowd into a panic. A voice was heard saying, “Get down, get down, get down!” Several more apparent shots followed a couple of seconds later. Audience members screamed, and smoke rose in the air.\n\nMembers of Trump’s Secret Service detail rushed in, one yelling, “Hawkeye is here!” as members of the Secret Service’s counterassault team mounted the stage, wearing black tactical gear and pointing rifles at the crowd — trying to give the former president and his detail cover so that agents could rush him to safety.\n\nThe crowd roared as Trump and the officers began to maneuver offstage. The former president pumped his fist while walking off with what appeared to be blood dripping down his right ear and streaked across his cheek. A Washington Post photographer observed what appeared to be blood on the riser behind the former president.\n\nTrump’s campaign issued a statement condemning the incident. “President Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for their quick action during this heinous act. He is fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility,” campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in the statement. Later in the evening, Trump campaign advisers and Republican Party officials said in a joint statement that Trump looked forward to proceeding with the convention.\n\nAt a news conference Saturday evening, President Biden — who was at a church in Delaware during the incident — said he had been briefed and had tried to contact Trump, who he understood to be doing well. “Look, there’s no place in America for this kind of violence. It’s sick,” Biden said. “It’s sick. It’s one of the reasons why we have to unite this country.” Late in the evening, a White House official said Biden and Trump had spoken.\n\nBiden campaign officials said Saturday night that they were working to pull down their television ads as quickly as they could.\n\nGoldinger, the district attorney, said the shooter was on the roof of a nearby office belonging to American Glass Research. William Bellis, chief financial officer at AGR International — which calls American Glass Research a subsidiary and is based in a cluster of buildings closest to the Trump rally — said Saturday night that the company worked with local police beforehand on security concerns. Police blocked off public access to the company’s parking lot, and that space was available for law enforcement use, Bellis said.\n\nRico Elmore, a former Republican candidate for the Pennsylvania House who spoke ahead of Trump, was feet from the stage when shots rang out. At first, he said it sounded like firecrackers. Elmore, an Air Force guardsman, yelled for people to get down and heard some call for a medic.\n\nAbout 10 feet from him, to the right of Trump, a man in the audience was bleeding from his head, Elmore said. Before the medical responders could reach the man, Elmore jumped over a barrier and tried to hold the head wound, the blood smearing across Elmore’s white shirt.\n\n“I held his head and keep it in tact but it was just, it was a serious injury,” Elmore said. He didn’t believe the man survived. He said he also saw a woman passed out, but she didn’t appear to be bloodied.\n\n“There was a lot of anger, a lot of fear, a lot of crying. There were a couple people praying,” said Cindy Hildebrand, the chairwoman of the United Republicans of Butler County, who was also at the rally. A woman next to her had a 7-year-old daughter who was up front hanging from a post excited to see Trump. “Now we have a 7-year-old somewhere out there that is just absolutely traumatized.”\n\nAs Republicans raised alarms about the vitriol of some opposition to Trump, Hildebrand said her organization received a phone call after the shooting from a woman who said, “He gets what he deserves.”\n\nThe crowd evacuated in an orderly manner, some directing anger over what happened at the media. Police told people to leave because the site was an active crime scene.\n\nDave McCormick, the Republican candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania — who was in the front row — said during an interview on Fox News that he saw a lot of blood and that Trump is “very lucky to be alive.”\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement that he had been briefed on the shooting and briefed the president. The FBI, ATF, U.S. attorney’s office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, and the Justice Department’s national security division are working with the Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies, Garland said, adding that “violence like this is an attack on our democracy.”\n\nPennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said that he was also briefed on the situation and that state police were at the site. “Violence targeted at any political party or political leader is absolutely unacceptable,” Shapiro said in a statement. “It has no place in Pennsylvania or the United States.”\n\nNational and world leaders across the political spectrum quickly weighed in with horror at what unfolded and offered well wishes for Trump.\n\n“There is absolutely no place for political violence in our democracy,” former president Barack Obama said in a statement.\n\n“Political violence has no place in our country,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) echoed.\n\nRepublicans shared images of Trump fist-pumping toward the crowd.\n\n“God protected President Trump,” wrote Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a vice-presidential contender, in a posting with the picture. Another possible running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), also shared the photo.\n\nAs information about the violence was just beginning to emerge — with authorities saying little about the details of the incident — some Republicans suggested rhetoric from Democrats was to blame. Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.) went further: “Joe Biden sent the orders,” he wrote on X.\n\nThere is no evidence that Biden was behind the attack.\n\nSen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), a potential Trump running mate, said in a statement on social media that the shooting was “not just some isolated incident.”\n\n“The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,” Vance wrote. “That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.”\n\nRepublicans preparing for the convention in Milwaukee gathered around televisions in a hotel lobby after the incident. Charlie Gerow, a Pennsylvania-based GOP strategist, was in the hotel and described an emotional scene with people crossing themselves and looking stunned.\n\nThe convention is expected to continue but with additional security, according to an official familiar with the preparations who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n\nAt a moment when threats against elected officials have escalated, presidential historian Tim Naftali said the tone that Trump and other leaders take in the coming days will have an enormous bearing on what happens next.\n\nDescribing the country as a “pressure cooker,” Naftali said: “We’ve been turning up the gas — and some kind of political violence seemed increasingly likely.”\n\n“As a country we have been dancing around Pandora’s box,” said Naftali, who teaches presidential studies at Columbia University’s School of International Public Affairs, “and a horrible person today may have opened it.”\n\n*Josh Dawsey, Colby Itkowitz, Maeve Reston, Matt Viser, Joyce Lee, Carol D.

I will not utter this depraved individual’s name. He should be starved of the glory he so desperately wants,” Noem said in the statement.\n\nShe went on to suggest that Democrats who have reminded active-duty troops that they can refuse illegal orders have somehow vilified those service members.\n\n“Those politicians and media who continue to vilify our men and women in uniform need to take a long hard look in the mirror,” Noem said.\n\nThe department of homeland security confirmed the suspect’s name and said that he was admitted to the US by the Biden administration “as part of their Operation Allies Welcome program on September 8, 2021.”\n\nIgnoring the vetting efforts that went in to those admissions, the department claimed that the program “let in thousands of unvetted Afghan nationals including terrorists into our country.”\n\nThis concludes our live coverage of the second Trump administration for the day.

A federal court judge ruled last week that all of the guard troops should be withdrawn from Washington DC, since the deployment is probably illegal.\n\nSenior justice department official suggests Democrats who warned about illegal orders are to blame for attack on national guard troops\n\nSince the shooting of two national guard troops in Washington DC on Wednesday afternoon, elected officials of both major parties have expressed their horror at the shootings.\n\nOne of them was Mark Kelly, the Arizona senator and retired Navy fighter pilot and astronaut who recently reminded active-duty troops that they have the right to disobey unlawful orders.\n\n“This is horrific,” Kelly wrote on X on Wednesday. “I’m thinking of the families of these two National Guard members who lost their lives while serving the day before Thanksgiving. Thank you to the first responders who’ve brought a suspect into custody.”\n\nAmong the replies to Kelly’s post was one from Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative lawyer now serving as assistant attorney general for civil rights. “Look in the mirror,” Dhillon wrote to Kelly, suggesting that the video he recorded, with five other Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds, had somehow inspired this attack on uniformed troops patrolling Washington DC.\n\nTrump calls shooting of national guard troops 'an act of terror' carried out by an Afghan 'flown in by the Biden administration'\n\nSpeaking from Palm Beach, Florida, Donald Trump called the shooting of two members of the West Virginia national guard outside a metro station near the White House “an act of terror”.\n\n“I can report tonight that based on the best available information, the Department of Homeland Security is confident that the suspect in custody is a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan, a hellhole on Earth,” the president said in a brief video address. “He was flown in by the Biden administration in September 2021, on those infamous flights that everybody was talking about.”\n\n“Nobody knew who was coming in, nobody knew anything about it” Trump charged, ignoring the vetting effort carried out by US military, intelligence and immigration agents.\n\nTrump also made no mention of the fact that he had struck the agreement with the Taliban in 2020 to remove all US troops from Afghanistan in 2021.\n\n“His status was extended under legislation signed by President Biden, a disastrous president, the worst in the history of our country,” Trump continued.\n\nThe president then used the attack to once again share his false claim that the previous administration “let in 20 million unknown and unvetted foreigners from all over the world, from places that you don’t want to even know about.”\n\nTrump went on to claim that the attack justified his program of mass deportation and his aggressive disdain for refugees from other nations bombed by the US military in recent decades.\n\n“No country can tolerate such a risk to our very survival,” Trump said. “An example is Minnesota, where hundreds of thousands of Somalians are ripping off our country, and ripping apart that once great state.” Trump appeared to be referring to the hyperventilation in the rightwing media over accusations of fraud against a small number of Somali-Americans in Minnesota.\n\nHe then returned to a familiar target of attack, his claim that a Somali- American refugee who represents Minnesota in Congress, Ilhan Omar, “preach to us about our constitution and how our country is no good.”\n\nThe president finished by claiming that this single attack justified a project his administration was already preparing to carry out: the reconsideration of refugee and asylum status granted under previous admninistrations.\n\n“We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country,” the president said. “If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them.”\n\nMultiple news outlets are reporting that the suspect in the shooting attack on two uniformed national guard troops in Washington DC on Wednesday, who has been identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is a 29-year-old Afghan national who entered the United States in 2021 as part of Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era program to support Afghans put at risk by the US withdrawal from Afghanistan that year.\n\nAn archived web page of the Department of Homeland Security site described the aim of the program as providing support for “vulnerable Afghans, including those who worked alongside us in Afghanistan for the past two decades, as they safely resettle in the United States.”\n\nAn FAQ on the site includes this description of how Afghan nationals arriving in the US under the program were vetted to ensure that they did not pose security risks:\n\nThe screening and vetting process involves biometric and biographic screenings conducted by intelligence, law enforcement, and counterterrorism professionals from the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), and additional intelligence community partners prior to their arrival in the United States. If someone fails these checks while they are still overseas, they will not be permitted to board a flight to the United States.\n\nVideo shows emergency response after shooting of national guard troops near White House\n\nVideo recorded by a witness in the aftermath of the shooting near the White House on Wednesday showed the gunshot victims being treated on a sidewalk outside the Farragut West metro station.\n\nSome of that witness video was obtained by the Guardian and is included in this report, along with preliminary statements on the investigation from Jeffery Carroll, assistant chief of Washington DC’s Metropolitan police department, and Muriel Bowser, the city’s mayor.\n\nSuspect in shooting of guard members identified as Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal\n\nThe suspected gunman in the shooting of two national guard members on Wednesday near the White House has been identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who entered the United States in September 2021 and has been living in Washington state, law enforcement officials told the Associated Press and other outlets.\n\nAfter golf, Trump comments on new polling and election in Honduras\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the shooting of two national guard troops who were in Washington DC because Donald Trump wanted them there, the president posted once about the shooting on his social media platform and then moved on to other topics.\n\nThe attack took place while Trump was at his golf club in West Palm Beach and, according to the White House, the president was briefed on the shooting before he returned to his club, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nShortly after he arrived back at Mar-a-Lago, Trump posted about the shooting and referred to the attacker as an “animal”.\n\nThe post about his approval rating, from a survey conducted by his pollster, John McLaughlin, which is nearly nine points higher than Trump’s average in national polls, was illustrated by a giant photo of Trump’s smiling face.\n\nLaw enforcement officials tell NBC News suspected gunman who shot uniformed troops is an Afghan national\n\nNBC News reports that unnamed law enforcement officials tell the outlet that the suspected gunman, who is alleged to have shot two uniformed members of the national guard near the White House on Wednesday, “has been initially identified as an Afghan national.”\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting of the two guard members, who were both shot in the head, as a possible act of terrorism, officials briefed on the investigation told NBC.\n\nJD Vance asked troops to pray for wounded guard members, then joked about turkey\n\nIn remarks earlier on Wednesday at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, JD Vance, the vice-president, asked troops to pray for the two wounded members of the West Virginia national guard who were shot on Wednesday in Washington DC.\n\nLater in his prepared remarks, Vance joked about the fact that Americans eat turkey on Thanksgiving.\n\n“Turkey, think about turkey,” Vance said. “Who really likes, be honest with yourself, who really likes turkey?”\n\nAfter a small number of soldiers raised their hands and cheered, Vance told them: “You’re all full of shit. Everybody who raised your hands.”\n\nAs the audience laughed, the current frontrunner to be the Republican nominee for president in 2028 added: “Here’s how I know that every single one of you who raised your hand is lying to me: how many times do you roast an 18-pound turkey, just randomly? Just, you know, a nice summer afternoon, we’re going to go get an 18-pound turkey.”\n\n“Nobody does it because turkey doesn’t actually taste that good,” Vance continued. “But on Thanksgiving… the most American holiday, we’re gonna cook a turkey, by God, because that’s what Americans do! We cook this gigantic American bird, and we do all kinds of crazy things to make it taste good.”\n\nFBI director sows confusion at news conference on shooting of national guard troops\n\nKash Patel, the FBI director, sowed confusion at a news conference when he seemed to stumble over his words while pledging to devote all necessary federal resources to the investigation of the shooting on Wednesday.\n\nWhen it was his turn to speak, what Patel actually said was: “We will shortchange the American public with no resources to make sure we find and safeguard our nation’s capital, right here in Washington DC, and bring anyone responsible for this heinous act of violence to justice.”\n\nShortly after Patel spoke, Jeffery Carroll, assistant chief of Washington DC’s Metropolitan Police Department, said that “at this time, there is no indication that there was any other suspect. The one suspect that was involved in this incident, they were shot during the interaction and transported to the hospital for treatment.”\n\nPatel was then asked by a reporter to clarify why he had pledged to bring “anyone responsible” for the shooting to justice. Patel let Carroll answer the question. The police chief clarified that there was no active search for any other suspects, since video of the shooting reviewed by the police suggested that it appeared to have been the work of “a lone gunman”.",

        "content": "The Afghan man alleged to have shot two National Guardsmen near the White House had his asylum approved by the Trump administration earlier this year, according to reports.\n\nThe suspect has been identified by multiple law enforcement sources and media outlets as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal. According to CNN, fingerprints matched a man of that name who fled to the U.S. during the Taliban takeover of his homeland in 2021.\n\nLakanwal, the outlet reported, had “applied for asylum in 2024, and it was granted by the Trump administration in April 2025.”\n\nABC News also identified the suspect as Lakanwal, reporting three law enforcement sources who said his asylum was approved in April 2025.\n\nWhile not naming Lakanwal, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed on X that the suspect had arrived “under Operation Allies Welcome on September 8, 2021.”\n\nThe shooting unfolded by the Farragut West Metro entrance around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday. Officials said the West Virginia Guardsmen—a woman and a man on “high-visibility patrols” in the capital—were initially fired upon before subduing the gunman, who was also hospitalized.\n\nBoth Guardsmen remain in critical condition, and the suspect is in custody after being wounded following the incident. Authorities have not publicly released the Guardsmen’s identities.\n\nOfficials have not announced a motive. The FBI is probing whether the attack could have international terror links, ABC reported.\n\nFollowing the shooting, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it was halting, “effective immediately,” the processing of immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals pending a security review.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, 79, delivered a late-night address from Florida calling the ambush “an act of terror,” vowing to “re-examine every single alien” who entered from Afghanistan and to send 500 more Guard troops to Washington.\n\n“He was flown in by the Biden administration in September 2021, on those infamous flights that everybody was talking about,” Trump said.\n\n“Nobody knew who was coming in. Nobody knew anything about it. His status was extended under legislation signed by President Biden, a disastrous President, the worst in the history of our country.”\n\nHe added, “If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them. “America will never bend and never yield in the face of terror. And at the same time, we will not be deterred from the mission the service members were so nobly fulfilling.”\n\nTrump announced that his “Department of War” would send 500 more troops to Washington.\n\nNoem also blamed the Biden-era program: “The suspect who shot our brave National Guardsmen is an Afghan national who was one of the many unvetted, mass paroled into the United States...under the Biden Administration,” she wrote on X, in a post which drew immediate pushback from critics who pointed out that the asylum approval had occurred this year.\n\nDeclining to name Lakanwal, she added, “I will not utter this depraved individual’s name. He should be starved of the glory he so desperately wants.”\n\nBefore moving to America, Lakanwal had served alongside U.S. Special Forces troops in Afghanistan, NBC reported, per a close relative and CIA Director John Ratcliffe.\n\nIntelligence sources told Fox News Digital that Lakanwal had worked “with various entities in the U.S. government, including the CIA, due to his work as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.”\n\nRatcliffe told the outlet: “In the wake of the disastrous Biden withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Biden administration justified bringing the alleged shooter to the United States in September 2021 due to his prior work with the U.S. government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar, which ended shortly following the chaotic evacuation.”\n\nA White House official said that, as President, Joe Biden entered into the 2023 Ahmed Court Settlement, meaning that, regardless of his asylum status, Lakanwal would not have been removed due to his parole status.\n\nThey added that the Democrats had “sued the Trump administration relentlessly and blocked us in court repeatedly every time we have tried to revoke parole status.”\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told the Daily Beast: “This animal would’ve never been here if not for Joe Biden’s dangerous policies, which allowed countless unvetted criminals to invade our country and harm the American people.”",

        "content": "With an assassination attempt on Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, 2024, the U.S. experienced another violent episode in its increasingly polarized politics.\n\nFormer President Trump, who’s about to formally become the GOP nominee for president in the 2024 election, survived the attempted assassination when, initial reports said, a bullet grazed his ear. But one rally attendee was killed, more spectators were injured and the suspected gunman is also dead.\n\nThe Conversation’s politics editor, Naomi Schalit, spoke with University of Massachusetts scholar Arie Perliger after the event. Perliger offered insight from his study of political violence and assassinations. Given the stark political polarization in the U.S., Perliger said, “it’s not a surprise that eventually people engage in violence.”\n\n**Schalit: When you heard the news, what was the first thing you thought?**\n\n**Perliger**: The first thing that I thought about is that we were basically one inch from a potential civil war. I think that if, indeed, Donald Trump would have suffered fatal injuries today, the level of violence that we witnessed so far will be nothing in comparison to what would have happened in the next couple of months. I think that would have unleashed a new level of anger, frustration, resentment, hostility that we haven’t seen for many, many years in the U.S.\n\nThis assassination attempt, at least at this early stage, may validate a strong sense among many Trump supporters and many people on the far right that they are being delegitimized, that they are on the defensive and that there are efforts to basically prevent them from competing in the political process and prevent Trump from returning to the White House.\n\nWhat we’ve just seen, for many of the people on the far right, fits very well into a narrative that they’ve already been constructing and disseminating for the last few months.\n\n**Political assassination attempts don’t aim only to kill someone. They have a larger goal, don’t they?**\n\nIn many ways, assassination attempts bypass the long process of trying to downgrade and defeat political opponents, when there is a sense that even a long political struggle will not be sufficient. Many perpetrators see assassinations as a tool that will allow them to achieve their political objectives in a very quick, very effective way that doesn’t demand a lot of resources or a lot of organization. If we are trying to connect it to what we’ve seen today, I think that many people see Trump as a unicorn, as a unique entity, who in many ways really consumed the entire conservative movement. So by removing him, there’s a sense that that will or may solve the problem.\n\nI think that the conservative movement changed dramatically since 2016, when Trump was first elected, and a lot of the characteristics of Trumpism are actually now fairly popular in different parts of the conservative movement. So even if Trump will decide to retire at some point, I don’t think that Trumpism – as a set of populist ideas – will disappear from the GOP. But I can definitely understand why people who see that as a threat will feel that removing Trump can solve all the problems.\n\n**In a study of the causes and impacts of political assassination, you wrote that unless electoral processes can address “the most intense political grievances … electoral competition has the potential to instigate further violence, including the assassinations of political figures.” Is that what you saw in this attempted assassination?**\n\nDemocracy cannot work if the different parties, the different movements, are not willing to work together on some issues. Democracy works when multiple groups are willing to reach some kind of consensus through negotiations, to collaborate and to cooperate.\n\nWhat we’ve seen in the last 17 years, basically since 2008 and the rise of the Tea Party movement, is that there’s increasing polarization in the U.S. And the worst part of this polarization is that the American political system became dysfunctional in the sense that we are forcing out any politicians and policymakers who are interested in collaboration with the other side. That’s one thing. Second, people delegitimize leaders who are willing to collaborate with the other side, hence, presenting them as individuals who betrayed their values and political party.\n\nThe third part is that people are delegitimizing their political rivals. They transform a political disagreement into a war in which there is no space for working together to address the challenges they agree are facing the nation.\n\nWhen you combine those three dynamics, you create basically a dysfunctional system where both sides are convinced that it’s a zero-sum game, that it’s the end of the country. It’s the end of democracy if the other side wins.\n\nIf both sides are hammering into people again and again that losing an election is the end of the world, then it’s not a surprise that eventually people are willing to take the law into their hands and to engage in violence.\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\n*This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

        "content": "It took only a few hours for President Donald Trump to turn what he called “an act of evil, and an act of terror” into a full-blown argument for an even more intense crackdown on immigration.\n\nHis vow came as authorities held a man Trump described as an Afghan national over the shooting of two West Virginia National Guard reservists in Washington, DC. They were in the capital as part of Trump’s controversial deployment of troops to bolster law enforcement.\n\n“America will never bend and never yield in the face of terror, and at the same time, we will not be deterred from the mission these service members were so nobly fulfilling,” Trump said.\n\nThe president, speaking on video from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, pivoted quickly from paying tribute to the victims of the tragedy to blaming the Biden administration for bringing the alleged shooter to the United States after the withdrawal of American troops in 2021. He claimed the incident “underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation.”\n\nBut he also used the moment to drive home his campaign against other migrants in politically charged remarks that went far beyond Afghanistan — at a moment when his administration is moving to reinterview some refugees admitted under President Joe Biden and revoking temporary protected status for those from several dangerous world hot spots.\n\nTrump lashed out at Somali immigrants in Minnesota, despite there being no apparent connection with the DC shooting. He claimed they were “ripping off our country and ripping apart that once-great state.” Trump described Somalia as a country that has “no laws, no water, no military, no nothing.”\n\nThe full details of the incident in Washington are not yet known. But Trump’s comments were characteristic of a president who rarely waits for full clarity before engaging politically.\n\nBut there will certainly be urgent questions about the vetting of Afghan immigrants — many of whom came to the US during the Biden administration after helping American forces during the country’s longest war. While the exact circumstances of Wednesday’s incident are not fully known, the FBI has long warned about the danger of self-radicalized individuals from immigrant communities becoming inspired by groups such as ISIS or online propaganda and carrying out attacks on the US homeland.\n\nScrutiny may also fall on any follow-up immigration proceedings for the suspect that stretched into Trump’s second term. Then there’s the question of whether there were intelligence failures by Trump’s team ahead of Wednesday’s attack, at a time when government agencies are accused by critics of diverting resources from national security to immigration enforcement.\n\nPolitically, Trump seemed to be keen to define the debate that is sure to unfold over the shootings.\n\nHe vowed to “reexamine every single alien” who came to the US from Afghanistan, in remarks that will likely create fear among law-abiding immigrants — many of whom helped the US military and diplomats at considerable risk to themselves and their families during America’s longest war.\n\nThe president’s senior White House adviser Stephen Miller said on Fox News after the attack that Trump had made a “historic announcement, a brave announcement.”\n\n“What you heard tonight from President Trump, the breaking news here tonight, is saying that his government is going to accelerate efforts to review every person added this country over the last four years,” Miller said.\n\n“Now obviously, if you are illegal you are out automatically,” Miller continued. “But everybody else who was brought here, refugee, asylum status, whatever status … if you’re not someone who loves this country, if you’re not any benefit to this country, then we’re going to send you out of this country.”\n\nTrump’s extremely political remarks may also have been designed to shut down any suggestions that the National Guard soldiers patrolling Washington in their fatigues have been left vulnerable by an ill-defined mission.\n\nA political storm has raged around the National Guard since Trump ordered it into some US cities. Now, debate will sharpen over the guard’s role and the administration’s attempts to militarize law enforcement in what officials described as a “targeted shooting” on the eve of Thanksgiving.\n\nThe shootings in Washington, DC, were the latest shocking outburst of public violence in a wrenching year that saw the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and killing of a state lawmaker and her husband in Minnesota.\n\nWednesday’s tragedy took on extra poignancy as Americans gathered with their families ahead of the national holiday, and cut deep for the people of West Virginia, which is among several states to send volunteer reservists to DC.\n\nFor National Guard troops on the streets of the capital Wednesday night, the shootings raised immediate and traumatic questions over their safety and protection, as their comrades lay in critical condition in the hospital. National Guard troops sent to Washington have been notable for their good humor and professionalism. But suddenly the possible danger that comes with their mission has come into sharp focus.\n\nMore broadly, and once the motive of the assailant has been established, there will be scrutiny about the unusual nature of the mission that the troops are being asked to undertake, in peacetime, on domestic soil. In their military fatigues, National Guard troops are highly visible — as seems to be Trump’s intent for deterrence purposes — but that can also leave them exposed.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has identified the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal. Officials briefed on the investigation said that they believe the shooter’s initial identification matches a man from Washington state who appears to have immigrated to the US from Afghanistan in August 2021. That theory will raise counter-terrorism concerns over whether the alleged shooter had a motivation to target US soldiers directly and whether other attacks are possible. US forces left Afghanistan for the last time in a chaotic withdrawal in August 2021.\n\nThe administration responded swiftly to the horror by doubling down on the deployment. Trump asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to mobilize 500 additional National Guard service members to the capital. The administration had also filed an emergency court order seeking to keep guard troops in the city after a federal judge last week ordered their removal, pending appeal.\n\n## Trump’s use of the guard is highly controversial\n\nThe National Guard’s initial deployment to Washington was hugely controversial and is part of a wider strategy that has seen reservists sent to other cities, including Los Angeles. Trump, who cultivates a strongman image, has long appeared keen to deploy troops on domestic soil, despite laws limiting their use in law enforcement missions. He called the guard to Washington in August while placing the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control and mobilizing officers from other agencies, arguing the city was a “filthy and crime ridden embarrassment” despite official data showing that crime was falling.\n\nBut critics warned that deploying troops was unnecessary and carried authoritarian overtones. Washington, DC, officials sued the administration, arguing that it had violated the city’s limited home rule and the authority of Congress, while flouting laws that prohibit the use of the military in domestic law enforcement in all but the most extreme circumstances. “The deployment also risks inflaming tensions and fueling distrust toward local law enforcement,” the lawsuit said.\n\nThat debate was already being revisited following Wednesday’s shooting, with a White House official forcefully rebutting criticism over the necessity of the guard’s presence in DC as an attempt to “politicize this tragedy.”\n\nPolice and the FBI were searching for a motive for the attack. City Mayor Muriel Bowser said that the guards were victims of a “targeted shooting.” With that in mind, the investigation will be important to establishing whether this was a politicized attack or whether the guard members were a target of opportunity — factors that are likely to shape how the politics of the incident’s aftermath develop.\n\nNeither possibility will lessen the heinous nature of the shooting or detract from the tragedy of two volunteer reservists being shot while serving their country.\n\nTrump has argued that his Washington, DC, crackdown is a huge success, and that people now feel safe in the capital. It’s unclear how the Thanksgiving shooting, which sent scores of people running from the scene, will influence perceptions of his strategy.\n\nCritics of Trump’s approach have long worried that, far from making DC safer, the presence of uniformed troops on the streets could cause more tensions and that the soldiers could themselves be vulnerable. After the initial shock of seeing khaki-clad troops on the streets and vehicles in military livery, many Washingtonians have come to see Guard members as a largely benign presence. They are often seen milling outside Metro stations and even picking up litter in “beautification” projects. They have typically not been in combat posture, even though some have been armed.\n\nBut federal District Judge Jia Cobb wrote last week, in an order ruling that the Guard was illegally deployed in Washington, that there was a “substantial risk” that their presence “is going to lead to a dangerous or deadly encounter that could be catastrophic for public safety.”\n\nCobb, however, delayed her order 21 days to allow the Trump administration to file an appeal.\n\nNow that troops have been the victims of an attack, Democrats are sure to question Trump’s decision-making.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Robert Garcia told CNN’s Jim Sciutto that the attack was “horrific” and said he was thinking about “the entire Guard family.” He added that he wasn’t sure Trump’s ask for 500 additional troops was “the right call” and that decisions about the security situations should be left to local officials.\n\nDemocratic Rep. James Walkinshaw of Virginia told CNN’s Erica Hill the shootings were “shocking and horrific.” He noted that many people in the DC region admired the professionalism of the guard and have had positive interactions with them.\n\n“Most of us in the Democratic side in Congress don’t think we should have National Guard men and women in our cities. But if that is going to happen, and when that is going to happen, I think it is incumbent on the administration to lay out a clear plan to ensure their protection,” said Walkinshaw, who just joined the House Homeland Security Committee.\n\nSince officials are calling the shooting “targeted,” there will be questions over whether Guard troops have the necessary force protection measures and training to deal with risks they face on the streets. “You’ve put National Guardsman in a bad position, now you have got them serving as law enforcement … that’s not what they were trained to do,” former Washington, DC, Police Chief Charles Ramsey told CNN.\n\n“You have got to really stop and think about what is it that are you trying to accomplish,” Ramsey said. “What is the mission?”\n\nNebraska Republican Rep. Don Bacon told CNN that in such an escalated political climate, everyone should react temperately to the horrific incident in Washington. “It is very incumbent on all of us, Democrats and Republicans, in the news, that we treat each other decently, we can disagree without being over the top, angry, throwing gas, lighting things on fire right now — our society, this hyper-partisanship that we have.”\n\nMost leading politicians were taking Bacon’s advice, issuing statements calling for prayers for the injured service members.\n\nBut a tragedy like this is sure to have political implications.\n\n*This story has been updated with additional reporting.*",

        "content": "Supported by\n\n# Shooting at Trump Rally Comes at Volatile Time in American History\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump was declared “fine” by his campaign, and the gunman was killed by Secret Service snipers. The explosion of political violence further inflamed the campaign for the White House.\n\n*Follow the latest news on the Trump assassination attempt**.*\n\nThe shots rang out at 6:10 p.m. Former President Donald J. Trump clutched his right ear as blood spurted out, then ducked for cover as supporters screamed and Secret Service agents raced to surround and protect him.\n\nWithin moments, someone shouted “shooter down” and the agents, agitated but in control, began moving Mr. Trump offstage to safety. “Wait, wait, wait, wait,” he called out, then made a point of pumping his fist at the crowd and seemed to defiantly shout, “Fight! Fight!” The crowd roared and responded with chants of “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!”\n\nFor the first time in more than four decades, a man who was elected president of the United States was wounded in an assassination attempt when a gunman who appeared to have crawled onto a nearby roof opened fire at Mr. Trump at a rally in Butler, Pa., on Saturday evening. The explosion of political violence came at an especially volatile moment in American history and further inflamed an already stormy campaign for the White House.\n\nAfter Secret Service snipers killed the shooter, the former president and putative Republican presidential nominee was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment and declared “fine” by his campaign. But a male spectator at the rally was killed and two other men were critically wounded, authorities said. The motivation for the attack remained under investigation.\n\n“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,” Mr. Trump wrote later on his social media site. “Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening.” Mr. Trump said he was “shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.”\n\nPresident Biden, who at the time of the shooting was at church in Rehoboth Beach, Del., where he has a vacation home, went before television cameras to condemn the shooting. “Look, there’s no place in America for this kind of violence,” Mr. Biden said. “It’s sick. It’s sick. It’s one of the reasons why we have to unite this country. We cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this.”\n\nHe later reached Mr. Trump by phone and left Delaware to fly back to the White House. By the end of the evening, Mr. Trump left the hospital and was taken to the Pittsburgh airport to fly back to his home in New Jersey.\n\nThe gunman was identified early Sunday by the F.B.I. as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, from Bethel Park, Pa., but officials released no additional information about him. A voter-registration record showed that Mr. Crooks was registered as a Republican, although federal campaign-finance records indicated that he donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a liberal voter turnout group, in January 2021.\n\nThe attack came just two days before the opening in Milwaukee of the Republican National Convention, which is set to nominate Mr. Trump for president for the third time, and his campaign confirmed that he still planned to be there. Even as Mr. Biden’s campaign said that it would suspend television advertising, supporters of Mr. Trump quickly blamed liberals, the news media and Mr. Biden for stoking animosity against the former president and said that it had led to the attack.\n\nWhile there were unsuccessful assassination attempts, incidents or plots targeting George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama during or after their terms, Mr. Trump was the first current or former president wounded in an act of violence since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981 by a would-be assassin trying to impress a Hollywood actress. Authorities have reported a surge of threats against elected and appointed officials of both parties in recent years, as anger has come to dominate the political discourse.\n\nMr. Trump has often been accused of fomenting violence, most notably on Jan. 6, 2021, when he encouraged a throng of supporters to march on the Capitol, where they ransacked the building in an attempt to stop Congress from ratifying Mr. Biden’s election victory. But there have been spasms of violence from the left as well, including the arrest of an armed man outside the house of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022 and the shooting of a Republican congressional leader during a baseball practice in 2017.\n\nThe national security division of the Justice Department planned to open an investigation into the attempt to shoot Mr. Trump, an indication that the department regarded the shooting not as an isolated act of violence but as an assassination attempt with national security implications.\n\nAnthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the Secret Service, said that the suspected shooter was on “an elevated position” outside the security perimeter, meaning that he was not screened by magnetometers as were those who attended the event. The gunman fired “multiple shots toward the stage,” Mr. Guglielmi said. Analysis of video and audio indicated that the gunman was roughly 400 feet north of the stage and eight shots were fired.\n\nLaw enforcement officials recovered an AR-15-type semiautomatic rifle from a deceased white male they believe was the gunman at the scene, according to two law enforcement officials. At a late-night news conference, officials declined to discuss a possible motivation pending further investigation.\n\n“At this time, we have no reason to believe there is any other existing threat out there,” Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police said, adding that it was “too early” to say whether it was a lone-wolf attack.\n\nThe rally was a typical Saturday night campaign event for Mr. Trump. It was hot in Butler, and the former president was starting about an hour late. Wearing a red Make America Great Again baseball cap with his suit but no tie, Mr. Trump was showing supporters a chart with numbers of border crossings just minutes into his speech when shots rang out in two bursts.\n\n“If you really want to see something that’s sad, take a look at what happened — ” he said and then abruptly stopped, as the hail of gunfire erupted.\n\nCorey Check, a local conservative activist and Republican committeeman in Butler, and his friend Nathan Rybner were sitting in a section of seats to the right of where Mr. Trump was standing when they heard a series of loud pops. The sounds seemed to be coming from over their heads in the section where they were sitting, they said.\n\n“I heard what I thought was firecrackers,” said Mr. Rybner, a Republican committeeman from Erie County, Pa. “It did not sound like a typical gunshot.”\n\nEduardo Vargas, 31, said he was sitting about 15 feet behind Mr. Trump and had heard the first shot. Mr. Vargas said that he did not know whether Mr. Trump had been shot. But minutes later, he said, he saw that Mr. Trump had blood on his forehead.\n\nThe Secret Service told everyone to “Get down! Get down!” Mr. Vargas said. “I saw half the people around me start crying,” he said. “And I started crying. I couldn’t stop crying.”\n\nMr. Vargas said he feared the worst. “I thought I just saw the president get killed in front of my face,” he said.\n\nTheresa Koshut, a teacher from Pittsburgh sitting in the fifth row, said she immediately ducked when she heard what she thought were shots. Ms. Koshut was all too familiar with active-shooter drills from school. “I dropped and rolled under the bleachers,” she said. “I didn’t even think.”\n\nOnstage, agents shielded Mr. Trump, trying to place themselves between him and any threat. Someone called out, “Sir, sir, sir!”\n\nSecret Service snipers, who are usually positioned away from the president on a roof or some other location, appeared out of nowhere, rushing onstage holding automatic rifles.\n\nMr. Trump initially seemed shocked and disoriented. As the agents tried to hustle him away, he said, “Let me get my shoes.”\n\n“I got you, sir,” said one of the agents. “I got you, sir.”\n\n“Let me get my shoes,” he repeated.\n\n“Hold that on your head,” an agent said. “It’s bloody.”\n\n“Sir, we’ve got to get moved to the car, sir,” said another. “Move to the car, sir.”\n\nAfter Mr. Trump thrilled the crowd with his fist pump and made it offstage on his own power, his arm draped over the shoulder of an agent, some in the crowd quickly saw political implications. “Trump was just elected today, folks,” one man shouted. “He is a martyr.”\n\nThe shooting came as Mr. Trump has been leading Mr. Biden in most polls, both nationally and in battleground states like Pennsylvania. Mr. Biden has been trying to quell an internal revolt from many Democrats who want him to step aside as a candidate following his unsteady and confused performance at a debate with Mr. Trump last month.\n\nJust hours before the attack in Pennsylvania, Mr. Biden assailed Mr. Trump for opposing gun control. “I want to ban assault weapons and require universal background checks,” the president wrote on social media. “Trump promised the NRA that he’d do nothing about guns. And he means it.”\n\nThe convention starting on Monday in Milwaukee will almost certainly be electrified by the Saturday shooting, both in terms of politics and security. A nominating convention already is viewed by authorities as a major security challenge, and officials will presumably be reviewing their plans for the G.O.P. conclave, which goes until Thursday.\n\nDonald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, said that he had spoken with his father by telephone after the attack and had found him in “great spirits,” according to a statement. “He will never stop fighting to save America, no matter what the radical left throws at him,” the younger Mr. Trump said.\n\nRepresentative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House Republican majority leader who was shot in the 2017 baseball practice incident, was more explicit in blaming the opposition for the attack. “For weeks Democrat leaders have been fueling ludicrous hysteria that Donald Trump winning re-election would be the end of democracy in America,” he said in a statement. “Clearly we’ve seen far left lunatics act on violent rhetoric in the past. This incendiary rhetoric must stop.”\n\nSenator J.D. Vance, a Republican from Ohio who is considered a front-runner to be named Mr. Trump’s running mate in the next few days, echoed the accusation. “Today is not just some isolated incident,” he wrote on social media. “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.”\n\nChris LaCivita, the former president’s campaign adviser, quickly cited the attack in making the case for Mr. Trump. “For years, and even today, leftist activists, democrat donors and now even @JoeBiden have made disgusting remarks and descriptions of shooting Donald Trump it’s high time they be held accountable for it the best way is through the ballot box,” he wrote on social media. It was unclear what remarks by Mr. Biden he was citing.\n\nTwo conservative billionaires, Elon Musk and Bill Ackman, chose the moment to endorse Mr. Trump. Mr. Musk assailed the Secret Service and suggested the former president’s agents might have intentionally exposed him to danger. “Extreme incompetence or it was deliberate,” he wrote on his social media site. “Either way, the SS leadership must resign.”\n\nA couple far-right House members blamed Mr. Biden, citing his recent comment that it was time to stop talking about the debate and “put Trump in a bull’s-eye.” Representative Lauren Boebert, Republican of Colorado, said in a television interview that “Joe Biden is responsible for the shooting.” Representative Mike Collins, Republican of Georgia, wrote on social media that “Joe Biden sent the orders.”\n\nFor their part, ranking Democrats made no mention of partisan politics in their statements, confining their comments to expressions of outrage over the attack, relief that Mr. Trump had survived and general concern about political violence in the United States.\n\nIn addition to Mr. Biden, Democrats who quickly denounced the attempt on Mr. Trump’s life included some of his most vocal critics, like former President Barack Obama, Vice President Kamala Harris, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representatives Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Nancy Pelosi of California.\n\n“I thank God that former President Trump is safe,” said Ms. Pelosi, the former House speaker whose husband was critically wounded by a hammer-wielding attacker who broke into their San Francisco home in 2022 looking for her.\n\nPeter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times. He has covered the last five presidents and sometimes writes analytical pieces that place presidents and their administrations in a larger context and historical framework.\n\nSimon J. Levien is a Times political reporter covering the 2024 elections and a member of the 2024-25 Times Fellowship class, a program for journalists early in their careers.\n\nMichael Gold is a political correspondent for The Times covering the campaigns of Donald J. Trump and other candidates in the 2024 presidential elections.\n\n## Related Content\n\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump on Friday vowed to hold another campaign rally in the same area of Pennsylvania where he survived an assassination attempt less than two weeks earlier.\n\nTrump said the forthcoming rally in Butler will honor Corey Comperatore, a firefighter who was killed in the July 13 attack, as well as others who were injured.\n\n\"FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT!\" Trump wrote in an all-caps Truth Social post announcing the rally, referring to the three words he mouthed to his supporters in the moments after the shooting.\n\nTrump's Friday afternoon post lacked specifics about when and where the rally would take place. The Trump campaign plans to hold indoor rallies in light of the assassination attempt, sources familiar with the campaign told NBC News.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service has reportedly advised the campaign to stop holding outdoor rallies.\n\nTrump sustained a minor injury to his ear in the incident, which he and his former White House physician, current Rep. Ronny Jackson, maintain was caused by the assassin's bullet.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray testified Wednesday that Trump's injury might have instead been caused by shrapnel, spurring anger from the Republican presidential nominee's allies.\n\nTrump also lashed out at Wray, writing in another Truth Social post on Friday that the director's remarks were \"so damaging to the Great People that work in the FBI.\"",

        "content": "# CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz speaks out after failed tech update causes worldwide chaos at airports and banks\n\nThe CEO of the cybersecurity firm at the heart of Microsoft’s worldwide outage choked on his words as he apologized for wreaking havoc early Friday — but couldn’t give a timeline for when everything would return to normal.\n\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz addressed the major tech outages after his company deployed a faulty software update to computers overnight that ended up grounding flights, knocking banks offline and media outlets off the air across the globe.\n\n“We’re deeply sorry for the impact that we’ve caused to customers, to travelers, to anyone affected by this,” Kurtz said in an appearance on NBC’s “Today.”\n\nAt one point, a nervous-sounding Kurtz choked up and had to pause to sip water before explaining the cause of the massive disruptions.\n\n“It wasn’t a cyberattack, it was related to this content update,” he said.“The system was sent an update, and that update had a software bug in it and caused an issue with the Microsoft operating system.”\n\nAsked how a single content update could trigger such widespread outages and upend industries, Kurtz acknowledged that the company would have to “go back and see what happened.”\n\n“If there’s a negative interaction with the way some of these operating systems work — in this particular case, it was, it was only a Microsoft operating system that was impacted — you’ll see a reaction like this,” he said.\n\nHe added that the update was normal and part of the company’s standard process to prevent security risks.\n\nDespite already identifying and deploying a fix for the issue, the CEO couldn’t give a timeline for when all systems would be back up and running again.\n\n“As you might imagine, we’ve been on with our customers all night,” he said. “Many of the customers are rebooting the system and it’s coming up operational because we fixed it on our end.”\n\n“It could be some time,” he added. “Sometimes, some systems won’t automatically recover … we’re not going to relent until we get every customer back to where they were.”\n\nKurtz also wouldn’t say if the breadth of the disruptions had shocked him.\n\n“When you look at software, it’s a very complex world and always staying ahead of the adversary is certainly a tall task,” he said.\n\n“These sorts of things, obviously you try to understand and mitigate them and, in some cases, you have a weird interaction,” Kurtz continued. “We’re just trying to sort where that negative reaction was.”\n\nIn an alert sent out to CrowdStrike clients overnight, the company said its “Falcon Sensor” software had caused Microsoft Windows to crash and display a blue screen — known informally as the “blue screen of death.”\n\n### Start your day with all you need to know\n\nMorning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.\n\n### Thanks for signing up!\n\nMicrosoft said the underlying cause of the global outage had been fixed as of early Friday — but the impact of cybersecurity outages was continuing to affect some Office 365 apps and services.\n\nThe chaos, however, was still being felt across the world hours later.\n\nMajor US airlines — American, Delta and United — were among those to ground flights, while other carriers and airports around the world also reported delays and disruptions.\n\nLaGuardia Airport canceled 30 flights and delayed 10, while JFK travelers faced lengthy delays amid 16 canceled flights.\n\nNews outlets in Australia — where telecommunications were severely affected — were pushed off air for hours.\n\nBanks and financial services companies in various countries also reported issues.",

        "content": "# What we know about the computer update glitch disrupting systems around the world\n\nA technological meltdown left employees of airlines, banks, hospitals and emergency services around the world staring at the dreaded “blue screen of death” on Friday as their computers went inert in what is being described as a historic outage.\n\n“This is basically what we were all worried about with Y2K, except it's actually happened this time,” internet security analyst Troy Hunt said via X.\n\nFrom continent to continent, Microsoft users reported being suddenly knocked offline, and the culprit was determined to be cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, which says one of its routine software updates malfunctioned.\n\n“CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,” the company said in a statement.\n\nCustomers using Mac and Linux operating systems were not affected, CrowdStrike said.\n\nWhen the faulty update crashed computer systems, scores of airport travelers were stranded, hospital appointments were delayed and live news broadcasts were cut short.\n\n### How big is the outage?\n\nIt is massive, far-reaching and sudden.\n\nSome computer problems cascade, creating ripples of failures. But in this case, the flaw permeated Microsoft systems worldwide nearly immediately. The company says its Windows 365 Cloud PCs, apps and services were affected.\n\nMicrosoft remains the dominant desktop operating system worldwide, with more than 72% market share, according to the Statcounter website. The CrowdStrike problem does not directly affect all of those machines: its security software is mainly used by businesses and large organizations. The company says its customers include 43 U.S. states and nearly 300 companies in the Fortune 500.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Microsoft outages were reported on Friday, according to Downdetector, the website that tracks outages based on users’ reports.\n\nIn 16 hours, 311,000 global outage reports came in, Michelle Badrian, senior communications manager at Ookla, which owns Downdetector, told NPR. Of that figure, she added, 58,000 reports were from the U.S., 26,000 from the U.K., and 20,000 from India. Large numbers of reports also came in from Germany, Canada and Australia.\n\nThere are signs that relief is on the way: Badrian said that as of midday Friday ET, “we are observing report volumes declining both for Microsoft services and for all services overall.”\n\nWhile server-related outages are common, the scale of the CrowdStrike disruption was astonishing to many tech observers.\n\n“This IT outage is a stark reminder of how dependent we are on technology and many other things that happen behind the scenes that most of us are unaware of,” said Louisville-based tech executive Adam Robinson on X. “Modern society and the many comforts we enjoy is a fragile thing.”\n\n### What about air travel?\n\nMore than 2,000 flights originating or landing in the U.S. were canceled as of noon ET Friday, and more than twice that number were delayed, according to the FlightAware tracking site.\n\nDelta Airlines, United Airlines and American Airlines announced they were resuming some or all of their scheduled flights after initially being grounded when the problem struck their systems. The airlines also said they were issuing waivers to affected customers.\n\nAmsterdam’s Schiphol Airport — a major hub for long-distance flights — said a \"global system failure\" impacted incoming and outgoing flights on one of the busiest days of the year.\n\nLandings at Zurich airport were suspended and flights in Hungary disrupted.\n\nSpanish airport operator Aena reported a computer systems “incident” at all Spanish airports that it said could cause delays.\n\n### What other kinds of services went offline?\n\nIn some states, including Alaska and Ohio, 911 phone lines were down.\n\nThe U.K.’s National Health Service has been widely affected. The NHS said Friday that doctors’ appointments and patient records had been affected but that there was no known impact on emergency services. The BBC reported that two-thirds of doctors’ practices in Northern Ireland had been affected, with doctors unable to access patient records, generate prescriptions or see the result of laboratory tests.\n\nIn Germany, some hospitals canceled non-emergency operations.\n\nBroadcasters around the world were also affected. In France and Australia, live television broadcasts were knocked offline.\n\nSky News, a major U.K. news channel, was off air for a time on Friday morning. It later returned, but without “full capabilities__,__” its chairman, David Rhodes, said on X Friday afternoon. A post on Australia’s ABC News website said the broadcaster was experiencing a “major network outage.”\n\nThe London Stock Exchange’s news service stopped working. Shipping in the Baltic was also impacted, with the container hub of Gdansk in Poland hit by major disruptions.\n\n### How do people fix their computers?\n\nCrowdStrike says the problem was not a cyberattack, but rather a software glitch. The company said that after identifying the issue, it withdrew the \"problematic channel file\" that was affecting customers' systems.\n\nBecause of that move, if a Windows system with CrowdStrike's Falcon sensor was brought online after 1:27 a.m. ET Friday , the company said, it wouldn't be affected.\n\nIt also published a workaround that involves booting a Windows machine in a recovery environment, deleting a single file in the CrowdStrike directory, and restarting.\n\n### What is CrowdStrike?\n\nIt’s a U.S. cybersecurity firm based in Austin, Texas. The company went public in 2019 and is currently in the S&P 500 index. As of early July, CrowdStrike’s stock had been riding months of gains. But share prices fell sharply in early trading Friday.\n\n“This is clearly a major black eye for CrowdStrike,” said WedBush analyst Dan Ives.\n\nCrowdStrike made headlines in 2016, when the company was hired by the Democratic National Committee to investigate a breach of its data systems. CrowdStrike determined that the hack was a case of foreign interference — the work of Russian-backed hacking groups.\n\nThe company’s marquee product is its “Falcon” cybersecurity software — and it traced the current problem to a change in a sensor in that system. That also helps explain how and why the resulting failures might have spread so quickly: Rather than being stored locally, the Falcon security platform “is 100% cloud-based.”\n\nThe company apologized for the outages on Friday, stating, \"We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption.\"\n\n*This is a developing story and will be updated.*",

        "content": "Businesses across the world have been hit by widespread disruptions to their Windows workstations stemming from a faulty update pushed out by cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.\n\n\"CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,\" the company's CEO George Kurtz said in a statement. \"Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted. This is not a security incident or cyber attack.\"\n\nThe company, which acknowledged \"reports of [Blue Screens of Death] on Windows hosts,\" further said it has identified the issue and a fix has been deployed for its Falcon Sensor product, urging customers to refer to the support portal for the latest updates.\n\nFor systems that have been already impacted by the problem, the mitigation instructions are listed below -\n\n- Boot Windows in Safe Mode or Windows Recovery Environment\n- Navigate to the C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\CrowdStrike directory\n- Find the file named \"C-00000291*.sys\" and delete it\n- Restart the computer or server normally\n\nIt's worth noting that the outage has also impacted Google Cloud Compute Engine, causing Windows virtual machines using CrowdStrike's csagent.sys to crash and go into an unexpected reboot state.\n\n\"After having automatically received a defective patch from CrowdStrike, Windows VMs crash and will not be able to reboot,\" it said. \"Windows VMs that are currently up and running should no longer be impacted.\"\n\nMicrosoft Azure has also posted a similar update, stating it \"received reports of successful recovery from some customers attempting multiple Virtual Machine restart operations on affected Virtual Machines\" and that \"several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required.\"\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), for its part, said it has taken steps to mitigate the issue for as many Windows instances, Windows Workspaces, and Appstream Applications as possible, recommending customers still affected by the issue to \"take action to restore connectivity.\"\n\nSecurity researcher Kevin Beaumont said \"I have obtained the CrowdStrike driver they pushed via auto update. I don't know how it happened, but the file isn't a validly formatted driver and causes Windows to crash every time.\"\n\n\"CrowdStrike is the top tier EDR product, and is on everything from point-of-sale to ATMs etc. – this will be the biggest 'cyber' incident worldwide ever in terms of impact, most likely.\"\n\nAirlines, financial institutions, food and retail chains, hospitals, hotels, news organizations, railway networks, and telecom firms are among the many businesses affected. Shares of CrowdStrike have tanked 15% in U.S. premarket trading.\n\nThe Texas-based firm, which serves over 530 companies in the Fortune 1,000, develops endpoint detection and response (EDR) software that are given entrenched, privileged access to the operating system's kernel to flag and block security threats. However, this access also gives them wide-ranging powers to disrupt the very systems they are trying to secure.\n\n\"The current event appears – even in July – that it will be one of the most significant cyber issues of 2024,\" Omer Grossman, Chief Information Officer (CIO) at CyberArk, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. \"The damage to business processes at the global level is dramatic. The glitch is due to a software update of CrowdStrike's EDR product.\"\n\n\"This is a product that runs with high privileges that protects endpoints. A malfunction in this can, as we are seeing in the current incident, cause the operating system to crash.\"\n\nThe recovery is expected to take days as the problem needs to be solved manually, endpoint by endpoint, by starting them in Safe Mode and removing the buggy driver, Grossman pointed out, adding the root cause behind the malfunction will be of the \"utmost interest.\"\n\nJake Moore, global security advisor at Slovakian cybersecurity company ESET, told The Hacker News that the incident serves to highlight the need for implementing multiple \"fail safes\" in place and diversifying IT infrastructure.\n\n\"Upgrades and maintenance to systems and networks can unintentionally include small errors, which can have wide-reaching consequences as experienced today by CrowdStrike's customers,\" Moore said.\n\n\"Another aspect of this incident relates to 'diversity' in the use of large-scale IT infrastructure. This applies to critical systems like operating systems (OSes), cybersecurity products, and other globally deployed (scaled) applications. Where diversity is low, a single technical incident, not to mention a security issue, can lead to global-scale outages with subsequent knock-on effects.\"\n\nThe development comes as Microsoft is recovering from a separate outage of its own that caused issues with Microsoft 365 apps and services, including Defender, Intune, OneNote, OneDrive for Business, SharePoint Online, Windows 365, Viva Engage, and Purview.\n\n\"A configuration change in a portion of our Azure backend workloads, caused interruption between storage and compute resources which resulted in connectivity failures that affected downstream Microsoft 365 services dependent on these connections,\" the tech giant said.\n\nOmkhar Arasaratnam, general manager of OpenSSF, said the Microsoft-CrowdStrike outages underscore the fragility of monocultural supply chains and emphasized the import ance of diversity in technology stacks for greater resilience and security.\n\n\"Monocultural supply chains (single operating system, single EDR) are inherently fragile and susceptible to systemic faults – as we've seen,\" Arasaratnam pointed out. \"Good system engineering tells us that changes in these systems should be rolled out gradually, observing the impact in small tranches vs. all at once. More diverse ecosystems can tolerate rapid change as they're resilient to systemic issues.\"\n\n### Falcon Fallout Unleashes Phishing Attacks\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has warned of malicious actors attempting to capitalize on the worldwide IT disruption caused by a flawed software update to the CrowdStrike Falcon EDR platform that has crippled countless Microsoft Windows computers.\n\n\"Threat actors continue to use the widespread IT outage for phishing and other malicious activity,\" the agency said, urging \"organizations to ensure they have robust cybersecurity measures to protect their users, assets, and data against this activity.\"\n\nThis includes setting up scam domains and phishing pages – crowdstrikebluescreen[.]com, crowdstrike-bsod[.]com, and crowdstrike0day[.]com – purporting to offer remediation and recovery scripts to address the BSoD issue in exchange for a cryptocurrency payment.\n\nOther kinds of activity observed range from impersonating CrowdStrike staff in phone calls to posing as independent researchers and claiming to have evidence the technical issue is linked to a cyber attack.\n\nCrowdStrike, which has since apologized for the havoc caused by the botched update, said it \"understands the gravity and impact of the situation\" and that it's aware \"adversaries and bad actors will try to exploit events like this.\"\n\nThe company has also shared additional technical details that led to Windows systems experiencing what's called a boot loop following the configuration update, noting it's currently performing a root cause analysis to determine \"how this logic flaw occurred.\"\n\n\"Sensor configuration updates are an ongoing part of the protection mechanisms of the Falcon platform,\" it said. \"This configuration update triggered a logic error resulting in a system crash and blue screen (BSOD) on impacted systems. The sensor configuration update that caused the system crash was remediated on Friday, July 19, 2024 05:27 UTC.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the disastrous glitch, Microsoft said it's \"working closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online.\"",

        "content": "# What we know about the computer update glitch disrupting systems around the world\n\nA technological meltdown left employees of airlines, banks, hospitals and emergency services around the world staring at the dreaded “blue screen of death” on Friday as their computers went inert in what is being described as a historic outage.\n\n“This is basically what we were all worried about with Y2K, except it's actually happened this time,” internet security analyst Troy Hunt said via X.\n\nFrom continent to continent, Microsoft users reported being suddenly knocked offline, and the culprit was determined to be cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, which says one of its routine software updates malfunctioned.\n\n“CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,” the company said in a statement.\n\nCustomers using Mac and Linux operating systems were not affected, CrowdStrike said.\n\nWhen the faulty update crashed computer systems, scores of airport travelers were stranded, hospital appointments were delayed and live news broadcasts were cut short.\n\n### How big is the outage?\n\nIt is massive, far-reaching and sudden.\n\nSome computer problems cascade, creating ripples of failures. But in this case, the flaw permeated Microsoft systems worldwide nearly immediately. The company says its Windows 365 Cloud PCs, apps and services were affected.\n\nMicrosoft remains the dominant desktop operating system worldwide, with more than 72% market share, according to the Statcounter website. The CrowdStrike problem does not directly affect all of those machines: its security software is mainly used by businesses and large organizations. The company says its customers include 43 U.S. states and nearly 300 companies in the Fortune 500.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Microsoft outages were reported on Friday, according to Downdetector, the website that tracks outages based on users’ reports.\n\nIn 16 hours, 311,000 global outage reports came in, Michelle Badrian, senior communications manager at Ookla, which owns Downdetector, told NPR. Of that figure, she added, 58,000 reports were from the U.S., 26,000 from the U.K., and 20,000 from India. Large numbers of reports also came in from Germany, Canada and Australia.\n\nThere are signs that relief is on the way: Badrian said that as of midday Friday ET, “we are observing report volumes declining both for Microsoft services and for all services overall.”\n\nWhile server-related outages are common, the scale of the CrowdStrike disruption was astonishing to many tech observers.\n\n“This IT outage is a stark reminder of how dependent we are on technology and many other things that happen behind the scenes that most of us are unaware of,” said Louisville-based tech executive Adam Robinson on X. “Modern society and the many comforts we enjoy is a fragile thing.”\n\n### What about air travel?\n\nMore than 2,000 flights originating or landing in the U.S. were canceled as of noon ET Friday, and more than twice that number were delayed, according to the FlightAware tracking site.\n\nDelta Airlines, United Airlines and American Airlines announced they were resuming some or all of their scheduled flights after initially being grounded when the problem struck their systems. The airlines also said they were issuing waivers to affected customers.\n\nAmsterdam’s Schiphol Airport — a major hub for long-distance flights — said a \"global system failure\" impacted incoming and outgoing flights on one of the busiest days of the year.\n\nLandings at Zurich airport were suspended and flights in Hungary disrupted.\n\nSpanish airport operator Aena reported a computer systems “incident” at all Spanish airports that it said could cause delays.\n\n### What other kinds of services went offline?\n\nIn some states, including Alaska and Ohio, 911 phone lines were down.\n\nThe U.K.’s National Health Service has been widely affected. The NHS said Friday that doctors’ appointments and patient records had been affected but that there was no known impact on emergency services. The BBC reported that two-thirds of doctors’ practices in Northern Ireland had been affected, with doctors unable to access patient records, generate prescriptions or see the result of laboratory tests.\n\nIn Germany, some hospitals canceled non-emergency operations.\n\nBroadcasters around the world were also affected. In France and Australia, live television broadcasts were knocked offline.\n\nSky News, a major U.K. news channel, was off air for a time on Friday morning. It later returned, but without “full capabilities__,__” its chairman, David Rhodes, said on X Friday afternoon. A post on Australia’s ABC News website said the broadcaster was experiencing a “major network outage.”\n\nThe London Stock Exchange’s news service stopped working. Shipping in the Baltic was also impacted, with the container hub of Gdansk in Poland hit by major disruptions.\n\n### How do people fix their computers?\n\nCrowdStrike says the problem was not a cyberattack, but rather a software glitch. The company said that after identifying the issue, it withdrew the \"problematic channel file\" that was affecting customers' systems.\n\nBecause of that move, if a Windows system with CrowdStrike's Falcon sensor was brought online after 1:27 a.m. ET Friday , the company said, it wouldn't be affected.\n\nIt also published a workaround that involves booting a Windows machine in a recovery environment, deleting a single file in the CrowdStrike directory, and restarting.\n\n### What is CrowdStrike?\n\nIt’s a U.S. cybersecurity firm based in Austin, Texas. The company went public in 2019 and is currently in the S&P 500 index. As of early July, CrowdStrike’s stock had been riding months of gains. But share prices fell sharply in early trading Friday.\n\n“This is clearly a major black eye for CrowdStrike,” said WedBush analyst Dan Ives.\n\nCrowdStrike made headlines in 2016, when the company was hired by the Democratic National Committee to investigate a breach of its data systems. CrowdStrike determined that the hack was a case of foreign interference — the work of Russian-backed hacking groups.\n\nThe company’s marquee product is its “Falcon” cybersecurity software — and it traced the current problem to a change in a sensor in that system. That also helps explain how and why the resulting failures might have spread so quickly: Rather than being stored locally, the Falcon security platform “is 100% cloud-based.”\n\nThe company apologized for the outages on Friday, stating, \"We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption.\"\n\n*This is a developing story and will be updated.*",

        "content": "###### By Kelsey Kendall\n\nEarlier this month, CrowdStrike’s buggy software update crashed many Windows computer systems, causing massive global disruptions to air travel, healthcare and businesses. Airlines are still trying to get back on track, and the outage hit companies with losses that could be in the billions of dollars, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThough not a cybersecurity-related incident, the outage revealed to many how complex and fragile our computer systems are. Sachin Shetty, executive director of the Center for Secure and Intelligent Critical Systems, says the outage could be used as an example of why these companies need to build a cybersecurity resilience culture to be prepared in case a cyber attack does happen.\n\n“In today’s world, every industry vertical uses computer software to offer services to customers,” Shetty said. “So, in essence, all industry verticals cross cutting commercial, defense and federal sectors are at risk for a cybersecurity attack.”\n\nShetty said there are two primary questions companies need to ask themselves as they consider how to prevent mass outages from happening: How quickly can a threat be detected? How quickly can the company respond?\n\nIt starts with developing a company-wide “cyber resilience culture,” Shetty explained. Building up this ability to respond to an attack impacts the company’s business continuity plans – plans that keep the business running in case of disruptive events – positively if implemented well.\n\nShetty recommends companies should assess how long it takes for their systems and people to detect an outage issue and identify the root cause. Improving this process can help companies in the future.\n\nAfter detection comes response. There should be backups and redundancies in their systems, Shetty said, so that companies can go back to previous, un-impacted critical systems and minimize disruptions to business operations.\n\nIt is also important to avoid “IT vendor homogeneity,” which means there are a limited number of systems being used. When one goes down, it is more difficult to move to something else while the problem is evaluated. That was one of the issues with the Microsoft outage. When the system went down, it was so widespread because of how many companies rely on the vendor and the lack of backup resources.\n\nShetty said there is no way of stopping attacks from happening. Threats can come from anywhere. What is important is figuring out how to respond when they do happen. Tabletop exercises and comprehensive looks at policies and procedures will help improve these responses and minimize costly disruptions.",

        "content": "A faulty component in the latest CrowdStrike Falcon update is crashing Windows systems, impacting various organizations and services across the world, including airports, TV stations, and hospitals.\n\nThe glitch is affecting Windows workstations and servers, with users reporting massive outages that took offline entire companies and fleets of hundreds of thousands of computers.\n\nAccording to some reports, emergency services in the U.S. and Canada have also been impacted.\n\n### Workaround for CrowdStrike glitched update\n\nFor the past few hours, users have been complaining about Windows hosts being stuck in a boot loop or showing the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) after installing the latest update for CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor.\n\nThe security vendor acknowledged the issue and published a technical alert explaining that its engineers “identified a content deployment related to this issue and reverted those changes.”\n\n“Symptoms include hosts experiencing a bugcheck\\blue screen error related to the Falcon Sensor,” CrowdStrike says in the tech alert.\n\nThe company revealed that the culprit is a Channel File, which contains data for the sensor (e.g. instructions). Since it is just a component of the update for the sensor, this type of file can be addressed individually without removing the Falcon Sensor update.\n\nFor those already affected, CrowdStrike provides the following workaround steps:\n\n- Boot Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment\n- Navigate to the C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\CrowdStrike directory\n- Locate the file matching “C-00000291*.sys”, and delete it.\n- Boot the host normally.\n\nGeorge Kurtz, the President and CEO of CrowdStrike announced a few minutes ago that the company “is actively working with customers” and confirmed that the problems are caused “by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts.”\n\n“We further recommend organizations ensure they’re communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels. Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers” - George Kurtz\n\nCrowdStrike’s CEO says that a fix is available and advises customers to access the support portal for the latest updates.\n\nIn an updated statement, CrowdStrike says that \"the problematic channel file [*C-00000291*.sys\" with timestamp of 0409 UTC*] has been reverted\" and the good version of it is **C-00000291*.sys** with timestamp of 0527 UTC or later.\n\nThe company also provides two options to address the issue in cloud and virtual environments, one variant being to roll back to a snapshot before 04:09 UTC. The second option is the following seven-step procedure:\n\n- Detach the operating system disk volume from the impacted virtual server\n- Create a snapshot or backup of the disk volume before proceeding further as a precaution against unintended changes\n- Attach/mount the volume to to a new virtual server\n- Navigate to the %WINDIR%\\System32\\drivers\\CrowdStrike directory\n- Locate the file matching “C-00000291*.sys”, and delete it.\n- Detach the volume from the new virtual server\n- Reattach the fixed volume to the impacted virtual server\n\n### Outage hits airlines and hospitals worldwide\n\nBy the time of the correction, though, many large organizations across multiple verticals had already been affected.\n\nSome reports say that CrowdStrike’s update impacted some 911 emergency service agencies in the state of New York (EMS, police, fire department), Alaska, and Arizona, as well as 911 services in parts of Canada.\n\nA 911 telecommunicator in Illinois said that they were “working off of paper until things come back.”\n\nThere also reports that the health hotline in Catalonia, Spain, is impacted and authorities are asking citizens not to call 061 unless there is an emergency.\n\nDutch broadcasting organization NOS said that the glitch created disruptions at Schiphol Airport and “forced several flights to be grounded” (operated by KLM and Transavia).\n\nMelbourne Airport said that it was experiencing “a global technology issue which is impacting check-in procedures for some airlines.” The most affected are passengers departing internationally via Jetstar and Scoot airlines.\n\nA few hours ago, in the latest update, the Zurich Airport says that \"flights with destination Zurich that are already in the air are still allowed to land,\" no aircrafts \"are currently taking off for Zurich Airport,\" and there are no departures to the U.S.\n\nFurthermore, there are delays and cancellations and passengers of individual airlines must be checked in manually.\n\nOther airports affected are in Berlin, Barcelona, Brisbane, Edinburgh, Amsterdam, and London.\n\nIn the U.S., the Federal Aviation Administration received requests to assist multiple airlines (American Airlines, United, Delta) with ground stops until \"a technical issue impacting IT systems\" is resolved.\n\nOn JFK and LaGuardia airports in the U.S., flights have been grounded due to outages from the CrowdStrike update, leaving passengers stranded.\n\nSome hospitals in the Netherlands - Scheper in Emmen, Slingeland Hospital in Achterhoek, and emergency posts in Hoogeveen and Stadskanaal were also impacted.\n\nIn Barcelona, the Terrassa University Hospital and the Catalan Oncology Institute experienced issues earlier today due to the CrowdStrike issue but have started to return to normal activity.\n\nIn the U.S., Bellevue hospital in New York and NYU Langone Hospital are also impacted.\n\nOn Friday morning, multiple television stations and news outlets, such as Sky News and ABC suffered disruptions as computers crashed.\n\nA large number of users started to spill their frustration in Reddit comments about tens and even hundred of thousands of computers crashing after CrowdStrike’s update and the impact on their companies:\n\nMalaysia here, 70% of our laptops are down and stuck in boot, HQ from Japan ordered a company wide shutdown\n\n210K BSODS all at 10:57 PST....and it keeps going up...this is bad....\n\nWorkstations and servers here in Aus... fleet of 50k+ - someone is going to have fun.\n\nFailing here is Australia too. Our entire company is offline\n\nSame here in OZ. Entire company is down.\n\nHalf the company down. Somehow it has hit our AWS servers also. Major service downtime for our customers\n\nEntire org and trading entities down here. Half of IT are locked out.\n\nSeeing major issues here in NZ at the moment, company wide outage impacting servers and workstations.\n\nSupporting Philippines and China Locations. All experiencing the same as well\n\n\nDespite a fix being deployed and CrowdStrike providing a workaround for Windows hosts already crashing, companies will feel the effects from the issue for a while.\n\nAdmins are going to have a long weekend, especially with computer fleets of tens or hundreds of thousands of computers, employees working remotely, off-premise data centers, or cloud environments where booting in safe mode is not an option.\n\n**Update [July 19, 09:59 ET]:** Article edited to include mitigation details for cloud and virtual environments.\n\n## 7 Security Best Practices for MCP\n\nAs MCP (Model Context Protocol) becomes the standard for connecting LLMs to tools and data, security teams are moving fast to keep these new services safe.\n\nThis free cheat sheet outlines 7 best practices you can start using today.\n\n## Comments\n\n## No1gr8 - 1 year ago\n\nBeing in at 1 am fixing servers is bad enough, and then the CrowdStrike CEO is like no big deal, just do the patch is salt in the wound.\n\n## dvblystone - 1 year ago\n\nI am getting alerts from quite a few providers that they are being affected by this. Not going to be a good day for them or for us. I am not a Crowdstrike customer but I am feeling the effects of it.\n\n## jpramirez - 1 year ago\n\nThat surely will cause not only a backlash on CrowdStrike but also on any major vendor like them, and with reason, for something like this to happen all quality controls and test failed, development chain is broken.\n\n## dvblystone - 1 year ago\n\nIt is called testing in production. LOL\n\n## powerspork - 1 year ago\n\nMicrosoft does it all the time. Eventually, someone else looks at their methods and decide its a great idea.\n\n## DyingCrow - 1 year ago\n\nThis ramps up the concept of \"domino effect\" considerably?\n\n## dvblystone - 1 year ago\n\nI think they need to stop saying that this is not a cybersecurity incident. They are a cybersecurity company with a cybersecurity product that caused an incident. Therefore it IS a cybersecurity incident.\n\n## KennethLeik - 1 year ago\n\nNo it is not. A cybersecurity incident would be if there was some vulnerability being exploited. This is just the same as any software developer adding a bugged version that makes Windows go into BSOD. The effect might be the same regarding unavailability, But the incident has to be classified as software bug incident, not cybersecurity!\n\n## dvblystone - 1 year ago\n\nYou are right, it is not a true cybersecurity incident. However, the more you say and try to deny something, the more you look guilty for it. That phrase should have never been used.\n\nWe can debate what should have been done or not done until the cows come home. Nothing will change what happened. I am hearing that the issue is being successfully resolved. I just hope that this does not ruin their reputation as a company and put them out of business.\n\n## Gh0st_Mav - 1 year ago\n\nIt depends on how you choose to view it. From the perspective of Crowdstrike customers, this incident has affected the availability of their services and going by the core tenets of cybersecurity (CIA:Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability), it can be classified as a cybersecurity incident. Its not necessarily a breach, but in the grand scheme of things as it concerns cybersecurity, availability was affected. From the perspective of Crowdstrike, it can be seen as a process issue. Someone dropped the ball along the lines of the operational chain.\n\n## DIMMReaper_ - 1 year ago\n\n\"I think they need to stop saying that this is not a cybersecurity incident. They are a cybersecurity company with a cybersecurity product that caused an incident. Therefore it IS a cybersecurity incident.\"\n\n\nNo this was a Cybersecurity company that rolled out an update without proper testing. It's not an incident is... stupidity that lead to likely the biggest IT Outage in the world, ever. The good thing is though, CS is a great product, it doesn't make me think less of them. They will fix this and make sure it never happens again. There's been other incidents like this with other providers, just not to this scale because everyone is drinking the CS Kool-aid, because it lets us sleep at night. Just sucked that it came right after a Cogent outage Monday, and a Microsoft issue Thurs/Friday. Between all that and having Covid... I'm beat lol.\n\n## itspoffy - 1 year ago\n\nThe impact is that of an attack regardless if it was self inflicted. Crowdstrike does a great job. The company I'm at now does not use it, but there is a saying, 1 oh s&&t destroys 1000 attaboys. I hope they recover and the backlash is limited.\n\n## CamboSoupBoy - 1 year ago\n\nOr 10 million ;P\n\n## NoneRain - 1 year ago\n\nThis 'oh sh1t' just affected 8.5 million devices that needs manual intervention. Hope they made 'attaboys' enough....\n\n## NoneRain - 1 year ago\n\nCrowdStrike really struck the crowd this time\n\n## ZeroYourHero - 1 year ago\n\nI don't think Microsoft will come out of this unscathed. From what I see there are numerous design problems with WinRE that techs are enjoying right now.\n\n## johnlsenchak - 1 year ago\n\nWorkers are getting fired at \" Crowd Strike\" you know it's coming\n\n## ZeroYourHero - 1 year ago\n\nOh, that was Carl's fault. He's new.\n\n## __TheWatchman__ - 1 year ago\n\nThe general consensus at the moment is that the outage was caused by human error in the update that was pushed out. If this is the case, this incident should not be considered a \"cyber security\" incident even though it is related to a cyber security vendor.\n\n\n\nIf foul play is involved, then the incident can be considered as an insider threat case and should be considered a \"cyber security\" incident.\n\nMy question is - if the cause was merely human error, how did the update pass through all of CrowdStrike's rigorous quality control tests without any issues, and yet was able to cause a global outage that affected, as I understand it, all versions of the Windows operating system currently in use.\n\n## JohnC_21 - 1 year ago\n\nNot all versions. Although I wouldn't exactly call Windows 3.1 current.\n\n\nhttps://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/southwest-cloudstrike-windows-3-1/\n\n## stevansky - 1 year ago\n\n\"how did the update pass through all of CrowdStrike's rigorous quality control tests\" I can see their quality control chief in their sombrero now, \"Quality control tests? We don't need no stinkin' quality control tests!\" as they approve the update and head home for the weekend.\n\n## Elastoer - 1 year ago\n\nI wonder how long it will be before the US Congress holds hearings about this?\n\n## Syra - 1 year ago\n\nThe recent CrowdStrike outage has had significant impacts globally, affecting everything from airlines to hospitals. As detailed in the latest blog post, this incident underscores the importance of robust cybersecurity testing and rapid response strategies.

        "content": "*We ran a quick fire poll on who was affected by the global IT outage on 19 July and here we take a look at the results, as well as opinions on what could have been done differently; and what we need to be looking at in terms of resilience and business continuity.*\n\nExactly one week ago today (26 July), US cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike infamously released an update to Windows systems that triggered a logic error: systems running Crowdstrike’s Falcon sensor for Windows 7.11 and above in many cases crashed and showed a blue screen of death (BSOD). Crowdstrike has since blamed a bug in its test software, and has promised to take steps to avoid a repeat of an incident that is estimated to have cost Fortune 500 companies over $5bn.\n\nPeople will likely remember where they were when they became aware of the outage, particularly if you work in IT, were due to fly, were in certain courts, in the middle of a transaction, or any variation of those ‘need to happen now’ situations that didn’t happen. Around 8.5m Microsoft devices were affected, forcing them into a boot loop. Tempers and viewpoints unsurprisingly ran high.\n\nAs organisations from banks to law firms to doctor’s surgeries in some cases still continue to pick up the pieces, there are serious questions being asked around what could have been done differently, other than the obvious, which is for Crowdstrike not to release the faulty update in the first place. While Crowdstrike gets the blame fair and square, is there an argument that Microsoft needs better resilience? Will firms be looking critically at their own business continuity and disaster recovery processes and procedures?\n\nA week on and it’s still fairly early days, but there are already some important takeaways and views worth sharing, as we get our heads around how – or more likely if – we could prevent anything like this happening again.\n\n**Who was affected? **\n\n\nIn a snap 24-hour poll on LinkedIn on 19 July, Legal IT Insider tried to gauge how badly the legal sector was affected by the outage – see those results above. The majority weren’t affected at all, according to our informal poll, but for 10% of firms, it had a significant impact. For 1%, it was debilitating.\n\nHeavy Crowdstrike shops were hit hardest but those firms we spoke to were also largely cloud-based. In the US, Steptoe & Johnson’s chief information officer Isidore Okoro told Legal IT Insider that the firm, where Crowdstrike is on every machine and server, is 100% cloud, commenting: “So the fix was much easier for us to implement than if we had physical servers on prem.”\n\nHe added: “Very few SaaS services were affected. So iManage Cloud, our Zoom phone system, Microsoft 365, etc. were still up and functioning fine. In fact, that was what saved our bacon. We are heavily invested in SaaS based services.”\n\nIn the UK, Sackers, which uses both Crowdstrike and Aderant Sierra, which was impacted, head of IT Danny O’Connor had a similar story, commenting: “I’m glad we’re mostly SaaS, so this has been someone else’s problem to fix.”\n\nReflecting the views of many, O’Connor said: “How on earth did this update get out of testing? It should go through different bands before it reaches production, so how did it come to be released?”\n\n**More regulation? **\n\nThis question from O’Connor is the million, or more like billion-dollar question, and the chaos and loss of business on Friday and beyond has led to calls for more regulation of big tech companies.\n\nProfessor Ciaran Martin, the former chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), who is speaking at ILTACON Europe in November, told Sky News: “Until governments and the industry get together and work out how to design out some of these flaws, I’m afraid we are likely to see more of these again.”\n\nNot all agree, to say the least. In a delightfully bombastic post on 21 July, digital media attorney and journalist Greg Bufithis said: ” I had to cringe by this tweet from FTC Chair Lina Khan who tried to make the current CrowdStrike/Microsoft global IT melt-down situation a crisis because of “big tech” and “consolidation”…Pardon my French, Lina, but how in fuck is it that you don’t understand systems, or their inherent complexity? Well, if you give someone a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”\n\nBufithis added: “Any of my regular readers know that I’m a little skeptical (ok, completely skeptical and cynical) of government regulators (including the DOJ, the FTC, the SEC, etc etc) being able to control and rein in Big Tech, and more importantly, bring about change that it timely, impactful, and meaningful in the long run. This lack of understanding of the complexity of our model technology-reliant, digital-first world is why all of these regulators need to rethink regulation and regulatory frameworks.”\n\nLet us also not forget that it was EU regulation that prevented Microsoft from keeping third parties out of the kernel space: concerned over Microsoft’s market dominance, the European Commission in 2009 secured a deal with Microsoft where it would give makers of security software the same level of access to Windows that Microsoft gets. Apple, on the other hand, in 2020 stopped giving developers access to its MacOS operating system, and consequently was not affected by the Crowdstrike update on Friday.\n\n**Business continuity and resilience **\n\nLike it or not, and whether we can agree on the solution or not, there is no doubt that the outage has (again) brought to the fore the business continuity risk of a global dependence on a small number of businesses.\n\nThe need to understand your supply chain was brought into sharp relief by global cyberattacks like Solar Winds but with the recent outage, experts are advising that organisations now need to identify dependencies and vulnerabilities in terms of resilience against disruptive events (so, not unlike a cyberattack.)\n\nMuch of the expert advice being dished out is well trodden ground – proactively identify dependencies and vulnerabilities; don’t put your eggs in one basket; work out where your single points of failure are; back up, and actively and aggressively stress test.\n\nBut the outage has many IT heads shaken and thinking about any areas where we can do things differently. One question being raised is whether we need to rethink automatic updates. Cybersecurity member group ISC2 has a post worth reading on some of the lessons learned, and says: “Depending on the organization and the operating scenario, it may or may not be worth the risk of allowing systems to acquire and deploy their own updates automatically. That means either pulling those updates into an internal testing environment, or at least have direct automated updates disabled in favor of polling a centrally managed update server as part of a managed enterprise patch deployment solution. The latter can at least allow time to be built into the deployment process, to lower the risk of defective updates being rolled out to critical systems and users before issues are discovered.” This feels like a backwards step resource wise for cloud-based firms that are redeploying and retraining their IT staff.\n\n**Microsoft, to blame, or not to blame? **\n\nOne question we have posed on LinkedIn, which has caused significant debate, is whether Microsoft itself should not have been more resilient.\n\nWhile Legal IT Insider has seemingly been in the minority in arguing this point, J.J. Guy, CEO of Sevco Security made an interesting point on LinkedIn: “Yes, CrowdStrike pushed a kernel-level update that causes widespread blue screens. Yes, that should have been caught during quality assurance (QA)… This is a high-impact incident not because there was a blue screen, but because it causes repeated blue screens on reboot and [appears as of right now] to require manual, command-line intervention on each box to remediate (and even harder if BitLocker is enabled).\n\n“That is the result of poor resiliency in the Microsoft Windows operating system. Any software causing repeated failures on boot should not be automatically reloaded. We’ve got to stop crucifying CrowdStrike for one bug, when it is the OS’s behavior that is causing the repeated, systemic failures.”\n\nAs usual, where technology and in particular cybersecurity is involved, the issue is complicated.\n\nBen Swindale, CTO of Grant Thornton in Australia, told us on LinkedIn: “If Microsoft blocked alternate suppliers and forced their solution (Defender) as the only option or the default option, I’m sure the antitrust regulators would be back on their case. This is a Crowdstrike issue, I think it’s a stretch to put the blame on others.”\n\nDaniel Pollick, who is an independent IT consultant and Lawtech mentor among other things, was CIO of DLA Piper when it got hit by the NotPetya malware attack, added: “Yes it’s dopey architecture but imagine instead of a bad update causing a BSOD a bad actor had penetrated Crowdstrike’s updater and done far worse? That’s getting close to very bad. It’s basically what happened with NotPetya (I have the scars!) but a thousand timed worse.”\n\nInterestingly, better education and implementation could have played a part in minimising the impact, and Mike Walker, chief innovation and technology officer at Peppermint, said: “There is a recovery mode in the boot process but only if implemented, which would have noted a bad driver and auto disabled it…hence the reboot many times suggestions. The issue here is it needs to be configured and deployed properly.”\n\nHe added: “There is a Windows Recovery Environment and it is possible to remote manage as well so architecturally the issue is education and implementation.”\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIn an interconnected world, cybersecurity experts are predicting that global tech outages such as this one are inevitable. There are a few conclusions and takeaways, and we’re sure you can add to this.\n\n- Review your supply chain regularly\n- Revisit your business continuity and disaster recovery plans\n- Review your resourcing arrangements (people fixed this problem)\n- Take on the wider lessons from this disaster (see Mike Walker’s observations above, for example)\n- Be agile to change\n\nHelpfully or unhelpfully, the outage is a reminder that even the largest tech vendors can completely screw up.",

        "content": "Microsoft has published a comprehensive official guide to troubleshoot and fix the dreaded Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) on Windows 11 and Windows 10 systems.\n\nThe detailed documentation, updated on May 11, 2025, comes in the wake of several high-profile system crashes, including the global outage in July 2024 caused by a faulty CrowdStrike update that triggered widespread system failures with error codes 0x50 and 0x7E.\n\nBlue Screen errors, officially known as stop errors or bug checks, occur when Windows encounters a critical system failure that requires immediate shutdown to prevent data loss or hardware damage.\n\nUsers typically see a blue screen with the message “Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer” along with specific error codes that help identify the underlying issue.\n\n**Troubleshooting Windows Stop Errors**\n\nThe new guide divides troubleshooting into basic and advanced steps, with particular attention to common error codes such as PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (0x00000050), which indicates invalid system memory has been referenced.\n\nAccording to Microsoft Report, approximately 75% of all stop errors are caused by faulty drivers, making driver verification a central focus of the guidance.\n\nFor basic troubleshooting, Microsoft recommends first removing any recently added hardware that may have triggered the error.\n\nUsers are then advised to boot into Safe Mode by holding the Shift key while selecting Power > Restart, followed by Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings.\n\nFrom Safe Mode, checking Device Manager for hardware with warning indicators (marked by exclamation points) can help identify problematic components requiring driver updates.\n\n“Ensuring sufficient free disk space is critical, with 10-15% free space recommended for essential operating system functions,” the guide states.\n\nInstalling the latest Windows Updates and using System Restore for persistent issues completes the basic approach.\n\nThe advanced section details using Event Viewer to identify critical errors coinciding with crashes and running Windows Memory Diagnostics by typing “Memory” in the search box and selecting the diagnostic tool.\n\nFor IT professionals, the guide explains memory dump analysis using WinDbg with commands like “!analyze -v” to pinpoint exact failure points.\n\nDriver Verifier, a powerful diagnostic tool, receives special attention with warnings about its resource-intensive nature.\n\n“Driver Verifier consumes lots of CPU and can slow down the computer significantly,” the guide cautions, recommending testing suspicious drivers in groups of 10-20 rather than all at once.\n\nThe guide also addresses hardware-specific troubleshooting, including checking for overheating components and running disk diagnostics via the “chkdsk” command.\n\nThe guide draws on recent incidents, such as the July 2024 global outage caused by a faulty CrowdStrike update, which led to widespread BSODs with codes like 0x50 and 0x7E.\n\nMicrosoft’s updated guidance incorporates lessons learned from these events, emphasizing the importance of regular updates and robust driver management.\n\n**Setting Up SOC Team? – Download Free Ultimate SIEM Pricing Guide (PDF) For Your SOC Team -> ****Free Download**",

        "content": "Major airlines, medical facilities, businesses and police forces around the world were hit by a massive information technology glitch Friday, with Microsoft computers around the world showing \"Blue Screens of Death.\"\n\nThe cybersecurity company CrowdStrike said Friday that the outages were the result of a routine software update gone wrong, \"not a security incident or cyberattack.\"\n\nCrowdStrike, which provides cybersecurity services and software for many large corporations that use Microsoft systems, later issued a new software update that automatically fixed some computers. But others must be manually restarted and patched, causing huge delays.\n\nMicrosoft announced late Friday morning that its 365 apps and services had recovered, and CrowdStrike said a fix had been deployed early in the morning. But some frozen computers couldn’t receive CrowdStrike’s automatic update, leading to some of the problems lingering into the weekend.\n\nMany flights were delayed as of Friday afternoon. Starbucks locations in New York had resumed normal wait times, despite its mobile order-ahead feature still not working.\n\nThe glitch brought chaos to a number of key institutions and businesses around the world that may take some time to clear up.\n\nMany flights were grounded across the globe, and stores and broadcasters in several countries went offline. According to the aviation technology company FlightAware, the tech glitch was responsible for more than half of the U.S.'s 1,352 flight delays and cancellations before 8 a.m. ET on Friday.\n\nMajor carriers, including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, all issued ground stops Friday morning citing communications issues. Passengers traveling to the United States from as far away as Japan had their flights canceled. Delta ordered a “global ground stop,” said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of the House subcommittee on cybersecurity.\n\n*Follow live updates on the global tech outage*\n\nGeorge Kurtz, president and CEO of CrowdStrike, said the problems could persist.\n\n“It could be some time for some systems that just automatically won’t recover,” he told NBC’s “TODAY” show on Friday.\n\nKurtz said the company was “deeply sorry for the impact that we’ve caused to customers, to travelers, to anyone affected by this,” adding the issue had been fixed on its end.\n\n“Many of the customers are rebooting the system, and it’s coming up, and it’ll be operational because we fixed it on our end,” he said. “We’re just trying to sort out where the negative interaction was,” he said of the faulty update that affected Windows PCs.\n\nEarlier, in a post on X, Kurtz said that the outages were due to a “defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts.”\n\nIn Europe, Berlin’s Brandenburg Airport said there would be delays to passenger check-ins “because of a technical fault,” and Aena, which manages 46 airports in Spain, said “an incident in the computer system” could cause delays. Several budget airlines in South Korea reported technical problems and delays, The Associated Press said. Sydney Airport, one of Australia’s largest, said there would be delays.\n\nParis' airport authority said in a statement that while its systems were not affected ahead of next week's Olympic Games opening ceremony, \"this situation has an impact on the operations of airlines at Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Paris-Orly airports: delays in check-in, delays and temporary suspension of some flights,\" according to the AP.\n\nThe Paris Olympics organizing committee told Reuters that while the outage was slowing its operations, its ticket sales remained unaffected. Elsewhere in the world of sports, British soccer team Manchester United delayed a ticket release scheduled for Friday, blaming problems with Microsoft.\n\nThat was just one of many businesses affected across the United Kingdom, with train operators blaming IT outages for cancellations Friday morning and the London Stock Exchange saying that a “3rd party global technical issue” had prevented its regulatory news service from posting any new items.\n\nThe country’s National Health Service posted on X that “the NHS is aware of a global IT outage and an issue with a [general practitioner] appointment and patient record system.” The NHS that the system’s emergency phone service was still operating.\n\nIn Israel, at least 15 major hospitals were affected, according to media there. However, most medical centers had either returned to normal operations or reverted to manual operations. The emergency line of the country’s ambulance service was also affected.\n\nAt 2:20 a.m. ET, Alaska State Troopers said that 911 and nonemergency phone numbers across the state were not working “due to a nationwide technology-related outage.\"\n\nThe glitch affected news outlets, too, including NBC News. Sky News, NBC News' British partner broadcaster, was temporarily** **unable to air live news. Broadcasters in Australia also reported problems.\n\nIn a blog posted late Friday afternoon, Kurtz wrote that CrowdStrike staffers would be on call over the weekend to help affected customers, and warned of hackers and scammers exploiting the situation.\n\n“We know that adversaries and bad actors will try to exploit events like this,\" he said. \"I encourage everyone to remain vigilant and ensure that you’re engaging with official CrowdStrike representatives.\"",

        "content": "On Friday, July 19, 2024, an endpoint detection and response update from CrowdStrike triggered one of the largest global IT outages in history. Airports shut down and commercial airlines were grounded, stock exchanges and credit card processors could not facilitate financial transactions, 911 emergency services were disrupted and hospitals and physicians were unable to administer care. Furthermore, Amazon, Starbucks and other large e-tailers and retailers experienced operational and logistical issues, and scores of other industries were crippled. Many tried to make sense of the outage and determine root cause in the early hours, while others were quick to dismiss the incident as simply a bad day for the company.\n\nAs the dust settles and the details continue to trickle out from CrowdStrike and its chief executive George Kurtz, I will unpack what happened, why the blast radius was so enormous, what could have been done to prevent the outage and the future implications for CrowdStrike, its customers and the cybersecurity industry.\n\n## CrowdStrike Falcon Causes Chaos\n\nCrowdStrike Falcon is a cloud-native cybersecurity platform that is designed to deliver identity management and endpoint security. Like many other comparable solutions, Falcon ingests threat intelligence from multiple sources and leverages a high degree of AI and automation to thwart attacks and mitigate breaches. The massive IT outage that occurred can be traced back to a routine automated Falcon content update that corrupted devices running Microsoft Windows. Given the nature of Falcon’s highly privileged access and deep integration at the Microsoft operating system’s pipeline execution level (not at the kernel as previously assumed), this triggered what the technology industry calls the “blue screen of death” on Windows devices around the world.\n\nCoincidentally, just four days before the incident, on July 15, CrowdStrike issued a press release related to its next-generation Falcon managed detection and response service. MDR augments EDR by offering a concierge-level service with security analysts who provide 24/7 environment monitoring, threat hunting, investigation and remediation. This CrowdStrike announcement may be unrelated to what occurred with the flubbed Falcon EDR content update, but it warrants further investigation to determine if code may have been rushed to production.\n\n## An Enormous Blast Radius\n\nGiven the staggering size of the blast radius, CrowdStrike will have many questions to answer, including in an upcoming U.S. congressional investigation. The company has a massive customer base, given that 60% of the Fortune 500 use its products, including most of the largest financial service and healthcare providers, manufacturers and food and beverage companies in the world.\n\n### Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\n\n### Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\n\nSince the Falcon EDR content update was pushed to remote endpoints and delivered as a boot start driver, physical access to each affected device is required for remediation. There are remote-access solutions such as TeamViewer that can troubleshoot and resolve many issues, but the nature of Falcon’s driver architecture prevents the use of such tools. To complicate matters, recent reports indicate that individual devices require re-booting multiple times (up to fifteen in some instances). This presents unique challenges in environments such as airports, where staffing knowledge of technical procedures is typically extremely low.\n\n## Could It Have Been Prevented?\n\nThe million-dollar question—more likely a billion-dollar question—is what could have prevented such a devastating global IT outage. Modern continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment pipelines coupled with test environments are designed to provide a failsafe mechanism that catches bad code and allows rollback. This is especially important with delivery methods such as boot start drivers. CrowdStrike first reported that it had initiated a rollback, but later announced a software update to resolve the issue. The latter likely resulted from the technical barriers to initiating a rollback—something CrowdStrike developers should have known was not a possibility—and only added frustration and confusion to the situation.\n\nMicrosoft recently reported that approximately 8.5 million devices were affected by the operating system logic error triggered by the CrowdStrike content update, representing less than one percent of all Windows machines. However, it is becoming glaringly apparent that the small population of affected devices included a large amount of critical infrastructure. What is also somewhat troubling is that CrowdStrike CEO Kurtz presided over a similar incident in 2010 while serving as the chief technology officer at McAfee, as recently disclosed by Moor Insights & Strategy principal analyst Anshel Sag. From my perspective, a failure within CrowdStrike’s developer operations process and weak management oversight were to blame for the recent havoc.\n\n## Future Implications Of The CrowdStrike Fiasco\n\nThe financial and reputation damage tied to the Falcon content update misfire will likely be substantial. For CrowdStrike, its stock has already lost significant value given the concerns tied to the aftermath of the incident, and longer term the company will likely lose customers and face lawsuits tied to the hundreds of millions in lost revenue and opportunity costs for its customers. For enterprises and other organizations that use CrowdStrike Falcon, their reputation could be immeasurably damaged and result in the loss of customers. As a case in point, at the time of writing, Delta Airlines continues to send home stranded passengers from its Atlanta airport hub—many of whom have been waiting days for rebooking.\n\nThis is a seminal moment for the cybersecurity industry, one that can be a learning experience. Integrations will continue among software platforms to provide the highest levels of endpoint security. I believe CrowdStrike can recover and rise to the challenge given its technical depth, but it must put measures in place to prevent a future occurrence—and convince its wary customers that they can trust it again.\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy provides or has provided paid services to technology companies, like all tech industry research and analyst firms.

        "content": "Thousands of Windows machines are experiencing a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) issue at boot today, impacting banks, airlines, TV broadcasters, supermarkets, and many more businesses worldwide. A faulty update from cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike is knocking affected PCs and servers offline, forcing them into a recovery boot loop so machines can’t start properly. The issue is not being caused by Microsoft but by third-party CrowdStrike software that’s widely used by many businesses worldwide for managing the security of Windows PCs and servers.\n\n# Major Windows BSOD issue hits banks, airlines, and TV broadcasters\n\nA faulty update from cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike is responsible for the global outage.\n\nA faulty update from cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike is responsible for the global outage.\n\n*Notepad*, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.\n\nAustralian banks, airlines, and TV broadcasters first raised the alarm as thousands of machines started to go offline. The issues spread fast as businesses based in Europe started their workday. UK broadcaster Sky News was unable to broadcast its morning news bulletins for hours this morning and was showing a message apologizing for “the interruption to this broadcast.” Ryanair, one of the biggest airlines in Europe, also says it’s experiencing a “third-party” IT issue, which is impacting flight departures.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says it’s assisting airlines like Delta, United, and American Airlines due to communications issues. “The FAA is closely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at US airlines,” says FAA spokesperson Jeannie Shiffer in a statement to *The Verge*. “Several airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops for their fleets until the issue is resolved.”\n\nThe Berlin airport is also warning of travel delays due to “technical issues.” Many 911 emergency call centers in Alaska have also been impacted by the issues. One airline in India has even turned to handwritten boarding passes due to the outages.\n\n“CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,” says CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz in a post on X. “Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted. This is not a security incident or cyberattack.”\n\nCrowdStrike says the issue has been identified and a fix has been deployed, but fixing these machines won’t be simple for IT admins. The root cause appears to be an update to the kernel-level driver that CrowdStrike uses to secure Windows machines. While CrowdStrike identified the issue and reverted the faulty update after “widespread reports of BSODs on Windows hosts,” it doesn’t appear to help machines that have already been impacted.\n\nIn a Reddit thread, hundreds of IT admins are reporting widespread issues, and the workaround steps involve booting affected Windows machines into safe mode and navigating to the CrowdStrike directory and deleting a system file. That will be troublesome on some cloud-based servers or even for Windows laptops that are deployed and used remotely.\n\n“Our entire company is offline,” says one Reddit poster, while another says 70 percent of their laptops are down and stuck in a boot loop. “Happy Friday,” says one Reddit poster. It looks like it’s going to be a long day for IT admins worldwide.\n\nIn what appears to be a separate outage, Microsoft is also recovering from several issues with its Microsoft 365 apps and services. The root cause of those issues was down to “a configuration change in a portion of our Azure backend workloads.”\n\n**Follow topics and authors**from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.",

        "content": "Businesses across the world are reporting IT outages, including Windows “blue screen of death” errors on their computers, in what has already become one of the most widespread IT disruptions in recent years. The outage — linked to a software update from popular cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike — has affected computers running Microsoft Windows at organizations across various sectors, including airlines, banks, retailers, brokerage houses, media companies and railway networks. The travel sector seems to be one of the hardest hit, based on online chatter.\n\nCrowdStrike’s chief executive, George Kurtz, confirmed in a post on X that a “defect” in a content update for Windows hosts had caused the outage, and Kurtz ruled out a cyberattack. He added that the firm was rolling out a fix and that Mac and Linux hosts were not affected.\n\n“CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts. Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted,” Kurtz noted on X.\n\n“This is not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed. We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website. We further recommend organizations ensure they’re communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels. Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers,” Kurtz said.\n\nLater Friday, the U.S. cyber agency, the CISA, said that even though the outage wasn’t linked to any suspicious activity, it has “observed threat actors taking advantage of this incident for phishing and other malicious activity.”\n\nA post on CrowdStrike’s support forums (which are only accessible with a login) also acknowledged the issue early on Friday, saying the company had received reports of crashes related to a content update. CrowdStrike said the crash reports were “related to the Falcon Sensor” — its cloud-based security service that it describes as “real-time threat detection, simplified management, and proactive threat hunting.”\n\nA moderator of the CrowdStrike subreddit also said the company was aware of “widespread reports” of blue screen errors on Windows devices across multiple versions of its software. The firm was investigating the cause, the message read.\n\n### Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist\n\n#### Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector.\n\nThe security firm didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMicrosoft started to note problems starting in the early hours of July 19. Its Service Health page notes currently that Microsoft 365 for Consumers is now back up. Enterprise apps, however, are still seeing disruption according to its Service Health Status for its cloud services for business.\n\n“We’re aware of an issue affecting Windows devices due to an update from a third-party software platform. We anticipate a resolution is forthcoming,” a Microsoft spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement.\n\nThe Microsoft spokesperson said that the previous Microsoft 365 service disruption overnight July 18 to 19 was unrelated to the widespread outage triggered by the CrowdStrike update.\n\nThere will be a lot of questions to ask and answer about resilience — or perhaps the lack of it — in cloud services, and namely how one single update could bring so much to a grinding halt around the world.\n\n“In our view, cybersecurity products have to clear a higher bar of reliability and security in customer deployments than other technology products because they are mission critical and actively attacked by adversaries,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a research note Friday. “In some ways, we believe this will reinforce the barrier to entry in the industry and the need for best-in-class update, outage and customer service protocols, ultimately favoring companies with scale.”\n\nAirlines and airports across Germany, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as Australia, China, Japan, India, Singapore and Taiwan are reporting problems with check-in and ticketing systems, resulting in flight delays and ample chaos at airports.\n\nU.S. federal airspace officials announced a nationwide ground stop of air traffic on Friday due to the outages, which might have an affect on the climate, experts told TechCrunch. Others were affected by the outage and the airline chaos in other ways.\n\nIn the U.K., the London Stock Exchange reported disruptions. Several doctors’ offices in the U.K. said on X that the outage had hit the National Health Service’s clinical computer system that contains medical records and is used for scheduling appointments.\n\nAnd in the U.S., some 911 and non-emergency call centers seem to be affected. A post by Alaska State Troopers said many such call centers were “not working correctly across the State of Alaska.”\n\nU.K. news broadcaster Sky News faced trouble broadcasting live this morning due to the outage, the firm’s executive chairman David Rhodes tweeted. The New Zealand Herald reported that banking services in the country were affected by the issue, too, and several Indian news channels said they had problems broadcasting as well.\n\nMany companies’ employees have reported being unable to start their computers due to the issue. The outage came shortly after Microsoft confirmed service problems with its Microsoft 365 apps late on Thursday, which affected several airlines including Delta and United. Microsoft’s services status page says the issues are being resolved.\n\nAnd amid the chaos, misinformation has been spreading, including that the Las Vegas Sphere was displaying a blue screen of death.\n\nBefore CrowdStrike acknowledged its role in the crash, businesses and security experts early on Friday began to point fingers at the company, whose software is used by millions of people across enterprises to manage security both on devices and servers. Experts told TechCrunch that rivals could stand to gain from the debacle, as well.\n\nCrowdStrike counts nearly 60% of Fortune 500 companies and more than half of the Fortune 1,000 among its clients, per its website. Its services are deployed by eight of the top 10 financial services firms and an equal number of leading tech companies. It also has a deep and wide presence in the healthcare and manufacturing sectors, serving six and seven of the top 10 companies in those industries, respectively.\n\nCrowdStrike’s shares were down around 11% when the market closed on Friday, and a market cap of $74.2 billion at the time of this writing.\n\n*Ram Iyer, Ingrid Lunden and Zack Whittaker contributed to this report. *\n\n*This story was originally published at 12:09 a.m. July 19, and was updated to reflect new information.*",

        "content": "Microsoft is retiring one of computing’s most recognizable error messages after nearly four decades. The iconic Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) that has haunted Windows users since the 1980s will be replaced with a streamlined Black Screen of Death as part of the company’s broader initiative to enhance system reliability and user experience.\n\nThis significant change represents Microsoft’s commitment to modernizing Windows 11’s error-handling mechanisms while providing more actionable diagnostic information to both end users and IT administrators.\n\n**Summary**\n1. Microsoft replaces the iconic Blue Screen of Death with a Black Screen of Death in Windows 11.\n2. Black minimalist interface removes blue color, frowning face, and QR code elements.\n3. Stop codes and faulty drivers now display on-screen, eliminating need for crash dump analysis.\n4. Launched with Quick Machine Recovery feature to improve system resilience post-CrowdStrike incident.\n\n\n** Windows Introduces a New Black Screen of Death**\n\nThe Blue Screen of Death has served as Windows’ primary indicator of system crashes for approximately 40 years, becoming an instantly recognizable symbol of computer frustration worldwide.\n\nMicrosoft’s decision to retire the traditional blue interface marks a fundamental shift in how the operating system communicates critical errors to users.\n\nThe Verge reports that the new Black Screen of Death eliminates familiar elements, including the distinctive blue background, frowning face emoticon, and QR code that characterized recent BSOD iterations.\n\nThe redesigned error screen adopts a minimalist black interface that closely resembles the screens displayed during Windows updates.\n\nThis aesthetic choice reflects Microsoft’s broader design philosophy of creating cleaner, more professional-looking system interfaces.\n\nAccording to David Weston, Microsoft’s vice president of enterprise and OS security, this transformation prioritizes clarity and improved information delivery over traditional visual elements.\n\n**Enhanced Error Reporting and Diagnostics**\n\nThe Black Screen of Death introduces significant technical enhancements that address longstanding challenges in Windows error diagnostics.\n\nUnlike previous BSOD implementations, the new error screen will consistently display critical diagnostic information, including stop codes and identification of faulty system drivers, directly on the crash screen.\n\nThis advancement eliminates the need for IT administrators to extract crash dump files and analyze them using specialized debugging tools like WinDbg.\n\nStop codes, which are hexadecimal error identifiers that indicate specific system failures, will be prominently featured alongside driver information.\n\nThis immediate access to diagnostic data represents a substantial improvement in troubleshooting efficiency.\n\nPreviously, determining the root cause of system crashes often required technical expertise and additional software tools to parse memory dump files, creating barriers for less experienced users and increasing resolution times.\n\nMicrosoft plans to implement the Black Screen of Death through a Windows 11 update scheduled for release “later this summer” in 2025.\n\nThis deployment will coincide with the introduction of Quick Machine Recovery, a new feature designed to restore systems that fail to boot properly rapidly.\n\nThe timing of these updates reflects Microsoft’s response to widespread system failures experienced during the CrowdStrike incident, which affected millions of Windows machines globally.\n\nThe Quick Machine Recovery feature represents a proactive approach to system resilience, potentially reducing downtime and minimizing the impact of critical system errors.\n\nThese improvements form part of Microsoft’s comprehensive strategy to enhance Windows stability and provide better tools for both automated recovery and manual intervention when system failures occur.\n\nInvestigate live malware behavior, trace every step of an attack, and make faster, smarter security decisions -> **Try ANY.RUN now**",

        "content": "# Tech outage eases after widespread disruption\n\nJuly 19 (Reuters) - Services from airlines to healthcare, shipping and finance were coming back online on Friday after a mistake in a security software update sparked hours-long global computer systems outages, another incident highlighting the vulnerability of the world's interconnected technologies.\n\nAfter the outage was resolved, companies were dealing with backlogs of delayed and canceled flights and medical appointments, missed orders and other issues that could take days to resolve. Businesses also face questions about how to avoid future blackouts triggered by technology meant to safeguard their systems.\n\nA software update by global cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike (CRWD.O), one of the largest operators in the industry, triggered systems problems that grounded flights, forced broadcasters off air and left customers without access to services such as healthcare or banking. Global shipper FedEx (FDX.N) faced major disruptions and some moderators who police content on Meta's Facebook were hit.\n\nCrowdStrike is not a household name but it is an $83 billion company with more than 20,000 subscribers around the world including Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O). CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said on social media platform X that a defect was found \"in a single content update for Windows hosts\" that affected Microsoft customers.\n\n\"We're deeply sorry for the impact that we've caused to customers, to travelers, to anyone affected by this, including our company,\" Kurtz told NBC News.\n\nCrowdStrike has one of the largest shares of the highly competitive cybersecurity market, leading some industry analysts to question whether control over such operationally critical software should remain with just a handful of companies.\n\nThe outage also raised concerns that many organizations are not well prepared to implement contingency plans when a single point of failure such as an IT system, or a piece of software within it, goes down. But these outages will happen again, experts say, until more contingencies are built into networks and organizations introduce better back-ups.\n\nCrowdStrike shares closed down 11%. Its rivals SentinelOne (S.N) shares closed up 8% and Palo Alto Networks (PANW.O) closed up 2%. Microsoft closed down 0.7%.\n\nThe scale of the outage was massive, but not yet quantifiable because it involved only systems that were running CrowdStrike software, said Ann Johnson, who heads Microsoft's security and compliance business.\n\n\"We have hundreds of engineers right now working directly with CrowdStrike to get customers back online,\" she said.\n\nPresident Joe Bidenwas briefed on the outage, a White House official said. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said it observed hackers using the outage for phishing and other malicious activities.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection said it was experiencing processing delays and working to mitigate issues related to international trade and travel. The Dutch and United Arab Emirates' foreign ministries also reported disruptions.\n\n\"This event is a reminder of how complex and intertwined our global computing systems are and how vulnerable they are,\" said Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson.\n\n\"CrowdStrike and Microsoft will have a lot of work to do to make sure that it won't allow other systems and products to cause this kind of failure in the future,\" he said.\n\nWall Street's main indexes fell on Friday, deepening a sell-off driven by tech stocks and mixed earnings. The Cboe Volatility index (.VIX), known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" hit its highest level since early May, and the dollar climbed as the worldwide cyber outage unnerved investors.\n\n## THOUSANDS OF FLIGHTS CANCELED\n\nAir travel was immediately hit, because carriers depend on smooth scheduling that, when interrupted, can ripple into lengthy delays. Out of more than 110,000 scheduled commercial flights on Friday, 5,000 were canceled globally with more expected, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium.\n\nDelta Air Lines (DAL.N) was one of the hardest hit, with 20% of its flights canceled, according to flight tracking service FlightAware. The U.S. carrier said it expected additional delays and cancelations potentially through the weekend.\n\nAirports from Los Angeles to Singapore, Amsterdam and Berlin said airlines were checking in passengers with handwritten boarding passes, causing delays.\n\nBanks and financial services companies warned customers of disruptions and traders across markets spoke of problems executing transactions. Insurers could face a raft of business interruption claims.\n\nU.S. healthcare providers reported that outages were affecting call centers, patient portals and other operations. Mass General Brigham in Boston said it was treating only urgent cases while Tufts Medical Center warned that patients might experience delays or need to be rescheduled.\n\nIn Britain, booking systems used by doctors were offline, posts on X by medical officials said, while Sky News, one of the country's major broadcasters, was taken off the air.\n\nAs the day progressed, more companies reported a return to normal service, including Spanish airport operator Aena (AENA.MC), U.S. carriers United Airlines (UAL.O) and American Airlines (AAL.O), and Australia's Commonwealth Bank (CBA.AX).\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said system issues appeared to be resolving and transportation would hopefully be back to normal by Saturday.\n\nSign up here.\n\nReporting by Reuters bureaus; Writing by Tomasz Janowski, Emelia Sithole-Matarise, Nick Zieminski, Sayantani Ghosh and Peter Henderson; Editing by David Gaffen, Emelia Sithole, Kirsten Donovan, Matthew Lewis, Anna Driver and Leslie Adler\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is an American cybersecurity technology company based in Austin, Texas. It provides cloud workload protection and endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. CrowdStrike collaborates with companies like Microsoft to deploy tools such as Falcon to protect against hacking and security threats.\n\nOn Friday, July 19, 2024, CrowdStrike released a configuration update for its Falcon Sensor software, installed on Windows PCs to detect intrusions and hacking attempts. While the update was intended to bring minor improvements that customers would have barely noticed, it instead caused significant problems due to a logic error in the update software. Many computers running CrowdStrike services faced repeated reboots and the notorious Blue Screen of Death.\n\n## Impact of the Incident\n\nThe CrowdStrike update incident had a profound impact, affecting nearly 8.5 million Microsoft devices across various user groups.\n\nThe incident caused a significant IT outage that reverberated globally. Critical systems faced disruptions, leading to widespread consequences. Downtime from the outage led to significant financial losses due to halted operations, lost productivity, potential fines, and costs related to breach mitigation. According to Parametric Impact Analysis, Fortune 500 companies lost $5.4 billion in the outage (Parametrix, 2024).\n\nIn addition, trust in CrowdStrike’s reliability was undermined, affecting both the organization’s reputation and client confidence. CrowdStrike, the security company responsible for the update, experienced a sharp decline in its stock value. Shares plummeted by nearly 13% during premarket trading on Friday (McKenna, 2024).\n\nMac and Linux systems did not receive the update and, therefore, are not experiencing these issues.\n\n## What Affected Organizations Could Have Done Better\n\nThis incident underscores the necessity for effective patch management, incident management, and robust business continuity strategies to ensure that organizations are able to restore normal operations after an incident.\n\nAffected organizations that faced restoration challenges struggled due to several key factors:\n\n### 1. Poor Patch Management Practices\n\nIn the CrowdStrike incident, poor patch management practices played a critical role in facilitating the breach. Testing patches in a controlled environment before deployment is crucial to ensure that they do not introduce new issues and are, hence, critical.\n\n### 2. Inadequate Incident Response Plan\n\nWithout a well-defined incident response plan, organizations had delayed and uncoordinated responses, exacerbating the disruption.\n\n### 3. Insufficient BC/DR Preparedness\n\nThe absence of effective Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) measures led to prolonged downtime and operational losses.\n\n### 4. Untrained Staff\n\n**Lack of Training and Awareness:**Inadequate training in incident response resulted in an ineffective response and exacerbated the outage’s impact.**Inability to Implement Mitigation Strategies:**Untrained staff struggled to implement effective mitigation strategies, including system isolation and communication.\n\n## What Organizations Can Do to Prevent Similar Incidents\n\nPreparedness and training are key. Blue team training programs such as the Certified Network Defender (CND), EC-Council Certified Incident Handler (ECIH), and EC-Council Disaster Recovery Professional (EDRP) can help organizations maintain better incident preparedness and manage the technical, administrative, and human aspects of handling such disasters.\n\n### 1. Effective Patch Management\n\nEffective patch management is a critical aspect of maintaining the security and operational continuity of any IT infrastructure. It involves the timely testing and deployment of updates and patches to software and systems to address vulnerabilities, improve performance, and enhance functionality. The workforce must be trained with comprehensive defensive training programs, such as the CND, which equip participants with patch management best practices, helping organizations mitigate security risks, avoid downtime, and ensure compliance with industry regulations.\n\n### 2. Comprehensive Incident Handling and Response\n\nOrganizations must develop structured response plans and incident response strategies. A well-defined incident response plan includes predefined procedures for handling software conflicts and outages. This ensures that the response is swift and coordinated. Timely detection and analysis help contain the damages and achieve faster recovery. EC-Council’s ECIH program equips students with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to effectively prepare for, deal with, and eradicate threats and threat actors in an incident. The program provides skills to build robust incident-handling response frameworks and best practices for handling incidents.\n\n### 3. Proactive Risk Management\n\nProactively assessing potential risks allows organizations to recognize and address them before they escalate into serious issues. Organizations also need to learn to identify and assess risks related to updates and vendor dependencies. Training programs such as the CND and EDRP provide requisite skills to anticipate threats and develop and implement strategies to mitigate or eliminate risks, such as updating security protocols or conducting regular system audits.\n\n### 4. Enhanced BC/DR Planning\n\nEffective Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) planning helps minimize downtime, ensuring that essential business functions can continue or be quickly restored, reducing the impact on operations. Organizations need robust change management processes to assess the impact of updates on critical systems. Maintaining backups and redundant systems ensures continuity even during outages. Regular data backups and failover mechanisms are crucial. EC-Council’s EDRP program provides a strong understanding of business continuity and disaster recovery principles, including conducting business impact analysis, assessing risks, and developing and implementing policies, procedures, and BC/DR plans.\n\n### 5. Security Best Practices\n\nFollowing security guidelines, such as timely patching, network segmentation, and access controls, helps prevent vulnerabilities that could lead to incidents. Implementing security best practices, conducting employee training, and performing mock drills are crucial for preventing cybersecurity incidents. EC-Council’s industry-recognized, accredited, and hands-on training programs can help organizations build a strong skill base and avoid such incidents as CrowdStrike.\n\nThe CrowdStrike incident highlighted how a simple issue such as a faulty update to security software could cause widespread problems. To prevent similar incidents, organizations need to implement robust patch management, comprehensive incident response plans, proactive risk management, enhanced business continuity and disaster recovery strategies, and adhere to security best practices. Training programs such as EC-Council’s Certified Network Defender (CND), Certified Incident Handler (ECIH), and Disaster Recovery Professional (EDRP) can help in maintaining better incident preparedness and managing the technical, administrative, and human aspects of such crises.\n\n## References:\n\nParametrix.

        "content": "### Dive Brief:\n\n- A vulnerability in the common log file system of Microsoft Windows can lead to the blue screen of death, impacting all versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11, researchers from Fortra said Monday.\n- The vulnerability, listed as CVE-2024- 6768, is caused by improper validation of specified quantities of input data, according to a report by Fortra. The vulnerability can result in an unrecoverable inconsistency and trigger a function called KeBugCheckEx, leading to the blue screen.\n- A malicious hacker can exploit the flaw to trigger repeated crashes, disrupting system operations and the potential loss of data, according to Fortra.\n\n### Dive Insight:\n\nFortra originally reported the vulnerability to Microsoft in December, with a proof of concept exploit, according to a timeline provided by Fortra. Microsoft told them on two different occasions their engineers could not reproduce the vulnerability, according to the timeline.\n\n“Microsoft told us that they could not reproduce the issue and closed the case,” Tyler Reguly, associate director of security research at Fortra, said via email.\n\nMicrosoft, however said the research that was shared with them does not rise to the level of a security threat that requires an immediate response.\n\n“We have reviewed this report and have found that it does not meet the bar for immediate servicing under our severity classification guidelines and we will consider it for a future product update,” a Microsoft spokesperson said via email. “The technique described requires an attacker to have already gained code execution capabilities on the target machine and it does not grant elevated permissions.”\n\nMicrosoft said customers should practice good computing habits, which include exercising caution when running programs they do not recognize.\n\nThe vulnerability disclosure comes less than a month after Microsoft was involved in one of the biggest global IT outages in history. A flawed software update in the CrowdStrike Falcon platform led to an outage July 19 involving about 8.5 million Windows devices.\n\nCritical providers, ranging from airlines to hospitals and financial institutions across the globe were impacted when they temporarily faced similar blue screens on their Windows computers.\n\nThere is no indication the vulnerability identified by Fortra played a role in the outage related to the CrowdStrike update.\n\nIn late July, Microsoft also dealt with a separate DDoS attack that impacted Azure and 365 services.\n\nEditor’s note: This story has been updated to include additional details from Fortra and a statement from Microsoft.",

        "content": "# Hezbollah walkie-talkies exploded too, what to know about Israel’s attacks\n\n*A day after the explosion of thousands of pagers, the detonation of walkie-talkies and other devices kills 14 people.*\n\nOne day after thousands of pagers exploded across Lebanon, more explosions of handheld devices, including walkie-talkie radios, mobile phones, laptops and even solar power cells, have killed at least 20 people and injured 450.\n\nReports on Wednesday of several blasts quickly spread on messaging apps with people sharing images of exploded walkie-talkies and residential buildings on fire.\n\n## Recommended Stories\n\nlist of 4 items- list 1 of 4Escalation fears spike as Hezbollah vows retaliation for pager attack\n- list 2 of 4Second wave of blasts hits Lebanon as Israel declares ‘new phase’ of war\n- list 3 of 4Deaths reported as walkie-talkies explode in Lebanon\n- list 4 of 4‘Civilian objects should not be weaponised’: UN chief on Lebanon blasts\n\nOn Tuesday, some 4,000 pagers belonging to Hezbollah members had exploded over the course of an hour. Twelve people were killed and nearly 3,000 injured.\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\n## So was this attack smaller?\n\nWell, yes and no.\n\nWhile fewer devices exploded, they were bigger and have caused more injuries.\n\nFirass Abiad, Lebanon’s health minister, told Al Jazeera that “those who sustained serious injuries were severely affected”.\n\n## Where in Lebanon did the new explosions happen?\n\nInformation is still trickling in, but several blasts were reported in the southern suburbs of Beirut as well as in the southern city of Tyre on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nImages posted on social media showed vehicles on fire and smoke rising from a residential area as reports came in of walkie-talkie radios and even solar cells exploding.\n\nAl Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem witnessed one car explode during a funeral in southern Lebanon.\n\nHe noted that the explosion seemed to come from within the car rather than externally, as would be the case with a drone strike.\n\n\n\nHe described chaos on the streets with ambulances racing to pick up the injured and reports of more explosions coming in and spreading panic.\n\n“Probably we are witnessing another wave, … really concerning given that yesterday’s incident already overwhelmed the whole health sector,” Hashem added.\n\n## What exploded?\n\nThere are reports of several different devices blowing up.\n\nChief among them are walkie-talkie radios, but there was also mention of mobile phones, laptops and even some solar energy systems.\n\nSeveral cars reportedly exploded as well, but it is not clear if those were caused by the car itself exploding or something inside it.\n\n## What are ‘walkie-talkie radios’?\n\nA regular walkie-talkie is a handheld, two-way radio device that allows people to exchange messages with the walkie-talkie base or others holding mobile receivers.\n\nThey are short-range devices and need to stay close to their base to transmit.\n\nThe devices being called walkie-talkie radios are apparently IC-V82s, manufactured by the Japanese company ICOM, which would have a much bigger range than regular walkie-talkies.\n\nThe IC-V82 has not been produced for 10 years, ICOM said after the incidents.\n\n## How do you make walkie-talkie radios explode?\n\nAgain, the details are not clear yet.\n\nSome observers have wondered if Wednesday’s blasts were similar to what happened with the pagers.\n\nWith those, the supply chain might have been infiltrated and the devices loaded with 1 to 3 grammes (0.04 to 0.11oz) of a powerful explosive.\n\nIt seems that at least some Hezbollah members believe the explosions are linked to batteries.\n\nSeveral of them quickly took the batteries out of their radios and tossed them away after one exploded during a funeral in a southern suburb of Beirut, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nPagers use radio transmission and reception as does, of course, a radio.\n\nMost of the impacted devices appeared to be communication systems, but there were also some reports of other devices exploding, like solar panels. At least one such explosion injured a girl.\n\nHezbollah and the Lebanese government have blamed Israel for the explosions. Israel has not commented.\n\n\n\n## Why would Israel do this to Lebanon?\n\nIsrael’s long-term strategy is unclear, but the attacks are a notable escalation against Hezbollah and Lebanon.\n\nAnalysts have long accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of escalating on one front after another to try to avoid facing any repercussions for his security failures and a corruption case he is on trial for.\n\nHis latest has been adding a “new war goal”, namely clearing the northern area by the Lebanese border so Israelis who had to evacuate from there could return.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday evening that the army would divert forces and resources from its near-yearlong war in Gaza to the north.\n\n## How big of a blow is this to Hezbollah?\n\nThe attacks were a big security breach for Hezbollah as well as a potent tool of psychological warfare with some analysts wondering if they have shaken the group’s image domestically.\n\nHezbollah’s communications apparatus appeared to remain operational, according to security and political analyst Elijah Magnier, who said after the first attack that thousands of older pagers were unaffected and the group had alternative secure communications in place.\n\nAs panic set in, people in Lebanon started disposing of their devices or taking them into shops to be checked.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, before the latest explosions, Hezbollah said it had attacked Israeli artillery positions with rockets in the first strike on Israel since the initial attacks, according to Reuters.\n\n## What’s next?\n\n“This attack by Israel is being seen in Lebanon as a terrorist attack because it has fed terror,” Al Jazeera correspondent Imran Khan said from Beirut. “People are scared.”\n\nMagnier said Israel had successfully managed to “create confusion among Hezbollah and in society”.\n\nHe noted the cascading reports and climate of chaos as a sign that Israel’s strategy to wait more than 24 hours before the second detonations had been a successful one.\n\n“This is exactly the objective of Israel – to create such confusion and prepare perhaps for a phase three,” he said.\n\n“We have to wait and see what they are preparing next because this is not the end of it.”",

Analysts say the Kremlin uses so-called hybrid warfare to sow discord, test European defences, and blur the line between war and peace. Russia has denied responsibility for the various unexplained drone sightings, explosions, and killings.\n\nEven as they increase traditional defense spending to deter Moscow, however, Europeans “must also acknowledge that hybrid hostilities with the Kremlin are already underway,” an expert wrote for the Atlantic Council.",

        "content": "# Israel planted explosives in Hezbollah's Taiwan-made pagers, say sources\n\nBEIRUT, Sept 18 (Reuters) - (This Sept. 18 story has been corrected to fix the pager model name to AR-924, not AP924, in paragraph 6)\n\nIsrael's Mossad spy agency planted a small amount of explosives inside 5,000 Taiwan-made pagers ordered by Lebanese group Hezbollah months before Tuesday's detonations, a senior Lebanese security source and another source told Reuters.\n\nSign up here.\n\nThe operation was an unprecedented Hezbollah security breach that saw thousands of pagers detonate across Lebanon, killing nine people and wounding nearly 3,000 others, including the group's fighters and Iran's envoy to Beirut.\n\nIran-backed Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel, whose military declined to comment on the blasts.\n\nThe plot appears to have been many months in the making, several sources told Reuters.\n\nThe senior Lebanese security source said the group had ordered 5,000 beepers made by Taiwan-based Gold Apollo, which several sources say were brought into the country earlier this year.\n\nThe senior Lebanese security source identified a photograph of the model of the pager, an AR-924, which like other pagers wirelessly receive and display text messages but cannot make telephone calls.\n\nHezbollah fighters have been using pagers as a low-tech means of communication in an attempt to evade Israeli location-tracking, two sources familiar with the group's operations told Reuters this year.\n\nBut the senior Lebanese source said the devices had been modified by Israel's spy service \"at the production level.\"\n\n\"The Mossad injected a board inside of the device that has explosive material that receives a code. It's very hard to detect it through any means. Even with any device or scanner,\" the source said.\n\nThe source said 3,000 of the pagers exploded when a coded message was sent to them, simultaneously activating the explosives.\n\nAnother security source told Reuters that up to three grams of explosives were hidden in the new pagers and had gone \"undetected\" by Hezbollah for months.\n\nNeither Israel nor Gold Apollo immediately responded to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nImages of destroyed pagers analyzed by Reuters showed a format and stickers on the back that were consistent with pagers made by Gold Apollo, based in Taipei.\n\nHezbollah was reeling from the attack, which left fighters and others bloodied, hospitalised or dead. One Hezbollah official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the detonation was the group's \"biggest security breach\" since the Gaza conflict between Israel and Hezbollah ally Hamas erupted on Oct. 7.\n\n\"This would easily be the biggest counterintelligence failure that Hezbollah has had in decades,\" said Jonathan Panikoff, the U.S. government's former deputy national intelligence officer on the Middle East.\n\n## BREAK YOUR PHONES, GROUP ORDERED\n\nIn February, Hezbollah drew up a war plan that aimed to address gaps in the group's intelligence infrastructure. Around 170 fighters had already been killed in targeted Israeli strikes on Lebanon, including one senior commander and a top Hamas official in Beirut.\n\nIn a televised speech on Feb. 13, the group's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah sternly warned supporters that their phones were more dangerous than Israeli spies, saying they should break, bury or lock them in an iron box.\n\nInstead, the group opted to distribute pagers to Hezbollah members across the group's various branches - from fighters to medics working in its relief services.\n\nThe explosions maimed many Hezbollah members, according to footage from hospitals reviewed by Reuters. Wounded men had injuries of varying degrees to the face, missing fingers and gaping wounds at the hip where the pagers were likely worn.\n\n\"We really got hit hard,\" said the senior Lebanese security source, who has direct knowledge of the group's probe into the explosions.\n\nThe pager blasts came at a time of mounting concern about tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, which have been engaged in cross-border warfare since the Gaza conflict erupted last October.\n\nWhile the war in Gaza has been Israel's main focus since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas-led gunmen, the precarious situation along Israel's northern border with Lebanon has fueled fears of a regional conflict that could drag in the United States and Iran.\n\nA missile barrage by Hezbollah the day after Oct. 7 opened the latest phase of conflict and since then there have been daily exchanges of rockets, artillery fire and missiles, with Israeli jets striking deep into Lebanese territory.\n\nHezbollah has said it does not seek a wider war but would fight if Israel launched one.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday that the window was closing for a diplomatic solution to the standoff with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement in southern Lebanon.\n\nStill, experts said they did not see the pager blasts as a sign that an Israeli ground offensive was imminent.\n\nInstead, it was a sign of Israeli intelligence's apparently deep penetration of Hezbollah.\n\n\"It demonstrates Israel's ability to infiltrate its adversaries in a remarkably dramatic way,\" said Paul Pillar, a 28-year veteran of the U.S. intelligence community, mainly at the CIA.\n\nAdditional reporting by Phil Stewart and Matt Spetalnick in Washington.

        "content": "An international investigation must be established to hold perpetrators of the simultaneous mass explosions targeting electronic devices across Lebanon and Syria, which injured more than 2,931 people and killed at least 37, including at least four civilians, accountable, said Amnesty International ahead of a UN Security Council meeting today to discuss the explosions.\n\nShould Israel be determined to be responsible, then these attacks took place in the context of an ongoing armed conflict. The evidence indicates that those who planned and carried out these attacks could not verify who else in the immediate vicinity of the devices would be harmed at the time of the explosion, or even whether only fighters had been given the pagers and radios. Therefore, the attacks were carried out indiscriminately, would be unlawful under international humanitarian law and should be investigated as war crimes. The attacks also violated at a minimum the right to life under international human rights law, which continues to apply in situations of armed conflict, and likely other human rights, depending on the various impacts of the attack on the Lebanese population and their daily lives.\n\nAlthough the Israeli government has not officially commented on the attacks, on 18 September, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant declared that a “new era” of war with Lebanon is beginning and praised the “excellent achievements” of the Israeli security and intelligence, a statement which has been interpreted as an implicit acknowledgement of Israel’s role in the attacks. The Lebanese authorities and US officials have also indicated they believe Israel orchestrated the attacks.\n\nThe mass explosions across Lebanon and Syria in recent days bear the hallmarks of a sinister dystopian nightmare. Using hidden explosive devices concealed within everyday telecommunications devices to wage deadly attacks on such a scale is unprecedented.\n\nAya Majzoub, Deputy MENA Director\n\n“The mass explosions across Lebanon and Syria in recent days bear the hallmarks of a sinister dystopian nightmare. Using hidden explosive devices concealed within everyday telecommunications devices to wage deadly attacks on such a scale is unprecedented. Even if the attacks intended to target military objectives, detonating thousands of devices simultaneously without being able to determine their exact location or whose possession they were in at the time of the attack demonstrates a flagrant disregard for the right to life and for the laws of armed conflict,” said Aya Majzoub, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa.\n\n“International humanitarian law prohibits indiscriminate attacks – meaning attacks that fail to distinguish between civilians and military targets. It also prohibits the use of the type of booby-traps that appear to have been used in these attacks.\n\n“The UN Security Council should take all the measures at its disposal to ensure protection of civilians and avoid more needless suffering. An international investigation must urgently be set up to establish the facts and bring the perpetrators to justice.”\n\nExplosions took place in supermarkets, cars, residential streets and other busy public areas causing traumatic injuries, spreading widespread terror and panic across Lebanon and overwhelming a healthcare sector already impacted by an acute economic crisis.\n\nAmnesty International spoke to eight witnesses, the Lebanese Minister of Health, two medical doctors, two psychologists and a security source. The organization’s Crisis Evidence Lab analyzed 19 photos and videos from the explosions and their aftermath. Amnesty International’s Secretariat has written to the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office and Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting their responses to the allegations that Israel was responsible for the attacks.\n\n**Applicable international law**\n\nShould Israel be determined to be responsible, then these attacks took place in the context of an ongoing armed conflict. As such, their lawfulness must be assessed on the basis of international humanitarian law, as well as applicable international human rights law, which continues to apply in situations of armed conflict. This applies in particular to the right to life, as confirmed by the UN Human Rights Committee.\n\nThe reliance on routine tools of civilian daily life for the explosions, the impossibility of the perpetrators to have known the identity of all those who received the devices, who would be using them and who would be near them – all of these factors indicate that the attacks were indiscriminate and therefore unlawful. As such, they should be investigated as war crimes.\n\nInternational humanitarian law also prohibits the use of booby-traps or other devices which employ a device “in the form of apparently harmless portable objects which are specifically designed and constructed to contain explosive material”, according to Amended Protocol II to the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.\n\nCustomary international law further prohibits acts of violence primarily aimed at spreading terror among the civilian population.\n\nThe International Court of Justice, the Human Rights Committee, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights have all confirmed that human rights treaty obligations apply in principle to the conduct of a state outside its territory.\n\n**Attacks**\n\nBetween 3:30 pm and 4:30 pm on 17 September 2024, hidden explosive devices within thousands of pagers across Lebanon detonated, killing at least 12, including a nine-year-old girl, an 11-year-old boy and two medics, and injuring at least 2,323. The next day, just before 5 pm on 18 September, similar explosive devices within scores of hand-held “walkie-talkies” exploded across Lebanon, killing at least 25 people and injuring at least 608.\n\nThese attacks have taken place amid an escalation in hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah over the past 11 months.\n\nAs of 9 September 2024, Israeli attacks on south Lebanon and the Bekaa have killed at least 137 civilians, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health and the United Nations. Over 113,000 people have been displaced from south Lebanon due to the ongoing hostilities. According to the Israeli authorities, Hezbollah and other armed groups have fired projectiles at northern Israel and killed 14 civilians. 12 children were killed on 27 July in an attack on Majdal Shams in the occupied Golan Heights. Israel blamed Hezbollah, but Hezbollah has denied responsibility. Around 60,000 residents of northern Israel have been evacuated since 8 October. Attacks which do not distinguish between civilians and military targets are indiscriminate. When such attacks kill or injure civilians they constitute war crimes.\n\n**Pager explosions, 17 September:**\n\nWitnesses described to Amnesty International how the attacks caused confusion and fear among the civilian population. A resident of the southern city of Sour (Tyre), said she saw people running as blood flowed on the street. Everyone she spoke to had a different explanation for the events. A waiter told her that a man ordered a coffee and then shot himself in his car. Another person told her someone’s car battery exploded. A third said that something exploded in one man’s hands. A few minutes later, a man told her that pagers are exploding. “It was a state of panic in every sense of the word. I still cannot comprehend it. It’s as if we are watching an episode of Black Mirror (a dystopian British TV series), these things aren’t supposed to happen,” she said.\n\nAnother witness who was shopping in the southern Beirut suburb of Borj al-Barajne when she saw women and children screaming and running, described the scenes as apocalyptic. “People were running all around me, but my legs couldn’t move,” she said. She later saw young men lying on the ground and dozens of ambulances arriving.\n\nPeople were running all around me, but my legs couldn’t move\n\nA witness to a pager explosion in Beirut\n\nAmnesty International’s Evidence Lab analyzed 12 videos showing the pagers exploding in crowded civilian areas, such as residential streets and grocery stores, as well as in people’s homes. A verified video of the skyline of Beirut show large smoke plums over at least 10 locations in residential areas.\n\nLebanon’s Minister of Health, Dr. Firas Abiad, described the attacks as “the epitome of indiscriminate attacks” adding many caused “life-changing injuries”.\n\nOne witness confirmed to Amnesty International media reports stating the pagers beeped before detonating causing some people to bring them up to their faces to check the screens. A mechanic in Sour described how a friend’s pager started beeping: “He took it in his hands, I was looking at it, and it said ERROR. I turned around to get my cigarettes, and I was still right next to him, and then the pager exploded. He lost his hand and both his eyes.”\n\nEvidence available to Amnesty International indicates that the pagers were not only distributed to Hezbollah fighters but were likely also distributed to employees of Hezbollah institutions that work in civilian capacities. Hezbollah said in a statement issued on 17 September that the pagers belonged to “employees of various Hezbollah units and institutions.” The Health Minister told the organization that at least four healthcare workers sustained serious injuries in the attacks. Two of them, nurse Atta al-Dirani, and a medic at the Rasoul Azam Hospital. Mohammad Bilal Kanj, died as a result of their wounds.\n\nAmnesty International also spoke to the employee of a non-profit who said that two of its workers, responsible for organizing community outreach programs in the southern suburbs of Beirut and in the south, owned these pagers and were injured when they exploded.\n\nDr. Georges Ghanem, Chief Medical Officer of the Lebanese American University Medical Center, said the hospital was flooded with injured patients requiring the same expertise: “Everybody had injuries to their hands, lots of amputations, and eye problems that are non-salvageable…One of those who died was an 11-year-old boy. He had major brain injuries. He was with his father, who had the pager.”\n\nDr. Salah Zeineddine, the Chief Medical Officer of the American University of Beirut Hospital also said all the patients admitted had sustained multiple injuries including to the face, hands and lower abdomen and waistline injuries.\n\nAn ophthalmologist at Mount Lebanon University Hospital in Beirut told the media that between 60-70% of the patients he treated had to have at least one eye removed. “Some of the patients, we had to remove both eyes. It kills me. In my past 25 years of practice, I’ve never removed as many eyes as I did yesterday [referring to 17 September],” he said.\n\nAmnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab analyzed images of the destroyed pagers, and said they were consistent with AR-924 Gold Apollo Rugged pagers. A security source told Amnesty International that Hezbollah had ordered around 5,000 of these pagers earlier this year.\n\nIt is likely that the attack was carried out using a small remotely controlled explosive device hidden in a modified batch of pagers. The blasts in the videos are consistent with the detonation of the small amount of explosives that could be contained within such small electronic devices.\n\n**Walkie-Talkie explosions, 18 September:**\n\nOn 18 September, just before 5pm, more electronic devices simultaneously detonated across the country, with reports of explosions in the southern suburbs of Beirut, cities and towns in southern Lebanon, and in the Bekaa.\n\nVideo verified by Amnesty International’s Evidence Lab show large smoke plumes, indicating that the explosions resulting from those devices were bigger than those caused by the pagers that detonated, setting entire residential apartments and shops on fire. The Lebanese Communications\n\nMinistry said that the devices that exploded are IC-V82 handheld radios, or walkie-talkies, made by a Japanese firm, but that the model had been discontinued and the devices were not officially licensed. Images of the exploded devices reviewed by the Evidence Lab were consistent with IC-V82 walkie-talkies. A security source told Reuters that these handheld radios were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago, around the same time as the pagers.\n\nI put my phone at home, I didn’t open a laptop, I became paranoid. Anything that connects me to the Internet, I don’t want to touch\n\nResident in Beirut\n\nAt least two explosions were heard as hundreds of men, women, children and older persons gathered for the funeral of four individuals, including a child and a medic, killed by the pager detonations the day before. Amnesty International spoke with three witnesses who were at the funeral in Ghobeiry, in the southern suburbs of Beirut, who described people running and screaming. One witness told Amnesty International that someone in the crowd was yelling: “it exploded in his hand!”\n\nThe Lebanese Civil Defense said its personnel worked to extinguish fires that broke out in 60 homes and shops, 15 cars and dozens of motorcycles following the explosion of the walkie-talkies.\n\nThese attacks have compounded the fear and trauma of a Lebanese population already facing the looming threat of an escalation of war with Israel.\n\nJoseph el-Khoury, a consultant psychiatrist, said the attacks could have a long-lasting impact: “These attacks terrorized the city…and is a continuation of the [Israeli jet] flyovers and sonic booms… Whoever did that did not care about the mental health of an entire population.”\n\nOne resident told Amnesty International: “I put my phone at home, I didn’t open a laptop, I became paranoid. Anything that connects me to the Internet, I don’t want to touch. I also don’t want a motorcycle to pass by me, I don’t want people next to me. Because if they have a device, I am gone with them.”",

        "content": "# Did exploding pagers attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon violate international law?\n\nLONDON — The series of explosions that rocked Lebanon this week, killing dozens and wounding thousands, has prompted heated debate among legal experts on international humanitarian law.\n\nMany, but not all, of the pagers and walkie-talkies that unexpectedly blew up over two days across Lebanon and in some neighboring countries were in the possession of Hezbollah fighters, functionaries or allies.\n\nThe group is designated as a terrorist organization by several nations, including the United States, but many of its members and supporters operate in civilian areas across Lebanon — and some of the explosions left innocent bystanders, including children, injured or dead.\n\nIsrael has not officially acknowledged playing a role in the explosions. But a U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR that Israel notified Washington that it was responsible for Tuesday’s attacks.\n\nSeveral international treaties and protocols to which Israel is a signatory could render these actions by a state such as Israel illegal under international humanitarian law, scholars say.\n\nOne particular focus is Article 7(2) of the Amended Protocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons*, *which was added to an international law focused on the use of conventional weapons in 1996. Both Israel and Lebanon have agreed to it.\n\nIt prohibits the use of booby traps, which Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch, defines as \"objects that civilians are likely to be attracted to or are associated with normal civilian daily use.\"\n\nIn a statement, Fakih said the use of \"an explosive device whose exact location could not be reliably known would be unlawfully indiscriminate, using a means of attack that could not be directed at a specific military target and as a result would strike military targets and civilians without distinction.\" Human Rights Watch has called for an immediate and impartial investigation into the incidents.\n\n\"Israel is a party to that Protocol,\" wrote Richard Moyes, a director at Article 36, an advocacy group that focuses on international law in the context of civilian casualties in conflict zones. In a message to NPR about the rule, commonly known as Article 7(2), he wrote of the attacks: \"I think there are lots of other legal problems here under the general rules of war — but it feels like it is a direct breach of this rule.\"\n\nBrian Finucane, a former legal adviser on the use of military force at the U.S. State Department, told NPR's *Morning Edition* on Friday that information obtained since the explosions \"implicate[s] Israel in these attacks, and also suggests that these attacks violate this prohibition on the use of booby traps or other devices in this fashion.\"\n\nFinucane pointed out in a post on the website Just Security that the U.S. Defense Department also references that same article from those amended 1996 protocols in its own \"Law of War Manual,\" with an oft-cited example of communications headsets that Italian military units booby-trapped with explosives after retreating during World War II.\n\nFinucane, now a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group, told NPR that broader internationally recognized and ratified laws of war contained requirements that parties to a conflict take \"feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians\" and \"take into consideration proportionality when launching attacks.\"\n\nBut he said at this stage it was complicated to reach a conclusion about proportionality and targeting just yet, without more facts being known about the attacks. \"Were they limited to fighters in Hezbollah? Were they distributed more widely within the organization? Were they distributed to its civilian population?\" he said, repeating questions for which there are no current answers. \"It's also very difficult to know what Israel officials who launched the attack knew about the locations of people carrying these pagers, if anything.\"\n\nA group of United Nations human rights experts called the simultaneous explosions “terrifying” violations of international law. “To the extent that international humanitarian law applies, at the time of the attacks there was no way of knowing who possessed each device and who was nearby,” the experts said. “Simultaneous attacks by thousands of devices would inevitably violate humanitarian law, by failing to verify each target, and distinguish between protected civilians and those who could potentially be attacked for taking a direct part in hostilities.\"\n\nAnd Jessica Peake, an international law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law, told The Intercept that \"detonating pagers in people’s pockets without any knowledge of where those are, in that moment, is a pretty evident indiscriminate attack,” and that the attacks were — in her view — \"quite blatant, both violations of both proportionality and indiscriminate attacks.”\n\nHowever, other legal scholars and academics argue the attacks were entirely defensible under international law.\n\n\"The operation passes all fundamental laws of war necessity, proportionality, and distinction,\" John Spencer, chair of Urban Warfare Studies at the Modern War Institute at West Point, told *Newsweek*. \"It was a very precise sabotage of an enemy piece of equipment used for military purposes.\"\n\nWilliam H. Boothby, a retired air commodore in the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force, wrote for the Lieber Institute at West Point that it was \"probably reasonable for those planning and conducting the operation to assume that pagers issued for military purposes would be in the possession of their military users at the time of detonation.\"\n\nBut, as former deputy director of Royal Air Force Legal Services, Boothby said concerns about the manner in which the attacks were targeted would center on \"whether adequate consideration was given to the incidental injury and damage to be expected from these explosions,\" since those responsible for detonating the devices could not have been certain of the circumstances in which so many different explosions would occur.\n\nThe attacks have drawn political condemnation by some U.S. lawmakers for their perceived violation of international law, including Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. She posted on X that the explosions, which she attributed to Israel, had occurred in across public spaces, killing and injuring innocent civilians.\n\n\"This attack clearly and unequivocally violates international humanitarian law and undermines U.S. efforts to prevent a wider conflict,\" she wrote.",

        "content": "# Italy to extradite Ukrainian Nord Stream sabotage suspect to Germany\n\n*Former Ukrainian officer Serhii Kuznietsov faces charges in Germany of collusion to cause an explosion, sabotage and destruction of infrastructure.*\n\nItaly’s top court has approved the extradition to Germany of a Ukrainian man suspected of coordinating the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines between Russia and Europe in 2022.\n\nThe suspect, Serhii Kuznietsov, 49, has denied being part of a cell of saboteurs accused of placing explosives on the underwater pipelines in the Baltic Sea, severing much of Russia’s gas transfers to Europe and prompting supply shortages on the continent.\n\n## Recommended Stories\n\nlist of 4 items- list 1 of 4Solving the Nord Stream mystery\n- list 2 of 4Polish court will not extradite Ukrainian to Germany over Nord Stream blasts\n- list 3 of 4Ukrainian man arrested in Italy over Nord Stream pipeline blasts\n- list 4 of 4Ukrainian diver with alleged links to Nord Stream attack detained in Poland\n\nAfter Italy originally blocked Kuznietsov’s extradition last month over an issue with a German arrest warrant, Italy’s Supreme Court of Cassation approved the transfer on Wednesday.\n\nKuznietsov “will therefore be surrendered to Germany within the next few days”, his lawyer Nicola Canestrini said.\n\nThe suspect, a former officer in the Ukrainian military, has denied any role in the attack and has fought attempts to transfer him to Germany since he was detained on a European arrest warrant in the Italian town of Rimini, where he was vacationing with his family, in August.\n\n\n\n“However great the disappointment, I remain confident in an acquittal after the full trial in Germany,” Canestrini said in a statement.\n\nLast month, a court in Poland ruled against handing over another Ukrainian suspect wanted by Germany in connection with the pipeline explosions and ordered his immediate release from detention.\n\nKuznietsov faces charges in Germany of collusion to cause an explosion, sabotage and destruction of important structures.\n\nGerman prosecutors said he used forged identity documents to charter a yacht that departed from the German city of Rostock to carry out the attack near the Danish island of Bornholm on September 26, 2022.\n\nAccording to extradition documents, prosecutors said Kuznietsov organised and carried out the detonation of at least four bombs containing 14kg to 27kg (31lb to 62lb) of explosives at a depth of 70 to 80 metres (230ft to 263ft).\n\n\n\nThe explosions damaged both the Nord Stream 1 and the Nord Stream 2 pipelines so severely that no gas could be transported through them. In total, four ruptures were discovered in the pipelines after the attack.\n\nKuznietsov says he was a member of the Ukrainian armed forces and in Ukraine at the time of the incident, a claim his defence team has said would give him “functional immunity” under international law.\n\nEarlier this month, members of the European Parliament (MEPs) sent a letter to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressing concern about Kuznietsov’s extradition.\n\n“The destruction of the pipelines dealt a significant blow to Russia’s war machine in its ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine,” the MEPs wrote.\n\n“From the standpoint of international law, actions undertaken in defence against such aggression, including the neutralisation of the enemy’s military infrastructure, fall within the lawful conduct of a just war,” they wrote.\n\n“We, therefore, urge the Italian government to suspend any steps toward extradition until the guarantees of functional immunity and state responsibility are thoroughly and independently assessed,” they added.\n\nKuznietsov, who faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty by a German court, has been held in a high security jail in Italy since his arrest and at one point staged a hunger strike to protest against his prison conditions.\n\nSix other suspects in the case remain at large.",

The detonation \"of an explosive device destroyed the railway track,\" the prime minister added.\n\nTusk did not name any suspects or a potential motive for the alleged sabotage.

This route is also crucially important for delivering aid to Ukraine.\"\n\n\"We will catch the perpetrators, regardless of who their backers are,\" Tusk added.\n\nPolish Interior Minister Marcin Kierwinski echoed Tusk's assessment in a post to social media.\n\nAs Poland downs drones amid Russia strike, NATO braces for new era on eastern front\n\n\"There is no doubt that we are dealing with an act of sabotage,\" Kierwinski wrote. \"Another section of this strategic railway route, where the tracks were damaged, is also being investigated.\"\n\nPolish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said in a post to X that units under the command of the Defense Ministry had been deployed to assist in the investigation.\n\nMilitary units will inspect some 75 miles of track running to the Polish town of Hrubieszow along the border with Ukraine, Kosiniak-Kamysz said.\n\nPolish police said the damage was discovered during an inspection on Sunday morning after a train driver reported irregularities.\n\nShortly after the damage was discovered, Tusk said it was possible that sabotage was to blame.\n\nUkraine and France ink deal for jets and missile defenses, Paris says",

        "content": "# NATO country confirm railway line explosion was sabotage as WW3 fears mount\n\n## Poland's Prime Minister has confirmed that an explosion which damaged a railway in the country was sabotage, as fears of a Russian attack on a NATO country grow\n\nPoland's Prime Minister has confirmed an explosion that damaged a key railway line in the country was deliberate sabotage.\n\nDonald Tusk wrote on X: \"Unfortunately, the worst fears have been confirmed. On the Warsaw-Lublin route (Mika village), an act of sabotage has occurred. The explosion of an explosive device destroyed the railway track. Emergency services and the prosecutor's office are working at the scene. On the same route, closer to Lublin, damage has also been identified.\", reports the Express.\n\nMr Tusk stopped short of identifying those responsible for the sabotage, though he has previously pointed the finger at Russia in similar cases, with Moscow consistently denying any involvement. Poland's deputy interior minister confirmed investigators are examining the sabotage.\n\nHe said: \"After all, Russia is not so powerful that every arson attack or similar situation was provoked by Russia. However, in no case should this be ruled out or ignored.\"\n\nLocal police reported on Sunday that a train operator flagged damage on the line in central Poland. The railway line reportedly runs to Poland's border with Ukraine, according to RMF24.\n\nThe \"disruption\" occurred in Łyczyn, Garwolin County, Masovian Voivodeship, close to PKP Mika station. This line links Warsaw with the Dorohusk border crossing, the outlet reported.\n\nThe route serves Mazovian Railways, along with freight trains traveling to Lublin, Chelm, and points beyond into Ukraine. Mr Tusk stated on Sunday: \"Regarding the destruction of a section of the tracks on the Lublin-Warsaw route, I am in constant contact with the Minister of Internal Affairs.\n\n\"It is not ruled out that we are dealing with an act of sabotage. No one was injured. The relevant services are carrying out their activities.\"\n\nPolish officials have previously indicated that the nation's support for Ukraine and provision of military aid makes it vulnerable to Russian sabotage operations, allegations which Moscow has denied.",

        "content": "# Kremlin confirms explosion at Russia's Crimean Bridge after Ukraine's sabotage, claims 'no damage'\n\nAn explosion recently occurred at the Crimean Bridge, but caused \"no damage,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed on June 4, accusing Ukraine of attempted attacks on Russia's infrastructure.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for the explosion that rocked the bridge in the early hours of June 3. The agency said that more than a ton of explosives in TNT equivalent damaged the underwater supports of the structure.\n\n\"There indeed was an explosion. There was no damage, the bridge continues to function,\" Peskov said, according to the Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti. \"Kyiv continues in its attempts to attack infrastructure facilities.\"\n\nConstructed after Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, the Crimean Bridge — also known as the Kerch Bridge — is a critical supply and transport route for Russian forces to the occupied Ukrainian territories. It connects the occupied peninsula to Russia's Krasnodar Krai via the Kerch Strait.\n\nThe Russian state media reported on June 3 that a \"Ukrainian intelligence agent\" who had constructed a bomb on \"orders from Kyiv\" had been detained by Russia's FSB.\n\nIn comments later on June 3, Dmytro Pletenchuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Navy, said the \"key and most complex\" part of the bridge had been damaged in the attack.\n\nThe operation, which follows the SBU's mass drone strike against Russia's strategic aviation on June 1, was personally supervised by the agency's chief, Vasyl Maliuk.\n\nThe bridge suffered significant damage during two previous Ukrainian attacks in October 2022 and July 2023, though neither managed to take the bridge out of commission.",

        "content": "# UN appeals for restraint after further devices explode across Lebanon\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres has called for an end to the escalation in violence in the Middle East amid reports of a fresh wave of electronic device detonations in Lebanon which caused further deaths and injuries.\n\nInternational media reported that walkie-talkies used by members of the Hezbollah militant group blew up on Wednesday, a day after hundreds of pagers across the country exploded simultaneously.\n\nMr. Guterres was deeply alarmed by reports that a large number of communication devices exploded in Lebanon and Syria over the past two days, his Spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nAt least 11 people were killed, including children – and thousands more injured.\n\n**Stop the fighting, restore stability**\n\n“The Secretary-General urges all concerned actors to exercise maximum restraint to avert any further escalation,” the statement said.\n\nHe also called for the parties to recommit to the full implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and immediately return to a cessation of hostilities to restore stability.\n\nAdopted in August 2006, the resolution aimed at ending the war that erupted that year between Israel and Hezbollah, on Lebanese soil. It calls for an end to hostilities, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, and the establishment of a demilitarized zone.\n\nThe statement concluded by saying **the UN “supports all diplomatic and political efforts to end the violence that threatens to engulf the region.”**\n\n**De-escalation ‘more crucial than ever’: UN rights chief**\n\nThe device detonations are occurring against the backdrop of the war in Gaza and attacks last year in Lebanon, the Syrian Golan Heights and Iran, linked to the conflict.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, also issued a statement deploring the widespread simultaneous explosions and stressing the need for de-escalation.\n\n“At this extremely volatile time, I appeal to all States with influence in the region and beyond to take immediate measures to avert further widening of the current conflicts - enough of the daily horrors, enough of the suffering,” he said.\n\n“It is high time leaders stepped up in defence of the rights of all people to live in peace and security. **The protection of civilians must be the paramount priority**. De-escalation is today more crucial than ever.”\n\n**Call for investigation**\n\nContinuing, Mr. Turk said “simultaneous targeting of thousands of individuals, whether civilians or members of armed groups, **without knowledge as to who was in possession of the targeted devices, their location and their surroundings at the time of the attack, violates international human rights law** and, to the extent applicable, international humanitarian law.”\n\nHe called for an independent, thorough and transparent investigation and for those who ordered and carried out the attacks to be held to account.\n\nThe UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon also warned against the danger of escalation.\n\n\"Pained by casualties inflicted today due to more explosions of devices, I can only reiterate my appeal for restraint. Further escalatory actions risk devastating consequences,\" Jeanine Hennis-Plaschaert wrote in a post on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe envoy also acknowledged the efforts of medical teams \"working under enormous stress to save lives and treat the wounded.\"",

        "content": "Israel carried out part of its device attack targeting Hezbollah by concealing explosives inside the batteries of pagers brought into Lebanon, according to two high-ranking Lebanese security officials, who said the technology was so advanced that it was virtually undetectable.\n\nLebanese security officials watched a series of controlled explosions of some of the weaponized pagers, as investigations into who manufactured the wireless communication devices and how they made their way into Hezbollah’s pockets continued.\n\nThe pagers used in the controlled explosions were switched off at the time of the attack on September 17, which meant they did not receive the message that caused the compromised devices to detonate. The officials had a front-row seat to see just how catastrophic the blasts would have been to those carrying the devices and others around them.\n\nThousands of explosions struck Hezbollah members last week, targeting their pagers on Tuesday, and then walkie-talkies a day later. In all, the blasts killed at least 37 people, including some children, and injured nearly 3,000, according to Lebanese health authorities, many of them civilian bystanders. The attack blindsided the group, which had opted for analogue technologies after forgoing cell phones to avoid Israeli infiltration.\n\nIsrael has not commented directly on the attacks, but CNN has learned that the explosions were the result of a joint operation by Israel’s intelligence service, Mossad, and the Israeli military.** **Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, tacitly acknowledged his country’s role the day after the pager attack, praising “excellent achievements, together with the Shin Bet, together with Mossad.” Both Lebanon and Hezbollah have blamed Israel for the attacks.\n\nOne of the Lebanese security sources told CNN the way in which the explosive material had been hidden inside the pagers’ batteries was so sophisticated that it could not be detected, but did not elaborate further as to what sort of checks the devices had gone through before entering the country.\n\nThe second high-ranking security source said that he had examined one of the compromised pagers and witnessed its controlled explosion. He told CNN that the explosive material was “laced” inside the pager’s lithium battery and virtually undetectable. He added that he had never seen anything like it.\n\nAn improvised explosive device has five key components: A power source, an initiator, a detonator, an explosive charge and a case to put it all in. Sean Moorhouse, a former British Army officer and explosive ordnance disposal expert, said that only a detonator and explosive charge would have been needed to weaponize the pagers, which already have the other three components.\n\n“It had to be done in such a way to make it invisible,” Moorhouse said, adding that one way to do that could have been modifying the battery itself – implanting an electronic detonator and small explosive charge inside of its metal casing, which would have made it impossible to detect with imaging, for example X-rays.\n\nOther experts who reviewed footage of the blasts also said that explosive devices appeared to have been hidden in the pagers, suggesting a sophisticated supply chain attack involving a state actor.\n\nThat tallied with initial assessments by Lebanese authorities. Lebanon’s mission to the United Nations said in a letter sent to the UN Security Council last Friday that a preliminary investigation found that the communications devices were implanted with explosives before arriving in the country, tampered with “in a professional way” by “foreign entities.”\n\nLebanese authorities determined that the devices were detonated by sending electronic messages to them, according to the letter, which was seen by CNN. Israel was responsible for carrying out the attacks, which detonated thousands of devices simultaneously, Lebanon’s UN mission said.\n\n## Mysterious supply chain stretches from Taiwan to Hungary\n\nMultiple photos from the aftermath of last week’s attacks in Lebanon show remnants of the exploded pagers – also known as beepers – that were consistent with a model made by a Taiwanese firm, Gold Apollo, and fragments of walkie-talkies identified as the make of a Japanese firm, ICOM.\n\nLebanese authorities have said that the devices used in the attacks were Gold Apollo Rugged Pager AR-924 pagers and ICOM IC-V82 walkie-talkies. Both Gold Apollo and ICOM have distanced themselves from the compromised devices.\n\nICOM said that the IC-V82 model was discontinued a decade ago, and it could not determine whether the devices targeted in Lebanon were counterfeit or shipped from its company. Counterfeit versions are widely available for purchase on e-commerce websites, like Alibaba. Lebanon’s communications ministry said the IC-V82 radios used in the attacks were not supplied by a recognized agent, were not officially licensed and had not been vetted by the security services.\n\nInternational investigative efforts have largely zeroed in on the Gold Apollo AR-924 pagers – tracing the model’s licensing and manufacturing from Taiwan to apparent shell companies to try to establish how the Israeli operation may have been carried out. The New York Times reported, citing three intelligence officers briefed on the operation, that Israel had set up at least three shell companies to disguise the identities of those making the pagers – Israeli intelligence officers.\n\nThe chairman and founder of Taiwan-based Gold Apollo, Hsu Ching-kuang, was questioned by Taiwanese prosecutors last Thursday before being released.\n\nA day earlier, at the nondescript offices of Gold Apollo on the outskirts of the Taiwanese capital, Hsu, speaking to CNN and other media, vehemently denied having made the pagers bearing his company’s brand name, claiming instead that they were manufactured by a Hungarian firm, BAC Consulting.\n\nHsu told CNN he had entered into a licensing agreement with the Budapest-registered company, signing over “sole responsibility” for the production and sale of the AR-924 model. A person called Teresa was one of his contacts for the deal, he said.\n\nTeresa Wu, a former Gold Apollo employee, was also seen leaving the prosecutors’ office in New Taipei City last Thursday evening, according to reporting by Reuters and local media staked out outside. Prosecutors in Taiwan currently list Hsu and Wu as witnesses, two senior officials in Taiwan told CNN.\n\nA person with knowledge of Gold Apollo told CNN that Wu had left the company a couple of years ago, and that they understood she had started working for BAC Consulting. CNN has reached out to Wu for comment.\n\nWu set up a company called Apollo Systems Ltd in April of this year, listed under a Taipei address that appears to be a co-working space, according to corporate records. It is not clear if Wu was operating for BAC Consulting in Taipei under her new company name, Apollo Systems Ltd.\n\nApollo Systems Ltd lists its website address as “www.apollosystemshk.com,” according to a database maintained by Taiwan’s International Trade Administration. The Apollo Systems HK website – which was shut down by its administrator after the attack – said that the business had a manufacturing and sales hub in Taipei City and a logistics office in Hong Kong. When CNN visited the Hong Kong address, there was no sign of the company.\n\nIn December 2022 and February 2023, a YouTube channel for Apollo Systems HK uploaded two videos of the Gold Apollo AR-924 pager touting its “high-capacity lithium rechargeable battery” and other features. On its YouTube channel and website, Apollo Systems HK said that it had acquired the “sole distribution rights” to Gold Apollo pager systems. It also listed the AR-924 model as a product available for purchase.\n\nThe two senior Taiwanese officials who spoke with CNN said that there was no record of Gold Apollo manufacturing any AR-924 pagers in Taiwan. The officials also confirmed that Gold Apollo only manufactured pagers with AA batteries in Taiwan, not lithium batteries as found in the devices used in the attack and examined by Lebanese officials, according to CNN’s sources.\n\nCustoms records in Taiwan, cited by the officials, showed that Gold Apollo shipped more than 20,000 pagers from Taiwan to the United States in the first eight months of 2024. More than 5,000 pagers were shipped to Hong Kong, while more than 3,000 pagers were shipped to Australia.\n\nThe Taiwanese officials said they had also checked the order history and the source of raw components for Gold Apollo pagers, adding that pager manufacturing was tightly controlled in Taiwan and that devices undergo regular inspections.\n\nThe Taiwanese prosecutors’ office is reviewing documents it obtained from Gold Apollo’s office. In a statement last Thursday, the prosecutors’ office said that there had “been no evidence found so far to suggest any involvements (sic) of Taiwanese nationals in the explosive terror attack.”\n\nInvestigations into the supply chain are also ongoing in Europe, where authorities are probing the Hungarian company, BAC Consulting, and another firm linked to Bulgaria and Norway, for any connections to the pager attack targeting Hezbollah.\n\nCNN has attempted to reach BAC Consulting at its registered address, which is located in a residential area of Budapest. Last Wednesday, a receptionist working at the building said that BAC Consulting rented a space at the address but that no representative had ever physically been there.\n\nCNN has also reached out to BAC Consulting’s chief executive, Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono, but has yet to receive a response. NBC News reported that Bársony-Arcidiacono had confirmed to the news outlet in a phone call that her company worked with Gold Apollo, but said, “I don’t make the pagers. I am just the intermediate.” ** **\n\nThere is no record of Gold Apollo exporting any pagers to Hungary in 2023 or 2024, the two Taiwanese officials said, citing custom records in Taiwan. In 2022, the company exported about 200 pagers to Hungary, they added.\n\nHungarian intelligence services have interviewed Bársony-Arcidiacono several times as part of their investigation into BAC Consulting but have not found any evidence that the pagers used in the attack were manufactured in the country, the government’s press office said in a statement. “The results have clearly established that the so-called ‘beepers’ were never present on Hungarian soil, and no Hungarian company or expert was involved in their production or modification,” it said.\n\nBulgarian authorities said they were investigating Norta Global Ltd after Hungarian media reported last week that the Sofia-based company was involved in the sale of the pagers to Hezbollah. Bulgaria’s national security agency DANS said that no pagers used in the attack were “imported, exported or manufactured in Bulgaria,” and that Norta Global Ltd had not carried out terrorist financing, or traded with anyone subject to sanctions. Bulgaria’s caretaker Prime Minister Dimitar Glavchev told reporters last Friday that the company under investigation was “a cash flow, mailbox-type of firm,” and that its director “acted by proxy.”\n\nAccording to a report by Dezső András, a journalist with Hungarian news outlet Telex, Norta Global Ltd transferred more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) to BAC Consulting in several instalments between March 2023 and June 2024, money that was later sent by BAC in various payments to Gold Apollo, Apollo Systems Ltd and an unnamed Hong Kong firm. The report added that customs data from October 2022 showed that Apollo Systems Ltd. had sent one shipment to Hungary: A package containing just one pager.\n\nNorta Global Ltd was founded in April 2022 by Rinson Jose, a Norwegian national, according to Bulgarian business registration documents. CNN has tried to contact Jose on multiple platforms for comment, but he has not yet responded. Norway’s security police have started a preliminary probe into the company’s reported links to the pagers, according to a police attorney at the Norwegian Police Security Service.\n\n## Hezbollah digs into devices’ supply chain\n\nHezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah, in an address last Thursday, said that the militant group had formed multiple internal investigative committees to get to the bottom of what happened, vowing a “reckoning” for those responsible.\n\n“Regarding the explosions, we have reached an almost certain conclusion, but we still need some time to confirm it,” Nasrallah said. “This entire matter is under thorough investigation and review, from the company that sold the devices, to manufacturing, transportation, arrival in Lebanon, and distribution, all the way to the moment of the explosion.”\n\nHe added that while the apparent goal of the attack was to kill as many senior Hezbollah officials as possible, much of the leadership had been unaffected because they were carrying older pager models, suggesting that the form of communication has been used by the group for some time.\n\n“The new ones were sent elsewhere,” he said, apparently referring to the batch of pagers a Lebanese security source told CNN was purchased by Hezbollah in recent months.\n\n“These attacks represent a new development in warfare, where communication tools become weapons, simultaneously exploding across marketplaces, on street corners, and in homes as daily life unfolds,” UN human rights chief Volker Türk told the Security Council last Friday. “Authorities have reportedly dismantled unexploded devices in universities, banks, and hospitals.”\n\nHe added that simultaneously targeting thousands of people – whether civilians or armed forces – without the knowledge of who is in possession of the targeted devices and their surroundings at the time of the attack, violates international human rights law.\n\nIran’s delegate to the UN said that Israel had intended to kill at least 5,000 civilians, but some devices were deactivated or not distributed. The delegate said that Israel had again “crossed a red line,” noting that Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon was among those injured.\n\nSenior UN officials warned that the devices attack marked a turning point, calling for de-escalation and a ceasefire in Gaza before a war consumes the whole of the Middle East. Others said that the technology apparently used marked “dangerous new territory” in the world of warfare.\n\n*CNN’s Pallabi Munsi, Katie Polglase, Tara John, Eyad Kourdi and Avery Schmitz contributed to this report.*",

        "content": "Supported by\n\n# How Israel Built a Modern-Day Trojan Horse: Exploding Pagers\n\nThe Israeli government did not tamper with the Hezbollah devices that exploded, defense and intelligence officials say. It manufactured them as part of an elaborate ruse.\n\n*Follow along with the latest **Middle East updates** as Israel-Hezbollah tensions escalate.*\n\nThe pagers began beeping just after 3:30 in the afternoon in Lebanon on Tuesday, alerting Hezbollah operatives to a message from their leadership in a chorus of chimes, melodies, and buzzes.\n\nBut it wasn’t the militants’ leaders. The pagers had been sent by Hezbollah’s archenemy, and within seconds the alerts were followed by the sounds of explosions and cries of pain and panic in streets, shops and homes across Lebanon.\n\nPowered by just a few ounces of an explosive compound concealed within the devices, the blasts sent grown men flying off motorcycles and slamming into walls, according to witnesses and video footage. People out shopping fell to the ground, writhing in agony, smoke snaking from their pockets.\n\nMohammed Awada, 52, and his son were driving by one man whose pager exploded, he said. “My son went crazy and started to scream when he saw the man’s hand flying away from him,” he said.\n\nBy the end of the day, at least a dozen people were dead and more than 2,700 were wounded, many of them maimed. And the following day, 20 more people were killed and hundreds wounded when walkie-talkies in Lebanon also began mysteriously exploding. Some of the dead and wounded were Hezbollah members, but others were not; four of the dead were children.\n\nIsrael has neither confirmed nor denied any role in the explosions, but 12 current and former defense and intelligence officials who were briefed on the attack say the Israelis were behind it, describing the operation as complex and long in the making. They spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity, given the sensitivity of the subject.\n\nThe booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkies were the latest salvo in the decades-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which is based across the border in Lebanon. The tensions escalated after the war began in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIranian-backed groups like Hezbollah have long been vulnerable to Israeli attacks using sophisticated technologies. In 2020, for example, Israel assassinated Iran’s top nuclear scientist using an A.I.-assisted robot controlled remotely via satellite. Israel has also used hacking to stymie Iranian nuclear development.\n\nIn Lebanon, as Israel picked off senior Hezbollah commandos with targeted assassinations, their leader came to a conclusion: If Israel was going high-tech, Hezbollah would go low. It was clear, a distressed Hezbollah chief, Hassan Nasrallah, said, that Israel was using cellphone networks to pinpoint the locations of his operatives.\n\n“You ask me where is the agent,” Mr. Nasrallah told his followers in a publicly televised address in February. “I tell you that the phone in your hands, in your wife’s hands, and in your children’s hands is the agent.”\n\nThen he issued a plea.\n\n“Bury it,” Mr. Nasrallah said. “Put it in an iron box and lock it.”\n\nHe had been pushing for years for Hezbollah to invest instead in pagers, which for all their limited capabilities could receive data without giving away a user’s location or other compromising information, according to American intelligence assessments.\n\nIsraeli intelligence officials saw an opportunity.\n\nEven before Mr. Nasrallah decided to expand pager usage, Israel had put into motion a plan to establish a shell company that would pose as an international pager producer.\n\nBy all appearances, B.A.C. Consulting was a Hungary-based company that was under contract to produce the devices on behalf of a Taiwanese company, Gold Apollo. In fact, it was part of an Israeli front, according to three intelligence officers briefed on the operation. They said at least two other shell companies were created as well to mask the real identities of the people creating the pagers: Israeli intelligence officers.\n\nB.A.C. did take on ordinary clients, for which it produced a range of ordinary pagers. But the only client that really mattered was Hezbollah, and its pagers were far from ordinary. Produced separately, they contained batteries laced with the explosive PETN, according to the three intelligence officers.\n\nThe pagers began shipping to Lebanon in the summer of 2022 in small numbers, but production was quickly ramped up after Mr. Nasrallah denounced cellphones.\n\nSome of Mr. Nasrallah’s fears were spurred by reports from allies that Israel had acquired new means to hack into phones, activating microphones and cameras remotely to spy on their owners. According to three intelligence officials, Israel had invested millions in developing the technology, and word spread among Hezbollah and its allies that no cellphone communication — even encrypted messaging apps — was safe anymore.\n\nNot only did Mr. Nasrallah ban cellphones from meetings of Hezbollah operatives, he ordered that the details of Hezbollah movements and plans never be communicated over cellphones, said three intelligence officials. Hezbollah officers, he ordered, had to carry pagers at all times, and in the event of war, pagers would be used to tell fighters where to go.\n\nOver the summer, shipments of the pagers to Lebanon increased, with thousands arriving in the country and being distributed among Hezbollah officers and their allies, according to two American intelligence officials.\n\nTo Hezbollah, they were a defensive measure, but in Israel, intelligence officers referred to the pagers as “buttons” that could be pushed when the time seemed ripe.\n\nThat moment, it appears, came this week.\n\nSpeaking to his security cabinet on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would do whatever was necessary to enable more than 70,000 Israelis driven away by the fighting with Hezbollah to return home, according to reports in Israeli news outlets. Those residents, he said, could not return without “a fundamental change in the security situation in the north,” according to a statement from the prime minister’s office.\n\nOn Tuesday, the order was given to activate the pagers.\n\nTo set off the explosions, according to three intelligence and defense officials, Israel triggered the pagers to beep and sent a message to them in Arabic that appeared as though it had come from Hezbollah’s senior leadership.\n\nSeconds later, Lebanon was in chaos.\n\nWith so many people wounded, ambulances crawled through the streets, and hospitals were soon overwhelmed. Hezbollah said at least eight of its fighters were killed, but noncombatants were also drawn into the fray.\n\nIn Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, in the village of Saraain, one young girl, Fatima Abdullah, had just come home from her first day of fourth grade when she heard her father’s pager begin to beep, her aunt said. She picked up the device to bring it to him and was holding it when it exploded, killing her. Fatima was 9.\n\nOn Wednesday, as thousands gathered in Beirut’s southern suburbs to attend an outdoor funeral for four people killed in the blasts, chaos erupted anew: There was another explosion.\n\nAmid the acrid smoke, panicked mourners stampeded for the streets, seeking shelter in the lobbies of nearby buildings. Many were afraid that their phone, or the phone of a person standing next to them in the crowd, was about to explode.\n\n“Turn off your phone!” some shouted. “Take out the battery!” Soon a voice on a loudspeaker at the funeral urged everyone to do this.\n\nFor the Lebanese, the second wave of explosions was confirmation of the lesson from the day before: They now live in a world in which the most common of communication devices can be transformed into instruments of death.\n\nOne woman, Um Ibrahim, stopped a reporter in the middle of the confusion and begged to use a cellphone to call her children. Her hands shaking, she dialed a number and then screamed a directive:\n\n“Turn off your phones now!”\n\nLiam Stack and Euan Ward contributed reporting.\n\nSheera Frenkel is a reporter based in the San Francisco Bay Area, covering the ways technology impacts everyday lives with a focus on social media companies, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, Telegram and WhatsApp.\n\nRonen Bergman is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, based in Tel Aviv.

Hezbollah said 16 members were killed Wednesday, but it didn’t elaborate on the circumstances.\n\nDiscontinued models: Lebanon’s communications ministry said the walkie-talkie devices that exploded were a discontinued model made by the Japanese firm ICOM. The IC-V82 radios were not supplied by a recognized agent, were not officially licensed and had not been vetted by the security services, the ministry said. The firm said that the model was discontinued a decade ago, and it could not determine whether they were counterfeit or shipped from its company.\n\n“New era” of war: Israel, which refused to comment on the explosions, was behind the attacks, CNN has learned.

In the first of those calls, Gallant notified Austin that Israel was going to carry out an operation in Lebanon but gave no details on what the operation would entail.\n\nThe White House reiterated Wednesday that the US was not involved in the series of attacks in Lebanon.\n\nThe US learned about the operation’s details from reports of exploding Hezbollah pagers a short time later.\n\nAfter declining to comment on Tuesday’s pager explosions, Gallant appeared to reference the attacks during a visit Wednesday to the Ramat-David Air Force base in northern Israel.\n\nGallant praised the “excellent achievements” of the Israel Defense Forces, together with the country’s security agency, the Shin Bet, and its intelligence agency, Mossad.\n\nGallant’s comment is the first time an Israeli official has tacitly acknowledged Israel’s role in the twin attacks.\n\nLink Copied!\n\nJapanese firm investigating whether its models were used in walkie-talkie explosions\n\nFrom CNN's Manveena Suri\n\nThe sales office for Japanese walkie-talkie maker ICOM in the city of Osaka, Japan, on September 19.\n\nAtish Patel/AFP/Getty Images\n\nJapanese firm ICOM said it was investigating reports that its walkie-talkies were used in the explosions Wednesday in Lebanon, which killed at least 20 people and injured more than 450.\n\nThe company said it would release information as it becomes available.\n\nThe walkie-talkies that exploded on Wednesday were a discontinued model made by the Japanese firm, according to Lebanon’s communications ministry.\n\nThe IC-V82 radios were not supplied by a recognized agent, were not officially licensed and had not been vetted by the security services, the ministry said.\n\nThe company’s website says the IC-V82 has been discontinued, and almost all models in current circulation are counterfeit.\n\nPhotos shared on social media Wednesday alongside claims they show some of the exploded devices bear markings consistent with the IC-V82, a CNN analysis found.\n\nLink Copied!\n\nAnalysis: Takedown of Hezbollah comms signals possible Israeli military offensive\n\nFrom CNN's Will Ripley\n\nIsrael has severely disrupted Hezbollah’s communications network, possibly paving the way for an imminent military offensive in Lebanon, says CNN intelligence and security analyst Bob Baer.\n\nThis week’s attacks rendered Hezbollah unable to coordinate operations effectively, giving Israel a significant strategic advantage in their conflict, according to the former CIA operative.\n\nBaer noted that recent comments by Israel’s defense minister indicate a shift in focus towards Hezbollah, with Israel “pivoting north” after concentrating efforts on Gaza. He said this escalation could lead to an invasion or a widespread bombardment of Lebanon.\n\nBaer described Israel’s breach of Hezbollah’s supply and communication network as a “great defeat” for the group. This tactical achievement has crippled Hezbollah’s ability to mobilize forces, coordinate attacks, and manage logistics.\n\n“The fact that Israel got into their supply network is unprecedented,” Baer remarked, highlighting the disruption of Hezbollah’s use of walkie-talkies as particularly damaging because Hezbollah relies on them to call in fire coordinates, move ammunition, and communicate in real-time.\n\nThis leaves Hezbollah vulnerable if Israel moves forward with its military plans.\n\nBaer, who has tracked Hezbollah for years, expressed astonishment at the precision and scale of the Israeli operation.\n\nBaer said that the operation reflects Israel’s remarkable technical capabilities and emphasized that Hezbollah has long been known for its disciplined and secure communications, making Israel’s breakthrough even more significant.\n\nHe also suggested that the operation serves as a warning to other hostile actors in the region. Israel’s ability to penetrate Hezbollah’s communication network could signal to countries like Syria, Egypt, and Jordan that their systems may be vulnerable to similar infiltration.\n\nLink Copied!\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry denies it was informed ahead of Lebanon's exploding pager attack\n\nFrom CNN's Wayne Chang in New Taipei City\n\nTaiwan's Ministry Spokesman Sun Li-fang speaks during the Taipei Aerospace and Defence Technology Exhibition at the Nangang Exhibition Center in Taipei, on September 13, 2023.\n\nSam Yeh/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTaiwan’s defense ministry denied it was informed beforehand of any connection between the use of Taiwanese-branded pagers and the deadly attack in Lebanon on Tuesday targeting Hezbollah members.\n\nCNN has reported that Tuesday’s pager explosion attacks, which have heightened tensions in a region already on edge, was a joint operation between Israel’s intelligence service, the Mossad, and the Israeli military.\n\nIsrael has tacitly acknowledged its role in the shock operation, which also saw dozens of walkie-talkies explode across Lebanon, as it said a “new era” of war was beginning.\n\nDamaged products identified in images following the wave of deadly pager explosions Tuesday appeared to show the labels of Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo.\n\nWhen asked whether Israel had informed Taiwan in advance of the attack, Taiwan’s Defense Minister Wellington Koo flatly responded: “Impossible.”\n\nDefense ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang said Wednesday that Taiwan was “not involved in any international cooperation outside of this region that is sort of a provocative nature.”\n\nHe said the ministry would not speculate on who manufactured or modified the pagers.\n\nGold Apollo founder Hsu Ching-kuang denied making the pagers bearing its brand name used in the attack – later pointing, without evidence, to the Budapest-registered BAC Consulting firm.\n\nHungarian authorities denied Gold Apollo’s suggestion, saying that BAC Consulting “is a trading intermediary” with no manufacturing sites in the country.\n\nThe various allegations raise further questions as to who manufactured the devices and just how they made their way into Hezbollah’s pockets.\n\nLink Copied!\n\nHezbollah says 16 members were killed Wednesday, but it doesn't elaborate on the circumstances\n\nFrom CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq\n\nHezbollah announced the death of 16 members on Wednesday, one of the deadliest days for the group since the Israel-Hamas war started on October 7.\n\nThe Iran-backed militant group did not give details on the circumstances of the deaths, but said most were from towns in the south of Lebanon.\n\nAmong those who died was a 16-year-old boy, it said.\n\nThe announcement came after walkie-talkie explosions across Lebanon on Wednesday killed at least 20 people, according to the country’s health ministry. It also came as the Israeli military announced it had struck several Hezbollah “infrastructure sites” in southern Lebanon.\n\nLink Copied!\n\nIran airlifts 95 injured people from Lebanon for urgent medical treatment\n\nFrom CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali\n\nNinety-five people injured in this week’s device explosions in Lebanon are being transferred to Iran for further treatment, Iran’s state news agency IRNA said Wednesday, citing Pirhossein Koulivand, head of the Iranian Red Crescent Society.\n\nThe Iranian Red Crescent Society said it dispatched a team on Wednesday following Tuesday’s deadly pager explosions in Lebanon. Later on Wednesday, walkie-talkie explosions in Lebanon killed at least 20 people.\n\nVideos posted on Iranian semi-official outlets show individuals being transferred by stretchers and taken onboard a plane, their heads and eyes wrapped in bandages.\n\nIran accused Israel of carrying out a “terrorist act” and “genocide” after pagers — some owned by Hezbollah members — blew up nearly simultaneously on Tuesday in an unprecedented attack. CNN has learned that Israel was behind Tuesday’s attacks, though Israeli officials have not commented on either day’s attacks publicly.\n\nLink Copied!\n\nIsraeli military says it struck several Hezbollah \"infrastructure sites\" in southern Lebanon\n\nFrom CNN’s Mohammed Tawfeeq\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Wednesday it struck several Hezbollah “infrastructure sites” in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe Israeli military “struck a Hezbollah launcher” as well as “infrastructure sites in the areas of Halta, Kfarkela, Odaisseh, and Chama in southern Lebanon,” the IDF said in a statement.\n\nThe strikes came after “approximately 20 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon” into the country’s northern-most territory, known as the Upper Galilee, the IDF added.\n\nThe IDF said it had intercepted “some of the projectiles,” and no injuries were reported.\n\nHezbollah claimed to have attacked several Israeli military sites in northern Israel with rockets throughout Wednesday. The Iran-backed militant group described those attacks as being in support of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThe group also announced the deaths of at least 11 members on Wednesday but did not give details on the circumstances.\n\nThe post was updated with the latest information on the Hezbollah death toll.\n\nLink Copied!\n\nWalkie-talkie devices that exploded are discontinued Japanese models, Lebanon’s communications ministry says\n\nFrom CNN’s Avery Schmitz, Hamdi Alkhshali and Gianluca Mezzofiore\n\nExploded walkie-talkies in Lebanon on September 18.\n\nObtained by CNN\n\nLebanon’s communications ministry said the walkie-talkie devices that exploded on Wednesday were a discontinued model made by the Japanese firm ICOM.\n\nThe IC-V82 radios were not supplied by a recognized agent, were not officially licensed and had not been vetted by the security services, the ministry said.\n\nICOM has not responded to a CNN’s request for comment.

        "content": "# First pagers, now walkie-talkies explode in Lebanon. Northeastern expert explains why the supply chain is an easy target in war\n\n*This report is part of ongoing coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. Visit **our dedicated page** for more on this topic.*\n\nA second wave of wireless devices — including walkie-talkies and handheld radios — exploded across Lebanon on Wednesday, killing at least 15 people and injuring more than 450.\n\nThe attacks come a day after thousands of pagers owned by members of the militant group Hezbollah exploded across parts of Lebanon and Syria. According to published reports, those devices had been modified with explosions by Israeli spy organization Mossad at the “production level.”\n\nGold Apollo, the Taiwanese company that Hezbollah bought the pagers from, has distanced itself from the attacks — noting that the pagers were made by a Hungarian manufacturer that used Gold Apollo’s branding as part of a licensing deal.\n\nMeanwhile, Hungarian authorities denied that claim, saying the Budapest-registered company “is a trading intermediary” with no manufacturing sites in the country.\n\nShawn Bhimani, a Northeastern University professor of supply chain and information management, says this type of warfare — in which components are modified somewhere along the supply chain — has been a method of attack for decades.\n\n“This isn’t something new,” Bhimani says. “In other wars, this was a key way for different militaries to hurt each other.”\n\nHe used the Falkland Islands War, a 10-week land war between the United Kingdom and Argentina in 1982, as an example.\n\n“The Argentinian government didn’t want to relinquish control, so they bought missiles to protect the Falkland Islands,” he says. “The British government intercepted the missiles on the way to Argentina and made them inoperable so they couldn’t actually attack the British ships when they came.\n\n“So if the news that we are hearing is true — that Israel did this — it wouldn’t be something new,” he adds. “It would just be a continuation of a strategy that has existed in war for the better part of a century.”\n\nThere are many points along the supply chain where these types of interceptions may happen, Bhimani explains.\n\n“First of all you have all the subcomponents that came into the ultimate assembly,” he says. “It could have happened at the subcomponent level. If that was the case, it could have happened even before the final pagers were produced.”\n\nOnce the pagers were made and were en route to Lebanon, they would likely make multiple stops along the way, Bhimani says.\n\n“It would have third-party logistics providers who are shipping the product from the point of manufacturing to the final destination,” he says.\n\nBecause these products change so many hands throughout their journey — whether they are delivered via ship, plane or truck — there are many opportunities for them to be mishandled by a third party, Bhimani explains.\n\nTracing exactly where a disruption like this may have occurred in the supply chain may be difficult to pinpoint because military operations tend to cover their supply chain movements out of public view, he says.\n\n“If a company shipped a product, for example from supplytrace.org,” Bhimani says, “we can trace where it came from. But if a military ships a product, those records are not public and it makes it much more difficult for an interested party to do a full trace unless they are able to get the shipping records at each leg of the journey though each tier of the supply chain.”",

        "content": "# The US bunker-buster bomb that could destroy Iran’s Fordo nuclear facility\n\n## The GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb weighs 13,600 kilograms, and only B-2 stealth bombers are configured to carry it\n\nBANGKOK (AP) — If the US decides to support Israel more directly in its attack on Iran, one option for Washington would be to provide the “bunker-buster” bombs believed necessary to significantly damage the Fordo nuclear fuel enrichment plant, built deeply into a mountain.\n\nSuch a bomb would have to be dropped from an American aircraft, which could have wide-ranging ramifications, including jeopardizing any chance of Iran engaging in Trump’s desired talks on its nuclear program. Israeli officials have also suggested that there are other options for it to attack Fordo as it seeks to destroy Iran’s nuclear capabilities.\n\nBut aside from a commando attack on the ground or a nuclear strike, the bunker buster bomb seems the most likely option.\n\n### What is the bunker-buster bomb?\n\n“Bunker buster” is a broad term used to describe bombs that are designed to penetrate deep below the surface before exploding. In this case, it refers to the latest GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb in the American arsenal. The roughly 30,000 pound (13,600 kilogram) precision-guided bomb is designed to attack deeply buried and hardened bunkers and tunnels, according to the US Air Force.\n\nIt’s believed to be able to penetrate about 200 feet (61 meters) below the surface before exploding, and the bombs can be dropped one after another, effectively drilling deeper and deeper with each successive blast.\n\nThe bomb carries a conventional warhead, but the International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed that Iran is producing highly enriched uranium at Fordo, raising the possibility that nuclear material could be released into the area if the GBU-57 A/B were used to hit the facility.\n\nHowever, Israeli strikes at another Iranian nuclear site, Natanz, on a centrifuge site have caused contamination only at the site itself, not the surrounding area, the IAEA has said.\n\n### How tough a target is Fordo?\n\nFordo is Iran’s second nuclear enrichment facility after Natanz, its main facility. So far, Israeli strikes aren’t known to have damaged Natanz’s underground enrichment hall, nor have the Israelis targeted tunnels the Iranians are digging nearby.\n\nFordo is smaller than Natanz, and is built into the side of a mountain near the city of Qom, about 60 miles (95 kilometers) southwest of Tehran. Construction is believed to have started around 2006 and it first became operational in 2009 — the same year Tehran publicly acknowledged its existence.\n\nIn addition to being an estimated 80 meters (260 feet) under rock and soil, the site is reportedly protected by Iranian and Russian surface-to-air missile systems. Those air defenses, however, likely have already been struck in the Israeli campaign.\n\nStill, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the goal of attacking Iran was to eliminate its missile and nuclear program, which he described as an existential threat to Israel, and officials have said Fordo was part of that plan.\n\n“This entire operation… really has to be completed with the elimination of Fordo,” Yechiel Leiter, Israel’s ambassador to the US, told Fox News on Friday.\n\n### Why does the US need to be involved?\n\nIn theory, the GBU-57 A/B could be dropped by any bomber capable of carrying the weight, but at the moment the US has only configured and programed its B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to deliver the bomb, according to the Air Force.\n\nThe B-2 is only flown by the Air Force and is produced by Northrop Grumman.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer, the B-2 can carry a payload of 40,000 pounds (18,000 kilograms) but the US Air Force has said it has successfully tested the B-2 loaded with two GBU-57 A/B bunker busters — a total weight of some 60,000 pounds (27,200 kilograms).\n\nThe strategic long-range heavy bomber has a range of about 7,000 miles (11,000 kilometers) without refueling and 11,500 miles (18,500 kilometers) with one refueling, and can reach any point in the world within hours, according to Northrop Grumman.\n\nWhether the US would get involved is another matter.\n\nAt the G7 meeting in Canada, Trump was asked what it would take for Washington to become involved militarily and he said: “I don’t want to talk about that.”\n\nIn a weekend interview with ABC News, Israeli Ambassador Leiter was asked about the possibility of the US helping attack Fordo, and he emphasized Israel has only asked the US for defensive help.\n\n“We have a number of contingencies… which will enable us to deal with Fordo,” he said.\n\n“Not everything is a matter of, you know, taking to the skies and bombing from afar.”\n\nIn this season of DocuNation, you can stream** six** **outstanding** **Israeli** **documentaries** with English subtitles and then join a **live online discussion** with the filmmakers.

        "content": "US President Donald Trump authorised the operation, codenamed Operation Midnight Hammer, aiming to “completely eliminate Iran’s nuclear capabilities,” as he later declared. Trump confirmed the outcome on Truth Social, posting: “We have completed our very successful attack… All planes are safely on their way home.”\n\nGeneral Dan Caine, who briefed reporters the following morning, confirmed that more than 125 American aircraft participated.\n\nThe mission, called “Operation Midnight Hammer”, involved decoys and deception, and met with no Iranian resistance, Hegseth and Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a Pentagon news conference.\n\n“This mission was not and has not been about regime change,” Hegseth added.\n\nCaine said the goal of the operation — destroying nuclear sites in Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan — had been achieved.\n\n“Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,” Caine said.\n\n**Also Read:**Countdown to WWIII? Will Iran’s response to US strikes spark the first Nuclear-age war?\n\n## Inside Operation Midnight Hammer\n\nThe strike was conducted with intense secrecy. Bombers took off from the United States late Friday, flying more than 18 hours with minimal communications. To ensure surprise, a decoy formation flew westward into the Pacific, while the actual strike package quietly moved east.General Caine said the US used 75 precision-guided weapons, including 14 GBU-57 “bunker buster” bombs, each weighing 13,000kg. These bombs are specifically designed to penetrate hardened underground targets — such as Fordow — which is buried deep within a mountain.\n\n“Last night, on President Trump's orders, US Central Command conducted a precision strike… It was an incredible and overwhelming success,” Hegseth said.\n\nSubmarine-launched Tomahawk missiles hit surface infrastructure targets in Isfahan just before the bombers dropped their payloads. The assault took place between 6:40 p.m. and 7:05 p.m. Eastern Time — around 2 a.m. local time in Iran.\n\nNo US aircraft were shot at during the mission, and Iran’s surface-to-air systems reportedly failed to detect the incoming bombers.\n\n**Also Read:**US defence secretary hails ‘bold & brilliant’ Operation Midnight Hammer on Iran: All you need to know\n\n## “We will defend ourselves”: Dan Caine\n\nGeneral Caine added, “We are currently unaware of any shots fired at the US strike package on the way in.” He emphasised that the mission was not directed at Iranian troops or civilians, only nuclear infrastructure.The operation, he said, was carried out with “exceptional skill and discipline” and praised the coordination across domains — including space, cyber, and naval forces.\n\n“This type of integration is exactly what our joint force does better than anyone else in the world,” said Caine.\n\n## Strategic Targets: Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan\n\nThe operation targeted three key locations—Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan—all central to Iran’s uranium enrichment programme. The Fordow facility, built deep into a mountainside and considered Iran’s most fortified site, was the primary target.According to Fox News, quoting US sources briefed by Trump himself, between five and six GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs were used. These so-called “bunker busters” were designed to breach hundreds of feet of rock and reinforced concrete. “Fordow is gone,” Trump declared after the mission.\n\nIn addition, 30 Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched from US Navy submarines positioned around 640 kilometres offshore. These missiles hit Natanz and Isfahan, two other facilities integral to Iran’s nuclear operations.\n\n**Also Read:**To hit Fordow is to hit Iran’s nuclear nerve; Here’s why\n\n## The Arsenal: GBU-57s stealth bombers and sub-launched missiles\n\nThe GBU-57s used in the strike are designed for one purpose—to destroy heavily fortified underground targets. Weighing up to 30,000 pounds, they can penetrate up to 200 metres of concrete before detonating.Meanwhile, Tomahawk cruise missiles—launched from platforms including Virginia and Los Angeles class submarines—delivered a second wave of destruction. These missiles have a range of 2,500 kilometres and are guided by advanced GPS and terrain mapping systems, with a precision margin under ten metres.\n\nThe airstrike was carried out by at least three B-2 Spirit bombers, each with a payload capacity of 23,000 kilograms and equipped with stealth technology to avoid radar detection. The bombers were supported by dozens of refuelling tankers and electronic warfare aircraft.\n\n## Buildup and deployment: A show of force\n\nIn the days before the attack, the US reinforced its military footprint across the region. This included the deployment of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, Air Force F-16, F-22, and F-35 fighters, and a significant naval presence.Open-source intelligence confirmed that eight KC-135 Stratotankers were dispatched from Oklahoma to support the B-2 mission. These refuelled bombers departing from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri—signalling the largest B-2 operation in US history and the longest since 2001.\n\n**Also Read:**After US strike, Iran’s ‘all-out war’ warning puts US forces in Bahrain on edge: What comes next?\n\n## No ceasefire, just “total victory”\n\nSpeaking after the attack, Trump stated: “We’re not looking for a ceasefire. We’re looking for total and complete victory. I repeat, you know what the victory is: no nuclear weapons.”The statement was echoed by Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, who said the strike had been “an incredible and overwhelming success” and that “we had devastated the Iranian nuclear programme.”\n\nIran has confirmed the strikes on all three sites but claimed the facilities had been evacuated in advance. State media described the operation as a “barbaric violation” of international law. Tehran has vowed retaliation.\n\nWithin hours of the US strike, Iran launched missiles at Israeli cities including Tel Aviv and Haifa, injuring at least 86 people. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Trump had “betrayed” the American people by starting another Middle East war.\n\nMeanwhile, world leaders have weighed in. UN Secretary General António Guterres called it a “dangerous escalation.” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged Iran to return to talks. Russia’s Dmitry Medvedev accused Trump of seeking a new war under the guise of peace.\n\n**Also Read:**US strikes Iran’s nuclear sites: Vice President JD Vance says war is with weapons programme, not people\n\n## Diplomatic fallout and future options\n\nThe strike has drawn sharp political divisions in Washington. While Republicans like Ted Cruz praised the operation, Democrats including Bernie Sanders called it “grossly unconstitutional.”With the nuclear sites now severely damaged, analysts say Iran faces three choices: escalate and risk wider war, retaliate later when US readiness drops, or enter negotiations. Whether diplomacy can still play a role remains uncertain.\n\nAs Trump warned, “Remember, there are many targets left.”\n\nThe strike came just days after Trump had given Iran a two-week deadline for talks. In the end, the strike came just two days later. Trump also reportedly rejected calls to target Iran’s Supreme Leader, instead choosing to focus solely on nuclear infrastructure.\n\nRepublican leaders mostly supported the strike. Senator Ted Cruz “commended” the President. But Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Trump ally, objected, saying “this is not our fight.”\n\nDemocrats pushed back harder. Senate leader Hakeem Jeffries said Trump risked “entanglement in a potentially disastrous war.” Senator Bernie Sanders called the strikes “grossly unconstitutional”, accusing Trump of bypassing Congress to start a new conflict.\n\nDespite Trump’s call for peace, the US military remains on high alert. The Pentagon has moved additional naval forces into the region, including aircraft carriers and missile-defence destroyers.

        "content": "##### September 20, 2024 | Flash Brief\n\n# Top Hezbollah Commander and Radwan Force Leaders Eliminated in Israeli Air Strike on Beirut\n\n###### September 20, 2024 | Flash Brief\n\n#### Top Hezbollah Commander and Radwan Force Leaders Eliminated in Israeli Air Strike on Beirut\n\n**Latest Developments**\n\nAn Israeli air strike on Beirut on September 20 eliminated Hezbollah’s top military commander, Ibrahim Aqil, and 10 other senior commanders belonging to the Iran-backed terrorist organization. Aqil’s death was confirmed by both the Israel Defense Forces and two “security sources in Lebanon” who spoke to the Reuters news agency. The strike came at the close of a week that plunged Hezbollah into disarray after thousands of pagers and hand-held devices carried by the group’s operatives detonated without warning on September 17 and 18.\n\nAqil was the second member of Hezbollah’s highest body, the Jihad Council, to be killed following an Israeli strike on the same area in July that eliminated his immediate predecessor, Fuad Shukr. According to the IDF, Aqil and the top brass of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force had been meeting beneath a residential building the Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold, when the strike took place. “They gathered underground, under a residential building, in the heart of the Dahiyeh, while using civilians as a human shield. They met to coordinate terror activities against Israeli civilians,” IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said. Hagari added that Aqil and the Radwan commanders had been discussing a plan to carry out an invasion of Israel’s Galilee region reminiscent of the Hamas atrocities in southern Israel on October 7. “Hezbollah intended to raid Israeli territory, occupy the communities of the Galilee, and murder and kidnap Israeli citizens — similar to what Hamas did on October 7,” he said.\n\n**Expert Analysis**\n\n“Israel is steadily dismantling both Hezbollah’s command structure and its fighting force. The elimination of the top command of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan terror leadership, including chief operations commander Ibrahim Aqil — a veteran terrorist who participated in the 1983 bombings of both the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut — is a particularly welcome development. Instead of distancing itself from Israel’s audacious operations, the Biden-Harris administration should recognize one obvious fact: The regional stability it craves can only come once Iran’s proxies, and the Islamic Republic itself, are decisively defeated and toppled.” — *Mark Dubowitz**, FDD CEO*\n\n“For months, Hezbollah has seemingly had the upper hand on the Israelis. However, Israel has managed to do the impossible and carry out significant strikes against Hezbollah, humbling its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and his supporters. The Jewish state must leverage this rare opportunity to set forth a clear strategy against Hezbollah if it seeks to achieve its war goal of returning displaced citizens to their homes in northern Israel.” *— **Joe Truzman**, Senior Research Analyst at FDD’s Long War Journal*\n\n**Aqil Wanted by U.S. for 1983 Beirut Embassy and Marine Barracks Bombings**\n\nAqil was a veteran terrorist who was wanted by the United States for his central role in the 1983 bombings of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in the Lebanese capital that took the lives of more than 300 people, including U.S. and French military personnel and diplomats as well as Lebanese civilians. On April 18, 2023 — the 40th anniversary of the U.S. Embassy bombing — the State Department’s Rewards for Justice program announced a $7 million reward for information on Aqil’s whereabouts.\n\nSpeaking following the elimination of Aqil and the other Radwan Force commanders, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant reiterated the Jewish state’s goal of returning the more than 60,000 Israels displaced by nearly one year of Hezbollah attacks safely to their homes. “Even in the Dahiyeh in Beirut, we will continue to pursue our enemy in order to protect our citizens,” Gallant said. “The sequence of operations in the new phase [of the war] will continue until our goal is achieved: The safe return of the residents of the north to their homes.”\n\n**Related Analysis**\n\n“Hezbollah Has Suffered ‘Major and Unprecedented’ Blow, Nasrallah Admits,” FDD Flash Brief\n\n“After Pager Explosions, Blasts From Hand-Held Radios Rock Lebanon,” FDD Flash Brief\n\n“Hundreds of Hezbollah Operatives Wounded as Pagers Explode Across Lebanon,” FDD Flash Brief",

        "content": "- President Donald Trump said on Saturday that US military aircraft had struck Iranian nuclear sites.\n- The bombings targeted sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan.\n- The US confirmed its forces used 14 GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs in the operation.\n\nThe US's \"massive precision strikes\" on three Iranian nuclear facilities unleashed the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bunker-buster bomb for the first time in combat.\n\nIn a press briefing Sunday morning, Gen. Dan Caine, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said US forces fired around 75 precision-guided weapons in total during the operation, which targeted facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. The weapons included 14 GBU-57s.\n\nThe GBU-57, designed to penetrate hardened bunkers, particularly those located deep underground, is among the heaviest and most powerful non-nuclear bombs in the US arsenal.\n\nHere's what we know about them.\n\nThe GBU-57 weighs roughly 30,000 pounds and can only be carried by the B-2 Spirit bomber. It is approximately 20.5 feet long and has a diameter of 31.5 inches.\n\nThe US Air Force says the bomb is designed to target \"weapons of mass destruction located in well-protected facilities\" and can penetrate up to 200 feet — or roughly two-thirds the height of the Statue of Liberty — below ground before exploding. The depth it can travel depends on the strength of the material it is penetrating.\n\nIran's Fordow facility is thought to be a key site for Tehran's nuclear enrichment activities, but its location — buried deep under a mountain — means Israel likely lacks the firepower to take it out on its own, according to Heather Williams, a senior fellow in the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nMultiple hits by a GBU-57, however, could destroy it, she said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who said late Saturday that a \"full payload\" of bombs had been used to strike Fordow, praised US forces for what he called a \"very successful attack.\"\n\nTrump called for peace in the aftermath of the US strikes on the nuclear sites.\n\nThe attacks are a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict. Earlier this month, Israel launched an intense air campaign against Iran aimed at degrading its nuclear capabilities. Tehran, which has said its nuclear program is for civilian purposes, has retaliated against Israel with heavy missile and drone strikes.\n\nTrump said earlier this week** **that he was considering US involvement and indicated he'd take two weeks to mull over decisions to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities. He appears to have determined that less time was necessary.\n\nIran had threatened to retaliate against the US and its forces in the Middle East if it got involved in the Israel-Iran conflict. The US armed forces have a substantial force presence in the volatile region that the Department of Defense has said is intended to protect and defend American interests.",

        "content": "# Israel kills Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in air strike on Beirut\n\n*Hezbollah confirms Nasrallah’s killing as Israel says it hit the group’s leaders at their headquarters in south Beirut.*\n\nHezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah has been killed in an air attack on Lebanon’s capital Beirut, according to Israel’s military and the Lebanese group, in what is a significant blow to Hezbollah as it reels from an escalating campaign of Israeli attacks.\n\n“Hassan Nasrallah is dead,” Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani announced on X on Saturday.\n\n## Recommended Stories\n\nlist of 4 items- list 1 of 4What we know about Israel’s latest attacks on Lebanon\n- list 2 of 4Waves of explosions rock Beirut as Israel says it attacked Hezbollah HQ\n- list 3 of 4‘Not serious’: Blinken again urges diplomacy as Israel strikes Beirut\n- list 4 of 4Families flee to Beirut’s seafront to escape devastating Israeli attacks\n\nAli Karki, the commander of Hezbollah’s southern front, and additional Hezbollah commanders were also killed in the massive air strike in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh on Friday, the Israeli military said. The strike levelled six apartment buildings while injuring 91 people, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.\n\n“Most of the senior leaders of Hezbollah have been eliminated,” Shoshani said.\n\nHezbollah confirmed Nasrallah’s killing later on Saturday and pledged to keep up the fight against Israel “in support of Gaza and Palestine, and in defence of Lebanon and its steadfast and honourable people”.\n\nThe statement confirmed Nasrallah was killed with other group members “following the treacherous Zionist strike on the southern suburbs” of Beirut.\n\nIsrael’s military said the country is on high alert following his killing.\n\n## ‘Larger than life’\n\nNasrallah, 64, led the Iran-backed group for more than 32 years, serving as a political and spiritual leader who guided Hezbollah to a place of prominence in Lebanon.\n\nAmong his supporters, the Shia leader was lauded for standing up to Israel and defying the United States. To his enemies, he was the head of a terrorist organisation and a proxy for Iran in its tussle for influence in the Middle East.\n\n“Hassan Nasrallah is a larger-than-life figure when it comes to the politics in the Middle East. He is the figurehead, Iran’s linchpin, if you will,” said Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker. “He really created Hezbollah into the organised fighting, disciplined force that it is today.”\n\n“He is not just a symbolic figure, he is a man who is behind the strategic thinking, the military thinking,” added Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr from Beirut. “No doubt this will be a major setback for the organisation.”\n\n\n\nNasrallah’s regional influence was on display over nearly a year of conflict ignited by the Gaza war, as Hezbollah entered the fray by firing on Israel from southern Lebanon in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas.\n\nWhile conflict with Israel largely defined Nasrallah’s leadership, he was a divisive figure in Lebanon and the wider Arab world due to Hezbollah’s operations in Syria and beyond.\n\nNasrallah also had numerous domestic foes, including Sunni and Druze political forces which Hezbollah has clashed with. In the years before his death, he was rarely seen in public due to security concerns.\n\nIsrael’s military, in its statement announcing Nasrallah’s killing, accused the leader of being responsible for the “murder of many Israeli civilians and soldiers, and the planning and execution of thousands of terrorist activities”.\n\n## Israel says its attacks will continue\n\nWhile many in Israel celebrated the killing of Nasrallah, Israel’s military said it still had a “ways to go” in the fight against Hezbollah and would continue targeting its leaders.\n\n“Hezbollah still has rockets and missiles and has the capability of shooting many of them simultaneously,” said Shoshani, adding that the Iran-backed group was believed to have “tens of thousands of rockets”.\n\nThe army’s chief of staff Herzi Halevi said: “The message is simple, anyone who threatens the citizens of Israel – we will know how to reach them.”\n\nNasrallah’s death is a major blow to Hezbollah, which has been hit by a wave of unprecedented attacks in recent weeks, including pager and walkie-talkie explosions targeting its members.\n\n“It is going to be extremely hard for the people of Lebanon who believe in the resistance to accept this assassination and the news of his death,” military analyst Elijah Magnier told Al Jazeera.\n\n“There is no other leader of the same charisma – not the leadership but the charisma – that Nasrallah enjoyed in Lebanon and throughout the Middle East among those who supported the resistance.”\n\nDekker said Nasrallah’s death also means the loss of a “major asset in the region” for Iran, where protesters have taken to the streets.\n\nIran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei remained defiant amid Nasrallah’s fate, saying Israel had not seriously hurt Hezbollah’s “strong structure”, and urging Muslims around the world to stand with Hezbollah in confronting Israel.\n\n“Let the Zionist criminals know that they are far too insignificant to cause any major damage to the strong structure of Hezbollah in Lebanon,” said Khamenei in reference to Israel.\n\n“By the grace of God, Lebanon will make the invading, wicked, and discredited enemy regret their actions,” he said.\n\nMore than 720 people have been killed in Lebanon since the conflict escalated on Monday, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry.\n\nThe United Nations says the number of those displaced by the conflict from southern Lebanon has more than doubled, with more than 211,000 people now displaced. At least 20 primary healthcare centres have shut down in hard-hit areas of Lebanon, the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.\n\nResidents have fled Dahiyeh, seeking shelter in downtown Beirut and other parts of the city following the waves of Israeli attacks that killed Nasrallah.\n\nDekker said that how Iran and Hezbollah move forward will pose major questions for the region.\n\n“What is Iran going to do? Is Iran going to respond? How will Hezbollah regroup?” Dekker said.\n\nMeanwhile, Tehran-based journalist Tohid Asadi told Al Jazeera that nobody is expecting Khamenei to outline a forthcoming plan of action.\n\n“So we have to wait for the next hours and days to see what takes place on the ground,” Asadi said.",

        "content": "# Israel Strikes Lebanon Again After Killing Hezbollah Leader\n\nThe bombings late Saturday were the latest in a week of stepped up attacks. A bombing on Friday assassinated Hassan Nasrallah, a stunning escalation in Israel’s campaign against the Iranian-backed group.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes battered areas near Beirut again on Saturday evening, hours after Hezbollah confirmed that its longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah had been killed in an Israeli bombing that destroyed residential buildings near Lebanon’s capital the night before.\n\nThe assassination, which Israel said hit the Iranian-backed militia’s underground headquarters, was a stunning escalation of Israel’s campaign against Hezbollah in a conflict that has gone on for nearly a year. Hezbollah began firing into northern Israel on Oct. 8 in solidarity with Hamas, which is also supported by Iran. Israel frequently responded, intensifying its attacks dramatically over the last two weeks, fueling fears of an all-out regional war that could draw in bigger players like Iran.\n\nMr. Nasrallah was a towering figure among anti-Israel forces across the Middle East and beyond, and his death struck a tremendous blow to Hezbollah. He played multiple roles in the lives of the group’s members, serving at once as a religious guide, political strategist and commander in chief.\n\nHis death deprives the organization of his vast experience, personal relationships with other militia leaders and the unifying force of his rhetoric and personality.\n\nIn what is perhaps a testament to Mr. Nasrallah’s power, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a video statement on Saturday that he had ordered the assassination because Mr. Nasrallah would have managed to rebuild Hezbollah’s capabilities, no matter how battered. But he said that “the work was still incomplete.”\n\nBoth Hezbollah and Israel’s military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, on Saturday vowed to continue fighting. The Israeli military announced a flurry of strikes on Hezbollah and its weapons caches throughout the day and into the night. Lebanon’s health ministry said that 33 people had been killed and 195 wounded as a result of Israel’s bombardment on Saturday.\n\n“We were hearing strikes all day during my shift,” Dania El Hallak, an internal medicine specialist at a Beirut hospital. She added that she had treated victims with everything from severe burns to crush injuries throughout the day.\n\nOn Saturday night, the Israeli military said projectiles had been launched from Lebanon, sounding sirens in the areas of Jerusalem and in the West Bank. The military said a fallen projectile in the West Bank ignited fires. Sirens also sounded in northern Israel near midnight.\n\nPresident Biden on Saturday said Mr. Nasrallah’s assassination “is a measure of justice for his many victims,” including Americans, but he called for a diplomatic resolution and an end to the fighting “for the broader Middle East region to gain stability.”\n\nHere’s what else to know:\n\n**Death toll:**Lebanon’s health ministry said on Saturday that at least 11 people had been killed and more than 100 injured, but the toll was expected to rise as emergency workers searched the rubble amid new Israeli air attacks.**Heavy bombs:**A video published by the Israeli military showed that planes it said were used in the attack that killed Mr. Nasrallah on Friday night carried 2,000-pound bombs, according to munitions experts and a New York Times analysis.**Internally displaced:**Israel’s airstrikes have contributed to a deepening sense of dread in Lebanon, where about 500,000 people have been displaced by the escalating conflict, according to the Lebanese health ministry. Thousands of people camped on the streets and beaches of Beirut, where Mr. Nasrallah’s death was met with grief and shock by some.**Mixed reactions:**In the West Bank, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and the Kashmir region of India mourners protested Mr. Nasrallah’s killing. But in parts of Syria, where Hezbollah helped President Bashar al-Assad wage a brutal crackdown on opponents, some were cautiously celebratory.**Iran’s response:**Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, mourned Mr. Nasrallah’s death and called on all Muslims to rise against Israel. But he did not pledge retaliation or revenge.**Losing track?:**Hezbollah has acknowledged only 10 members’ deaths — including Mr. Nasrallah’s — since Israel’s intensified air offensive on Monday, suggesting it may be unable to keep track of losses or is trying to conceal them. The Israeli military said on Saturday that it had killed a senior member of the group’s intelligence apparatus, Hassan Khalil Yassin.\n\nFarnaz Fassihi and Edward Wong contributed reporting.\n\nIn the immediate days after the deadly Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, Israeli intelligence officials feared a pre-emptive strike was imminent from another longtime enemy, Hezbollah. They frantically prepared to stop it with plans to strike and kill Hassan Nasrallah, the powerful Hezbollah leader who the Israelis knew would be in a bunker in Beirut.\n\nBut when Israel informed the White House of its plans, alarmed administration officials discounted the imminent Hezbollah strike. President Biden called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told him that killing Mr. Nasrallah would set off a regional war and asked him to hold his fire, current and former senior American and Israeli officials said.\n\nOn Saturday, Israel announced that it had killed Mr. Nasrallah after warplanes dropped more than 80 bombs on four apartment buildings in Lebanon, where the Hezbollah leader of more than three decades had gone to meet his top lieutenants. Mr. Biden was not informed ahead of time, aggravating the White House.\n\nBut the more salient outcome for both Israel and the United States was how successfully Israeli intelligence had pinpointed Mr. Nasrallah’s location and penetrated Hezbollah’s inner circle. In a matter of weeks, Israel has decimated the senior and midlevel ranks of Hezbollah and left the group reeling.\n\nThat success is a direct result of the country’s decision to devote far more intelligence resources in targeting Hezbollah after its 2006 war with the Iran-backed terrorist group. It was a defining moment for Israeli intelligence. The Israeli army and the intelligence agencies failed to score a decisive victory in that 34-day conflict, which ended with a U.N.-brokered cease-fire and allowed Hezbollah, despite heavy losses, to regroup and prepare for the next war with Israel.\n\nIsrael has spent the years since bolstering what was already considered one of the world’s best intelligence gathering operations. Much of the effort has been invested in the Mossad and Israeli military intelligence, which were frustrated after the 2006 war by their shortcomings in collecting vital information about Hezbollah’s leadership and strategy.\n\nAs a result, Unit 8200, Israel’s signals intelligence agency, built cutting-edge cyber tools to better intercept Hezbollah’s cellphones and other communications, and created new teams within the combat ranks to ensure that valuable information was quickly passed on to soldiers and the air force.\n\nIsrael also began flying more drones and its most advanced satellite over Lebanon to continuously photograph Hezbollah strongholds and document even the smallest changes to buildings that might, for example, reveal a weapons depot — work that one former Israeli intelligence official called “Sisyphean.” In the last week, Israel’s air force has pounded many of these targets.\n\nIn addition, Unit 8200 and its American counterpart, the National Security Agency, have forged stronger ties, which expanded the Israeli government’s information about mutual adversaries like Iran and Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael has used Lebanon’s proximity to its advantage — Jerusalem is less than 150 miles from the Lebanese border — to insert undercover commandos deep into the country to conduct sensitive intelligence missions.\n\nMost important, former U.S. and Israeli officials say that Israel’s audacity to carry out such operations set it apart from traditional intelligence agencies with less of an appetite for risk and legal hurdles.\n\n“They understand this has been and will be a protracted conflict,” said Chip Usher, a former top C.I.A. Middle East analyst who has worked extensively with Israeli intelligence. “They are putting in capabilities to serve their needs for the long term.”\n\nIsrael’s aggressiveness has resulted in a recent string of humiliating defeats for Hezbollah, even as Hezbollah has worked closely with Iran to improve its ability to ferret out Israeli spies and detect electronic intrusions.\n\nMr. Nasrallah admitted as much in a recent televised speech before his death. He said his group had suffered a “strong blow” after Israel detonated explosive-laden pagers and hand-held radios.\n\nIsrael’s investment in greater intelligence gathering after the failure in Lebanon first paid off in 2008, American and Israeli officials said. The Mossad, Israel’s external spy agency, worked with the C.I.A. to kill a top Hezbollah operative, Imad Mugniyah, in Syria.\n\nUnit 8200’s heightened focus on Hezbollah continued to pay off in January 2020. Israeli intelligence watched as Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the powerful commander heading Iran’s Quds Force, flew into Damascus and drove in a convoy to Beirut to meet Mr. Nasrallah. Israel decided not to attempt to kill Mr. Nasrallah at the time for fear of starting a war, but passed the information to the United States, which killed Mr. Suleimani in a drone strike at Baghdad International Airport.\n\nThis July Israel used a missile strike to kill Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah commander, while he was visiting his mistress in Beirut. Mr. Shukr, a close confidant of Mr. Nasrallah’s, was also wanted by the U.S. for his role in a 1983 bombing attack that killed roughly 300 American and French soldiers in Beirut.\n\nMore recently the fight has extended to Syria, where Unit 8200 provided information for Israel’s raid on Hezbollah and Iran’s secret missile factory in early September.\n\nIsrael had so penetrated Hezbollah’s cellphones that the group made the decision to transition to pagers and hand-held radios for communication. In response, Mossad began devising a plan to turn the pagers and radios into miniature bombs.\n\nThe Mossad appears to have created a shell company in Budapest and made the pagers under license from a company in Taiwan. Before the pagers arrived in Lebanon, Israeli operatives installed explosives inside them. The operation was scaled to produce thousands of pagers, requiring sophisticated manufacturing.\n\nIsrael detonated the pagers earlier this month. When Hezbollah figured out the hand-held radios were also compromised, Israeli officials rushed to detonate them too. The explosions also killed civilians, including children, and caused widespread panic in Lebanon.\n\nDays later the Israelis killed Ibrahim Aqeel, a top Hezbollah military commander, by bombing a Beirut apartment building where he was meeting with other senior commanders. They had tracked Mr. Aqeel as he moved back and forth from Beirut to southern Lebanon, where he oversaw Hezbollah’s group’s fighters and inspected tunnels he hoped to use to invade Israel.\n\nAs he walked into an apartment building in Beirut and took the stairs to a war room, Israel bombed the building, killing him and other senior Hezbollah commanders.\n\n“Aqeel has the blood of many Americans, Israelis and soldiers from the coalition countries in Iraq on his hands,” said Zohar Palti, a former top Mossad official and expert on Hezbollah.\n\nBut there was no greater target than Mr. Nasrallah. Mr. Netanyahu authorized the strike while he was in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, where he spoke on Friday.\n\n“The secrets of their success come down to a couple of factors,” said Mr. Usher, the former C.I.A. analyst who worked with Israeli intelligence. “They have a fairly defined target deck. That makes it easier for them to bring a tremendous amount of focus to what they do. They’re in a shadow war with Hezbollah and Iran.”\n\n“And they’re extraordinarily patient,” he added.\n\nJulie Tate and Gabby Sobelman contributed reporting.\n\n### Latest Images From the Middle East\n\n- Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times\n- Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times\n- David Guttenfelder for The New York Times\n- Reuters\n- Ibrahim Amro/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\n- Associated Press\n- Associated Press\n- Hussein Malla/Associated Press\n- Abbas Sharafeddine via Associated Press\n- Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times\n- Associated Press\n- Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times\n- Atef Safadi/EPA, via Shutterstock\n- Jim Urquhart/Reuters\n- Associated Press\n\nA video published by the Israeli military showed that planes it said were used in the attack that killed Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, on Friday night carried 2,000-pound bombs, according to munitions experts and a New York Times analysis.\n\nThe video showed eight planes fitted with at least 15 2,000-pound bombs, including the American-manufactured BLU-109 with a JDAM kit, a precision guidance system that attaches to bombs, according to Trevor Ball, a former U.S. Army explosive ordnance disposal technician. These bombs, a type of munition known as bunker busters, can penetrate underground before detonating.\n\nWes Bryant, a former U.S. Air Force targeting specialist who also reviewed the video, agreed with the analysis. In text messages with The Times, he said the bombs were “exactly what I would expect” to be used in what Israel has said was an attack on Mr. Nasrallah in Hezbollah’s underground headquarters.\n\nIn May, the Biden administration announced it had paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel because of concerns over civilian safety in Gaza.\n\nThe video, published Saturday on the Israeli military’s official Telegram channel with the caption “Israeli Air Force Fighter Jets Involved in the Elimination of Hassan Nasrallah and Hezbollah’s Central Headquarters in Lebanon,” shows at least eight planes in a row armed with 2,000-pound bombs. Some are too far away to clearly identify the exact model, but the closer planes are seen armed with BLU-109 bombs. That model of bomb is also identifiable when the video shows two planes taking off, with one plane carrying at least seven of those munitions. Then the video shows a plane returning at dusk to the Israeli air base without any bombs.\n\nWhile the video does not show the planes dropping the bombs, Mr. Ball said that videos showing the explosions in the densely populated southern suburbs of Beirut, as well as the damage caused, are consistent with the 2,000-pound bombs carried by the Israeli jets in the video. A New York Times analysis of verified videos, photos and satellite imagery showed that the attack destroyed at least four apartment buildings that were each at least seven stories tall.\n\nTwo senior Israeli defense officials told The Times that more than 80 bombs were dropped over a period of several minutes to kill Mr. Nasrallah, but did not confirm the type of munitions used. The Israeli military did not answer questions from The Times on the bombs seen in this video or used on the attack on Mr. Nasrallah. U.S. government officials referred questions on the munitions to the Israeli military.\n\nBuildings\n\nknown to be\n\ndestroyed in strike\n\nBeirut\n\nLocation\n\nof strike\n\nBuildings\n\nknown to be\n\ndestroyed in strike\n\nBeirut\n\nLocation\n\nof strike\n\nIsrael continued to pound Beirut’s southern suburbs on Saturday. Visual evidence analyzed by The Times shows at least 13 sites were struck on Friday and Saturday across at least three miles of densely developed city. The full extent of the strikes is unclear.\n\nLebanon’s health ministry said on Saturday that at least 33 people had been killed and more than 195 people injured by the strikes, and the toll is expected to rise with many still buried under rubble.\n\nMr. Nasrallah’s assassination was a stunning escalation of Israel’s campaign against Hezbollah in a conflict that has gone on for nearly a year. Hezbollah began firing into northern Israel on Oct. 8 in solidarity with Hamas, which is also supported by Iran, and Israel frequently responded, intensifying its attacks dramatically over the last two weeks. That has fueled fears of an all-out regional war that could draw in bigger players like Iran.\n\n*A correction was made on Sept. 29, 2024:** An earlier version of this report misstated the number of munitions carried by an Israeli military plane. It was at least seven, not six.*\n\nDevon Lum, Aaron Boxerman, Eric Schmitt and Ronen Bergman contributed reporting.

Israel has also killed three leaders of Hezbollah’s top military decision-making body, the Jihad Council: Fuad Shukr, Ali Karaki and Ibrahim Aqeel.\n\nAbove is a look at the organization’s remaining leadership.\n\nLebanon’s health ministry said that 33 people had been killed and 195 wounded as a result of Israel’s bombardment of Lebanon on Saturday.\n\nDania El Hallak, an internal medicine specialist at a Beirut hospital, said that Israeli strikes were landing closer to the health facility on the outskirts of the Lebanese capital’s southern suburbs. “We were hearing strikes all day during my shift — from 7am till 7pm,” she said, adding that she had treated victims with everything from severe burns to crush injuries.\n\nDavid Lammy, the foreign secretary of Britain, said on social media on Saturday that he had spoken to Prime Minister Najib Mikati of Lebanon and that the two agreed an immediate cease-fire was necessary to end the bloodshed. “A diplomatic solution is the only way to restore security and stability for the Lebanese and Israeli people,” Lammy wrote.\n\nBritain is among the nations that joined the United States in presenting a 21-day cease-fire proposal on Wednesday, one that Israeli officials have ignored.\n\nProtests took place on Saturday in multiple countries mourning the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanese militant organization Hezbollah.\n\nMr. Nasrallah, who was killed on Friday in an Israeli airstrike that leveled several residential buildings near Beirut, the Lebanese capital, was a towering figure not only in Lebanon but across the Middle East.\n\nOver his 32 years leading the organization, and with the support of Iran, he built Hezbollah into a domestic political force and one of the most heavily armed nonstate forces in the world. Mr. Nasrallah was opposed to Israel, which he called “the Zionist entity,” and maintained that there should be one Palestine with equality for Muslims, Jews and Christians. A powerful orator, he was beloved among many Shiite Muslims, a historically marginalized group in the Arab world, and created a state within a state in Lebanon that provided social services.\n\nProtesters gathered on Saturday not only in Lebanon, but also in Iran, in the West Bank and elsewhere to mourn his assassination.\n\nSome communities also welcomed Mr. Nasrallah’s death, including those in Lebanon who felt he used Hezbollah’s power to take the entire country hostage to his own interests, or those in places like Syria, where Hezbollah’s fighters had helped shore up the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria when it was threatened by a popular uprising.\n\nBut for many, his death came as a huge, almost unthinkable shock.\n\nIn Iran, which announced five days of mourning for Mr. Nasrallah, protesters gathered in Palestine Square in Tehran.\n\nLebanese and Palestinian men displayed photos of Mr. Nasrallah at a protest in the southern port city of Sidon, Lebanon. The announcement of the Hezbollah leader’s death set off screams and tears in parts of Beirut, the capital, on Saturday.\n\nMourners also gathered in Pakistan, where during one protest people shouted anti-Israel and anti-U.S. slogans, and in Srinagar, the capital of the disputed Kashmir region in India.\n\nProtesters held a vigil for Mr. Nasrallah in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, near a bridge leading to the heavily fortified neighborhood in the heart of the city known as the Green Zone.\n\nDemonstrators gathered in the city of Ramallah in the West Bank.\n\nReporting from Beirut\n\nIn Beirut’s Martyrs Square, dozens of people expressed shock and sadness at Hassan Nasrallah’s death. Jihad al-Ali told me he feels hopeless after the Hezbollah leader was killed.\n\nReeling from relentless Israeli bombardment that has shaken its most powerful political force, Lebanon faces a potentially dangerous moment, riddled with pitfalls that could entangle it in all-out war.\n\nBut, experts say, the battering of the Lebanese militia Hezbollah may also present a faint opportunity to end years of political deadlock that has mired the state in chaos and dysfunction.\n\nIsrael’s killing of Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has created a sense of instability in Lebanon, where the group was both an armed force and a powerful, longstanding political entity. But the loss of Hezbollah’s longtime leader could create a path to regaining stability, said Paul Salem, the vice president for international engagement at the Middle East Institute in Washington.\n\nLebanon has been in a worsening political crisis since 2019, when Hezbollah and its allies survived protests over a deep economic crisis, and since the outrage over a huge 2020 port explosion, widely attributed to government negligence. Political dysfunction in the state reached its nadir two years ago, when Hezbollah and its allies lost their parliamentary majority but maintained enough clout to block major decisions.\n\nSince 2022, Lebanon’s Parliament has been unable to name a president, and the country has been run by a caretaker prime minister with limited powers to lift the country out of its severe economic crisis and political disarray.\n\nSome politicians, including both rivals and allies of Hezbollah, have proposed using this moment to call an emergency session of Parliament, name a president and try to restore some functionality to the state.\n\n“A lot of Lebanese are saying, you know, tragic as it is, it shuffles the deck and probably gives more of an opening to do some long-needed domestic repairs,” Mr. Salem said. “A weakened, traumatized Hezbollah might even agree, because they’ll realize that they are going to need at least five years to recover.”\n\nThe wild card may be Hezbollah’s supporters among the country’s large Shiite Muslim community, tens of thousands of whom have been displaced by fierce Israeli bombardment across the south and east of the country, where Hezbollah holds sway. They have also borne the brunt of the death toll, which is already in the hundreds but expected to rise.\n\nLina Khatib, an associate fellow at the London-based research organization Chatham House, said a big question is how Hezbollah’s supporters react to the appearance of weakness in a force that long claimed to protect them.\n\n“There is wide anger among Hezbollah’s constituents that is likely to spill out onto the streets of Beirut and may spark clashes with Hezbollah’s opponents,” she said. “It’s important for Lebanon’s political leaders to take measures to restore calm and project a degree of unity.”\n\nSome political leaders have taken that approach with Lebanon’s Christians, whose sect customarily holds the presidential post. So has the former prime minister, Saad Hariri, a Sunni Muslim. He offered condolences over the killing of Mr. Nasrallah, even though Hezbollah has been accused of orchestrating the assassination of his father, who also served as prime minister.\n\nMr. Hariri called Mr. Nasrallah’s killing a “cowardly act condemned in its entirety by those of us who paid dearly with the lives of our loved ones, when assassination became an alternative to politics.”\n\n“What is required now is for everyone to rise above differences and selfishness to bring our country to safety,” he wrote in a statement.\n\nLebanese officials have stressed that they do not want a conflict with Israel. “We’d like to live without war — happily, as a tourist country, a beautiful country, good food — and we are not able to do it,” the foreign minister, Abdallah BouHabib, told the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace before Mr. Nasrallah’s killing this week. “And so there is a lot of depression, especially with the latest escalation.”\n\nBut as has long been the case in tiny Lebanon, where different parties and sects are often influenced by a wide array of international actors, the reactions of foreign powers could affect the fallout.\n\nJoshua Landis, a professor of Middle East politics at the University of Oklahoma, wrote on social media that efforts by Israel and the United States to push Lebanon to sever ties with Iranian influence and purge Hezbollah and its allies from the state could stoke unrest.\n\nIf Lebanese politicians call for the Lebanese military to spread and take control of the state, he added, they would face wariness and hostility from Hezbollah and its supporters, who will fear any attempt to completely disarm them.\n\nShiite forces and their allies, Mr. Landis said, “will resist, and Lebanon’s fragile stability will again be shattered.”\n\nWith a fragile government, a struggling economy and the competing motives of armed groups and foreign powers, Lebanon could slide from instability to greater violence, experts say. Sectarian conflict has long plagued the country, which was mired in civil war from 1975 until 1990.\n\nThat is why, even though many of Mr. Nasrallah’s rivals in Lebanon welcomed his death, Israel’s continued airstrikes after his killing could create new problems, said Nadim Shehadi, an independent Lebanese analyst.\n\n“Israel is on a rampage and is its own worst enemy,” said Mr. Shehadi.\n\nThe longer the bombardment lasts, he said, the more it erodes divisions in the Middle East between those who want to fight Israel and those who would rather reach some kind of settlement with it.\n\n“Israel is not making it easy to be on that other side,” he said. “Even the most moderate person, or the most Israel-friendly person in Lebanon, is shocked by the inhumanity that they have shown.”\n\nAryn Baker contributed reporting.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Nasrallah’s assassination was necessary to advance Israel’s goal of returning tens of thousands of residents to northern Israel. He added that Nasrallah was responsible for the deaths of countless Israelis and citizens of other nations. “He was not just a terrorist,” Netanyahu said. “He was *the* terrorist.”\n\nYemen’s Houthi rebels said they fired a ballistic missile at Israel’s Ben Gurion airport upon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s arrival, according to a statement from the group's military spokesperson. Israel said it was intercepted. “The operations will not stop until the aggression on Gaza and Lebanon ceases,” Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said.\n\nIn his first remarks on the assassination, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, called Nasrallah “the main engine of Iran’s axis of evil.” Netanyahu said in a statement released by his office that, as long as Nasrallah lived, he would manage to rebuild Hezbollah’s capabilities, no matter how battered.\n\nFrance is calling for an immediate end to Israeli strikes in Lebanon and is opposed to any ground operations, the French foreign ministry said on Saturday. France urged other actors, particularly Hezbollah and Iran, to “refrain from any action likely to lead to further destabilization,” the ministry said in a statement, after a phone call between France’s foreign minister and the Lebanese prime minister.\n\nAbdul-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, has vowed to avenge the death of Hezbollah's leader. “We will move toward escalation and developing our military performance,” al-Houthi said in a televised speech. Since the start of the war in Gaza, the Houthis have attacked international shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden and launched missiles and drones at Israel.\n\nFor some Israelis, Nasrallah’s killing was a rare moment of unabated victory in what has become a seemingly endless war of attrition now nearing its one-year anniversary. On Israel’s most-watched news network, Amit Segal, a well-known journalist, passed out liquor to his fellow panelists live on the air to toast Nasrallah’s death on Saturday night.\n\nLebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, apologized for “shortcomings” in dealing with the sudden influx of displaced across the country. Some have reported being turned away from shelters due to a lack of space. Others arrived to find there was not even bedding, with international organizations and civil society groups increasingly forced to step in.\n\nSergey V. Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia, said at a news conference on Saturday at the United Nations that Israel’s killing of Hassan Nasrallah and its wartime support from the United States amounted to a “political assassination.” He also denounced Israel’s “collective punishment” of Palestinians in Gaza for the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, and he criticized the United States for trying to “monopolize” mediation efforts in the war.\n\nLavrov said the series of killings in the region that Israel has carried out in recent months, including Nasrallah's, are “cynical” moves aimed at igniting a war with Iran and dragging the United States into a wider conflict. He said that, so far, Iran’s leaders have behaved “very responsibly.” When asked whether Iran might retaliate, he said he could not speak for Iranian officials.\n\nThe Lebanese government has declared three days of mourning beginning Monday in the wake of Nasrallah’s death. Hezbollah is not just a militant group but also an established political party. It has 13 seats in Lebanon’s Parliament and has held seats in the Cabinet since 2005.\n\nMohammad al-Shammary, a Syrian refugee living in eastern Turkey, called Nasrallah’s death “the sweetest news ever.” Like many Syrians opposed to the Iranian-backed regime in Damascus, he reviled Hezbollah for fighting on its behalf during the civil war. “When we heard Nasrallah was dead — even if the devil himself killed him — we would have rejoiced,” said al-Shammary.\n\nThe Israeli military said on Saturday that it had targeted and killed a senior member of Hezbollah’s intelligence apparatus, Hassan Khalil Yassin, in a strike in Dahiya, the Hezbollah-dominated area near Beirut. Yassin stood “at the head of a department responsible for the identification of civilian and military targets,” the military said. These targeted assassinations in Lebanon’s capital have significantly ramped in recent days.\n\nHezbollah appears to have largely stopped tallying the deaths of their members, which it has done consistently since last October. If the group’s figures are to be believed, only 10 of their members — including Nasrallah — have been killed since Israel ramped up its air offensive over Lebanon on Monday. This suggests they are either unable to keep track of their losses, or they are actively trying to conceal them.\n\nIn Iran, reaction to Nasrallah’s death among ordinary Iranians was mixed. Supporters of the government staged public mourning rituals on the streets — crying, waving the flag of Hezbollah and chanting “death to Israel.” But opponents of the government and dissidents rejoiced, and in Tehran at several traffic intersections people were handing out boxes of sweets, according to witnesses.\n\nResidents of Israel’s northern communities had long watched Hezbollah’s leader, wondering whether their lives might be upended by a renewed round of violence, said Ofir Yehezkeli, the deputy mayor of Kiryat Shemona, an Israeli border city made into a lifeless shadow of its former self by Hezbollah rocket fire.\n\n“Since I was a child, we were always following what he said, and his speeches, to know whether there would be rocket attacks or not,” he said. “It’s the end of an era. It’s history in the making.”\n\nThe city’s residents are now scattered, having fled Hezbollah bombardments and the fear of a land assault by the Lebanese armed group. The repeated blows to Hezbollah over the past two weeks have generated some hope that they might be able to return home, Yehezkeli said.\n\n“There’s a sense of optimism and hope, that things are moving,” he added.\n\nAs the hours passed with no word from Hezbollah’s leader after Israeli airstrikes shook Beirut on Friday evening, his followers, his critics and the many Lebanese who have lived in his shadow for decades waited on tenterhooks for news that could radically change the course of the war engulfing their country.\n\nSome supporters refused to even entertain the idea that he could be gone. Yet on Saturday afternoon, the announcement came: Hezbollah confirmed his death. Hassan Nasrallah, the cleric who over 30 years helped build the militant group into a force throughout Lebanon and the Middle East, was gone.\n\nThe announcement set off screams and tears in parts of Beirut where people were camping out after fleeing the Dahiya, the Hezbollah-dominated area near the Lebanese capital that had emptied out as Israel pounded it with airstrikes overnight. Some collapsed in each other’s arms, others shouted that it could not be true. Yet in other parts of Beirut, people fired gunshots into the air in celebration.\n\nAlong the corniche, a seaside promenade, a 50-year-old Dahiya resident named Nada, sat on a bench overlooking the sea, her eyes swollen and red from crying.\n\n“It’s a huge loss for us. He meant everything to us: security, safety, honor,” said Nada, who like many other followers declined to give her full name, given the volatility of the moment. “He was our protector in Lebanon, because the government is absent. Nobody defended us except him.”\n\nThe “Sayyid,” as Mr. Nasrallah was called by many, was one of the most polarizing figures in Lebanon, a reflection of the sectarian divisions in a country perpetually mired in strife among its 18 officially recognized religious groups.\n\nHe was beloved among Shiite Muslims, a historically marginalized group in the Arab world, who said he stood up for them and defended their heartland in southern Lebanon from Israel. But many from Lebanon’s Christian, Sunni Muslim and Druze sects have historically felt nothing but enmity for Mr. Nasrallah, arguing that he used Hezbollah’s power to take the entire country hostage to his own interests.\n\nOn Saturday, some Beirut residents blamed Mr. Nasrallah for dragging Lebanon into the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza — a conflict they felt was not their own.\n\n“We’re paying the price for the sake of others,” said a man drinking coffee with friends in a Sunni neighborhood who gave his name as Youssef al-Abiyad. Now that Mr. Nasrallah was gone, he said, “We’ll reach a compromise. And there’s no way other than compromise.”\n\nRegardless of whether they revered or reviled him, Mr. Nasrallah had maintained such an aura of untouchability that his death came, above all, as a disquieting shock.\n\n“They are targeting the most powerful party in Lebanon. God knows what this will usher forward,” said Joseph Haddad, 60, as he played backgammon at an intersection in Achrafieh, a predominantly Christian neighborhood.\n\nHe was not alone in fearing that sectarian strife might erupt: Lebanese soldiers could be seen deploying across Beirut on Saturday in a bid to preserve calm.\n\nMany of Mr. Nasrallah’s supporters clung to defiant disbelief, or just defiance.\n\n“It’s a rumor! He’s alive! He’s alive!” a group of women shouted from the balcony of a building in Hamra, in west Beirut. People erupted in cheers and screams.\n\n“We’ll keep following his path,” Jamila Ghaith, 53, cried out as she absorbed the news on the steps of the large mosque in downtown Beirut, where she and others were camping out after fleeing the Dahiya. “Even if he died, he’ll win.”\n\nShe added that her six children would keep following in his footsteps. “Even if I lose all six,” she said, “I don’t care.”\n\nIn the Sunni neighborhood of Tarek al-Jdideh, a Sunni woman displaced from the Dahiya, Nadia Khalil, was still smiling, convinced Mr. Nasrallah was alive. “He’ll be back again,” she said. “My heart said so.”\n\nShe was not the only non-Shiite interviewed on Saturday who praised Mr. Nasrallah for fighting Israel. Others who once despised Mr. Nasrallah expressed some ambivalence about his assassination, underscoring how Israel’s assaults on Gaza and Lebanon have rallied even Hezbollah’s critics to unite against Israel.\n\n“As a nation, we don’t want war, we only want peace,” said a 26-year-old Druze man, Sultan Monzer. “It’s true, we are against Nasrallah — but that doesn’t mean we support Israel.”\n\nThe State Department has announced that it is ordering the departure of family members of employees working at the U.S. mission in Lebanon and of non-essential workers. It cited the “volatile and unpredictable security situation in Beirut.” Its travel advisory on Lebanon for Americans is still Level 4: Do not go there.\n\nPresident Biden said the killing of Hassan Nasrallah “is a measure of justice for his many victims,” including Americans, but he called for the combatants now to accept diplomatic agreements to end the fighting.\n\n“It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain stability,” he said in a written statement.\n\nBiden said that the United States “fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah” and other Iranian-backed terrorist groups. He said he has directed Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III to “further enhance the defense posture of U.S. military forces in the Middle East region to deter aggression and reduce the risk of a broader regional war.”\n\n## A decimated Hezbollah is a serious blow to Iran. How it responds will affect the region, and beyond.\n\nThe death of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike has dramatically weakened a key Iranian deterrent against its archenemy, Israel.\n\nIran has long sought to have the proxies it supports in the region — including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and forces in Syria, Yemen and Iraq — serve as the front line in its long-running fight with Israel. But if its most important military asset, Hezbollah, has been decimated, it may have no choice but to respond, experts said Saturday.\n\nThe decisions it makes will have a significant impact on the next stage of a growing conflict that now threatens to engulf the region.\n\n“Iran’s choices really range from ugly to unpalatable,” said Ali Vaez, the director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group, a conflict prevention organization.\n\nJulien Barnes-Dacey, the Middle East and North Africa program director at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Israel’s assassination of Mr. Nasrallah significantly raises the risk of a dangerous conflagration in the Middle East, and beyond.\n\n“It really is a question of whether Hezbollah has the capacity to launch wide-ranging missile strikes on Israel at this point,” Mr. Barnes-Dacey said. If it does not, “this could now push Iran to make a dash for nuclear weapons because they see that as their only effective form of deterrence left standing.”\n\nMr. Nasrallah’s death is a significant loss for Iran. Not only was he a charismatic leader who has inspired generations of anti-Israeli sentiment, he was also very close to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He was also his principal liaison to the Arabic-speaking world.\n\nMr. Khamenei issued a statement of condolences after Hezbollah confirmed its leader’s death, calling on all Muslims to rise against Israel with all their might and stand with Hezbollah and Lebanon. “All of the forces of the resistance are standing by and supporting Hezbollah,” Mr. Khameni said. “The fate of this region will be determined by the resistance with Hezbollah at the top.”\n\nIt is not the first time that Israel has decapitated Hezbollah.\n\nIn 1992, Israel killed Nasrallah’s predecessor, Abbas al-Musawi. “Israel has assassinated multiple Hamas leaders over recent decades, and on all occasions, these groups have come back — stronger, more radical, and posing an even graver threat to Israel,” Mr. Barnes-Dacey said.\n\nMr. Nasrallah’s death was the culmination of a multiweek assault that started with an attack on a Syrian weapons facility supplying arms to Hezbollah, and was followed by a sophisticated sabotage operation on Hezbollah pagers and radios that killed or incapacitated scores of commanders and damaged the militia’s ability to communicate.\n\nSubsequent airstrikes took out even more commanders. But other than denouncing the attacks in speeches and statements, Iran has largely stood by the sidelines. Mr. Nasrallah’s assassination could be the blow that finally forces Iran to react.\n\nIt is not yet clear how much damage the Israeli attacks have done to Hezbollah’s substantial arsenal of weapons, but if the militia has been significantly incapacitated, Iran may not have many options for retaliation.\n\nIran certainly has the capabilities to attack Israel itself, as it proved in April when it launched a drone and missile attack. But Israel could also deal a very severe setback to Iran both militarily and economically, and that is something that the Iranian government does not want, Mr. Vaez said. “They know that any attack by Iran would then allow Israel to further expand the war and drag Iran into a direct military confrontation with the United States,” he added.\n\nIf Hezbollah still has capabilities that it can deploy, Mr. Vaez said, that’s probably the likeliest response. “Iran wants to stay out of this as long as it can.”\n\nIran is good at playing a long game, said Paul Salem, the vice president for international engagement at the Middle East Institute in Washington. Instead of reacting with an immediate barrage against Israel, Iran could instead pull back, quietly help Hezbollah repair the damage to its weapons stores and its leadership, and start rebuilding what’s left.\n\nUnlike Hamas, Hezbollah is not encircled by Israel. The militia has access to weapons supplies from Iranian allies in Syria and Iraq via the relatively porous Lebanese border.\n\n“Hezbollah will, over time, find new leaders,” Mr. Salem said. “Those leaders can be trained and armed and given a new set of tactics and strategy. They have suffered a tremendous loss. But it’s not the end of Hezbollah.”\n\nLeily Nikounazar and Farnaz Fassihi contributed reporting.",

        "content": "# Israel kills Hezbollah leader Nasrallah in airstrike\n\nJERUSALEM/BEIRUT, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Israel killed Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in a powerful airstrike in Beirut, dealing a heavy blow to the Iran-backed group as it reels from an escalating campaign of Israeli attacks.\n\nThe Israeli military said on Saturday it had eliminated Nasrallah in the strike on the group's central command headquarters in Beirut's southern suburbs on Friday. Hezbollah confirmed he had been killed, without saying how.\n\nNasrallah's death is a major blow to both Hezbollah and Iran, removing an influential ally who helped build Hezbollah into the linchpin of Tehran's network of allied groups in the Arab world.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the killing of Nasrallah as a necessary step toward \"changing the balance of power in the region for years to come.\"\n\n\"Nasrallah was not a terrorist, he was the terrorist,\" Netanyahu said in a statement, warning of challenging days ahead.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden described Nasrallah's death as a measure of justice for what he called his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis and Lebanese, and said the U.S. fully supported Israel's right to self-defence.\n\nBut when asked if an Israeli ground incursion into Lebanon was inevitable, Biden told reporters on Saturday: \"It's time for a ceasefire.\"\n\nA senior member of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, deputy commander Abbas Nilforoushan, was also killed in the Israeli attacks in Beirut on Friday, Iranian media reported.\n\nSources told Reuters that Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had been moved to a secure location in Iran following Nasrallah's killing.\n\nIran later called for a United Nations Security Council meeting on Israel's actions in Lebanon and elsewhere in the region. It also warned against any attacks on its diplomatic facilities and representatives.\n\n\"Iran will not hesitate to exercise its inherent rights under international law to take every measure in defense of its vital national and security interests,\" Iran's U.N. ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said in a letter to the 15-member council.\n\nIsraeli strikes in Lebanon killed 33 people and wounded 195 others on Saturday, the Lebanese health ministry said.\n\nThe strikes continued on Beirut's southern suburbs throughout the early evening on Saturday, according to a Reuters live broadcast, sending large clouds of smoke over the city.\n\nOne Israeli strike hit an industrial area 500 metres (yards) from Beirut airport buildings, a security source told Reuters. The airport continued to operate normally, according to Middle East Airlines boss Mohammad al-Hout.\n\nMore than 1,000 people have been killed and more than 6,000 wounded as a result of Israeli attacks in the past two weeks, the health ministry said, and about one million Lebanese have been displaced by the strikes, including hundreds of thousands since Friday, Nasser Yassin, the minister coordinating the government's crisis response, told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nIsrael said it killed a senior Hezbollah intelligence official in a strike on southern Beirut, naming him as Hassan Khalil Yassin. Hezbollah has made no mention of this.\n\nIn Israel, air raid sirens sounded across the centre of the country - including Tel Aviv - and large bangs were heard after a missile was fired from Yemen and intercepted, according to the Israeli military.\n\nA projectile fired from Lebanon crashed in the occupied West Bank, sparking fires, the Israeli military said. There were no casualties, according to the Israeli ambulance service.\n\nHezbollah said in a statement that it would continue its battle against Israel \"in support of Gaza and Palestine, and in defence of Lebanon and its steadfast and honourable people\".\n\nIran's Khamenei said Nasrallah's death would be avenged and his path in fighting Israel would be pursued by other militants.\n\nLebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said his country was facing the threat of danger, without mentioning the death of Nasrallah. His office later announced three days of mourning for the Hezbollah chief.\n\nHezbollah and Israel have been fighting a conflict in parallel with Israel's war against the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza since Hamas' attack on Israel last Oct. 7, in a cross-border confrontation that has sharply escalated in recent days.\n\nHezbollah's Al-Manar TV aired verses from the Koran after Nasrallah's death was announced. Bursts of gunfire were heard in Beirut and Lebanon's army deployed tanks in the city centre, according to Reuters witnesses.\n\nThe Israeli military said Nasrallah was eliminated in a \"targeted strike\" on the group's underground headquarters below a residential building in Dahiyeh - a Hezbollah-controlled southern suburb of Beirut. It said he was killed along with senior Hezbollah official Ali Karaki and other commanders.\n\nNasrallah's death is by far the largest blow in a traumatic fortnight for Hezbollah, starting with a deadly strike on thousands of communications devices used by its members.\n\nDays later, Israel significantly ramped up airstrikes in Lebanon, killing several top Hezbollah commanders and hundreds of other people across wide areas of the country.\n\n## SUCCESSION\n\nMany Hezbollah supporters were in disbelief on Saturday.\n\n\"He was leading us. He was everything to us. We were under his wings,\" one supporter, Zahraa, told Reuters tearfully by phone from a school where she had been displaced to overnight.\n\nHezbollah gave no immediate indication of who might succeed Nasrallah. Senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine has long been regarded as heir apparent. The group has not issued any statement on Safieddine's status or that of any other Hezbollah leaders - apart from Nasrallah - since the attack.\n\nHezbollah continued its cross-border rocket fire on Saturday, setting off sirens and sending residents running for shelter deep inside Israel. Israeli missile defences blocked some of them and there was no immediate report of injuries.\n\nThe escalation has increased fears the conflict could spin out of control, potentially drawing in Iran, Hezbollah's principal backer, as well as the United States.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel's war was not with the Lebanese people, calling Nasrallah the \"murderer of thousands of Israelis and foreign citizens\". Gallant held talks late on Saturday about possibly expanding Israel's military offensive on its northern front, his office said.\n\nBiden, who had no advance warning of the strike that killed Nasrallah, said the U.S. aimed to de-escalate the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon through diplomatic means.\n\nHezbollah has said it would cease fire only when Israel's Gaza offensive ends. Hamas and other allies of Hezbollah issued statements mourning his death.\n\nRussia said it strongly condemned Nasrallah's killing and urged Israel to stop hostilities in Lebanon.\n\n## LEBANON ASKS IRANIAN PLANE NOT TO LAND\n\nResidents fled Dahiyeh, seeking shelter in downtown Beirut and other parts of the city.\n\n\"Yesterday's strikes were unbelievable. We had fled before and then went back to our homes, but then the bombing got more and more intense, so we came here, waiting for Netanyahu to stop the bombing,\" said Dalal Daher, speaking near Beirut's Martyrs Square, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIsrael says it has been attacking Hezbollah with the aim of allowing tens of thousands of residents evacuated from northern Israel to return home.\n\nLebanon's transport ministry asked an Iranian plane not to enter Lebanese airspace after Israel warned air traffic control at the Beirut airport that it would use \"force\" if it landed, a ministry source told Reuters. The source said it was not clear what was on the plane, adding: \"The priority is people\".\n\nLate on Friday, Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israeli air force planes would not allow \"hostile flights with weapons to land\" there.\n\nSign up here.\n\nReporting by Maya Gebeily, Timour Azhari, Laila Bassam, and Tom Perry in Beirut; James Mackenzie and Ari Rabinovitch in Jerusalem; Jana Choukeir, Nadine Awadalla, Adam Makary, Jaidaa Taha, Clauda Tanios and Tala Ramadan in Dubai; Michelle Nichols in New York; Andrea Shalal, Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali in Washington; Writing by Tom Perry, William Maclean and David Morgan; Editing by Angus MacSwan, Frances Kerry, Daniel Wallis and Deepa Babington\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

        "content": "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced on Saturday that it eliminated Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, along with commander Ali Karaki, in a Beirut airstrike the previous day.\n\n“The IDF announces that yesterday (Friday), Sept. 27, 2024, Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Hezbollah terrorist organization and one of its founders, was eliminated by the IDF, together with Ali Karaki, the Commander of Hezbollah’s Southern Front, and additional Hezbollah commanders,” said the IDF.\n\nIn addition to Nasrallah and Karaki, Iranian media reported that Israel killed Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Brigadier General Abbas Nilforooshan in the strike. Nilforooshan had replaced IRGC Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who Israel eliminated in an airstrike in Syria on April 1.\n\nThe IDF said that Israeli fighter jets carried out strikes on Hezbollah’s Central Headquarters while Hassan Nasrallah and other leaders gathered for a meeting.\n\n“Following precise intelligence from the IDF and Israeli security establishment, IAF fighter jets conducted a targeted strike on the Central Headquarters of the Hezbollah terrorist organization, which was located underground embedded under a residential building in the area of Dahieh in Beirut. The strike was conducted while Hezbollah’s senior chain of command were operating from the headquarters and advancing terrorist activities against the citizens of the State of Israel,” noted the Israeli military.\n\nWhile Hezbollah’s allies awaited the news of Nasrallah’s fate on Friday evening, many residents of Azaz in northwest Syria who experienced atrocities at the hands of the Lebanese-based group during the civil war celebrated the news about the leader’s possible demise.\n\nOn Saturday, Hezbollah officially acknowledged the death of Hassan Nasrallah in a statement posted on the organization’s Telegramchannel. However, the group has yet to acknowledge the death of Ali Karaki or other military figures who were with Nasrallah at the time of the attack.\n\nIran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei issued a statement on X mourning Nasrallah’s death, saying, “After all his struggle on the path of God, the reward of martyrdom was Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah’s rightful recompense.”\n\nOther actors belonging to the Axis of Resistance, including Hamas, Iraqi militias, and the Houthis, published statements of condolence and support for Hezbollah. Furthermore, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria declared three days of mourning over Nasrallah’s death.\n\nSince Friday’s strike, Israel continued to attack Hezbollah targets across Lebanon. IDF Arabic Spokesperson Avichay Adraee issued statements warning residents of some sections of Beirut’s Dahieh, the Beqaa Valley, and southern Lebanon to evacuate if they were located near Hezbollah sites.\n\nHezbollah has continued to fire rockets on Israeli territory but has not increased the scope or intensity of its attacks. For their part, Hezbollah’s Houthi allies in Yemen fired a missile at Israeli territory on Saturday. However, the IDF noted that Israel’s missile defense system intercepted the projectile.",

Chinese scientists have an idea\n\nChinese researchers test measures aimed at striking the weak spot of massive US warheads with anti-aircraft shells\n\nReading Time:\n\n**2 minutes**Why you can trust SCMP\n\n37\n\nStephen Chenin Beijing\n\nPrecision-guided bunker busters fly slowly but carry massive warheads wrapped in thick armour. Small nations without air power watch helplessly as bombs fall.\n\nWhen US B-2 stealth bombers struck Iran’s nuclear sites with GBU-57 MOP (Massive Ordnance Penetrator) bunker busters on June 22, there was reportedly little resistance.\n\nChinese researchers have offered a countermeasure: strike the weak flank. Although the bomb’s nose armour is thick, its steel sides are thin and measure just a few centimetres, meaning one or two anti-aircraft shells could crack it open.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLow-cost anti-aircraft guns can be deployed around key sites. But the guns must survive, radar must track and electronic warfare must be countered.\n\nInstead of China’s own weapon, the computer simulation used Swiss Oerlikon GDF guns which are widely fielded in the Middle East, including Iran.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe GDF fires 36 shells in two seconds. At 1,200 metres (0.7 miles), the kill probability hits 42 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSelect Voice\n\nChoose your listening speed\n\nGet through articles 2x faster\n\n1.25x\n\n250 WPM\n\nSlow\n\nAverage\n\nFast\n\n1.25x",

        "content": "# Israel says it struck Hezbollah's headquarters as huge explosions rocked Beirut\n\nBEIRUT — The Israeli military struck Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut on Friday in a series of massive explosions that targeted the leader of the militant group and leveled multiple high-rise apartment buildings. The biggest blast to hit the Lebanese capital in the past year appeared likely to push the escalating conflict closer to full-fledged war. At least two people were killed and dozens were wounded, Lebanon's health ministry said.\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strikes on the group's headquarters, according to two people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity, including one U.S. official. The Israeli army declined comment. It was not immediately clear if Nasrallah was at the site, and Hezbollah did not comment on the report.\n\nAfter the strikes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly cut short a visit to the United States to return home. Hours earlier, he addressed the U.N., vowing that Israel's intensified campaign against Hezbollah over the past two weeks would continue — further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire.\n\nNews of the blasts came as Netanyahu was briefing reporters after his U.N. address. A military aide whispered into his ear, and Netanyahu quickly ended the briefing.\n\nIsraeli army spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the strikes targeted the main Hezbollah headquarters, saying it was located underground beneath residential buildings.\n\nThe series of blasts at around nightfall reduced six apartment towers to rubble in Haret Hreik, a densely populated, predominantly Shiite district of Beirut's Dahiyeh suburbs, according to Lebanon's national news agency. A wall of billowing black and orange smoke rose into the sky as windows were rattled and houses shaken some 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of Beirut.\n\nThe Health Ministry reported two people killed and 76 others wounded but said the figure was likely to rise as first responders were still searching under the rubble. Footage showed rescue workers clambering over large slabs of concrete, surrounded by high piles of twisted metal and wreckage. Several craters were visible, one with a car toppled into it. A stream of residents carrying their belongings were seen fleeing along a main road out of the district.\n\nTo a degree unseen in past conflicts, Israel this past week has aimed to eliminate Hezbollah's senior leadership. But an attempt to assassinate Nasrallah – successful or not – would be a major escalation. The Pentagon said the U.S. had no advance warning of the strikes.\n\nNasrallah has been in hiding for years, very rarely appearing in public. He regularly gives speeches, but always by video from unknown locations. The site hit Friday evening had not been publicly known as Hezbollah's main headquarters, though it is located in the group's \"security quarters,\" a heavily guarded part of Haret Hreik where it has offices and runs several nearby hospitals.\n\nFour hours after the strike, Hezbollah had still not issued any statement referring to it. Instead, it announced that it had launched a salvo of rockets at the Israeli city of Safed, which it said was \"in defense of Lebanon and its people, and in response to the barbaric Israeli violation of cities, villages and civilians.\"\n\nThe Israeli military said a house and a car in Safed were hit, without providing details.\n\nIsrael dramatically intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is determined to put an end to more than 11 months of Hezbollah fire into its territory. The escalated campaign has killed more than 720 people in Lebanon, including dozens of women and children, according to Health Ministry statistics. A predawn strike Friday in the mainly Sunni border town of Chebaa killed nine members of the same family, the state news agency said.\n\nThe scope of Israel's operation remains unclear, but officials have said a ground invasion to push the militant group away from the border is a possibility. Israel has moved thousands of troops toward the border in preparation.\n\nAt the U.N., Netanyahu vowed to \"continue degrading Hezbollah\" until Israel achieves its goals. His comments dampened hopes for a U.S.-backed call for a 21-day truce between Israel and Hezbollah to allow time for a diplomatic solution. Hezbollah has not responded to the proposal.\n\nIranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, saying it was a show of support for the Palestinians. Since then, it and the Israeli military have traded fire almost daily, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes on both sides of the border.\n\nAn Israeli security official said he expects the campaign against Hezbollah would not last for as long as the current war in Gaza, because the military's goals are much narrower.\n\nIn Gaza, Israel aims to dismantle Hamas' military and political regime, but the goal in Lebanon is to push Hezbollah away from the border -- \"not a high bar like Gaza\" in terms of operational objectives, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to military briefing guidelines.\n\nThe Israeli military said it carried out dozens of strikes around the south Friday, targeting targeting Hezbollah rocket launchers and infrastructure. It said Hezbollah fired a volley of rockets toward the northern Israeli city of Tiberias.\n\nIn the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, civil defense workers pulled the bodies of two women – 35-year-old Hiba Ataya and her mother Sabah Olyan – from the rubble of a building brought down by a strike.\n\n\"That's Sabah, these are her clothes, my love,\" one man cried out as her body emerged.\n\nIsrael says its accelerated strikes this week have already inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah's weapons capabilities and its fighters. But the group boasted a large arsenal of rockets and missiles and its remaining capacities remain unknown.\n\nHezbollah officials and their supporters remain defiant. Not long before the explosions Friday evening, thousands massed in another part of Beirut's suburbs for the funeral of three Hezbollah members killed in earlier strikes, including the head of the group's drone unit, Mohammed Surour.\n\nMen and women in the giant crowd waved their fists in the air and chanted, \"We will never accept humiliation\" as they marched marched behind the three coffins, wrapped in the group's yellow flag.\n\nHussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's top official in Beirut, said in a speech that no matter how many commanders Israel kills, the group has endless numbers of experienced fighters. He vowed that Hezbollah will keep fighting until Israel stops its offensive in Gaza.\n\n\"We will not abandon the support of Palestine, Jerusalem and oppressed Gaza,\" Fadlallah said. \"There is no place for neutrality in this battle.\"",

Such shots are rare and instantly memorable, showcasing the skill and creativity that make golf so captivating.\n\nOne of the most thrilling moments in golf is when a player pulls off an eagle from a bunker, a feat that demands precision and nerve. Such shots are rare and instantly memorable, showcasing the skill and creativity that make golf so captivating.\n\nIn recent LPGA action, a spectacular bunker eagle caught the attention of fans and analysts alike. Executing an eagle from a bunker requires not only technical mastery but also the ability to stay calm under pressure. The player’s shot combined perfect distance control with a delicate touch, sending the ball rolling close to the pin and ultimately securing two strokes under par for the hole.\n\n## Why Bunker Eagles Are So Impressive\n\nBunkers are designed to penalize errant shots, making recovery difficult. Unlike fairway or green-side shots, bunker shots demand a different technique: the player must strike the sand just behind the ball to lift it out cleanly. Achieving an eagle from this position means the player not only escaped trouble but did so with exceptional scoring.\n\nCurrent reading recommendations\n\n## LPGA Players Raising the Bar\n\nThe LPGA Tour continues to showcase incredible talent, with players frequently demonstrating creativity and resilience. Shots like these underline the high skill level and mental toughness required to compete at the top level. Moments like this also highlight why golf remains a sport where precision and strategy are just as important as power.\n\n## Impact on the Tournament\n\nSuch a remarkable shot can shift momentum dramatically. It energizes the player and the crowd, often influencing the dynamics of the leaderboard. For fans following the tournament, these moments are a reminder of the unpredictable and exciting nature of professional golf.\n\nBelow is the original tweet capturing this unforgettable bunker eagle, giving you a direct look at the shot that had everyone talking.\n\nComments & Questions",

        "content": "Israel has claimed that the successor to slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has likely been \"eliminated,\" while U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris called Tehran the greatest adversary of the United States.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on October 8 said that Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militant group and political party that controls much of southern Lebanon, was an \"organization without a head.\"\n\n\"Nasrallah was eliminated -- his replacement was probably also eliminated,\" Gallant **told** officers at the military's northern command center without providing details.\n\n\"There's no one to make decisions, no one to act,\" he added.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later echoed those comments, saying, \"We've degraded Hezbollah's capabilities.\"\n\n\"We took out thousands of terrorists, including Nasrallah himself and Nasrallah's replacement, and the replacement of the replacement,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nHezbollah is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, while the European Union blacklists its armed wing but not its political party. Hezbollah’s political party has seats in the Lebanese parliament.\n\nHashem Safieddine, a top Hezbollah official and a cousin of Nasrallah, was widely expected to be named to the group's top position, but his whereabouts and condition are a mystery since an Israeli strike hit a suspected Hezbollah leadership meeting on October 2.\n\nHezbollah has not commented on Safieddine's fate, although unidentified members have told various media that the group had lost contact with him since the attack.\n\nSafieddine has been declared a global terrorist by the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris **told** CBS TV's 60 Minutes program in an interview that she considered Iran to be the greatest adversary of the United States.\n\n\"Iran has American blood on their hands,\" she said. \"And what we saw in terms of just this attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles, what we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power -- that is one of my highest priorities.\"\n\nHarris -- the Democratic presidential nominee who will face Republican Donald Trump in the November 5 election -- declined to speculate on whether the United States would take military action itself should proof be uncovered that Iran is building a nuclear weapon.\n\nTehran has denied it is building such weapons and says its nuclear program is for civilian purposes.\n\nThe comments came as the battered and bloodied leadership of Hezbollah suggested it might be ready to negotiate a cease-fire with Israel\n\nDeputy leader Naim Qassem, in a televised speech, for the first time did not suggest that ending the war in Gaza was a precondition to reaching a truce with Israel in Lebanon.\n\nQassem said the group backed an effort by Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah, to reach a deal to halt the fighting.\n\nLate on October 8, the Syrian government said that seven civilians were killed in an Israeli air strike in Damascus. A war monitor said the strike targeted a building used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael did not immediately comment and the reports could not be verified.\n\n\nThe Israeli military said earlier on October 8 that it had killed another senior Hezbollah commander, a day after marking the somber anniversary of a Hamas attack on Israel that killed some 1,200 people.\n\nSuhail Husseini, who was responsible for overseeing the logistics, budget, and management of Hezbollah, was killed in a targeted attack on October 7, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.\n\n\"Husseini played a crucial role in weapon transfers between Iran and Hezbollah,\" the statement said, adding that he was also in charge of distributing advanced weapons to the group's members and for its \"most sensitive projects\" that included operations against Israel.\n\nThe IDF said Husseini was also a member of the Jihad Council, the supreme military body of Hezbollah.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from Hezbollah.\n\nThe Israeli announcement came after Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a barrage of rockets on October 7 into Israel, where President Isaac Herzog led a national moment of silence to mark the start of last year's Hamas attack, which started at Kibbutz Reim in the south of the country.\n\nHamas has been designated a terrorist organization by both the United States and the European Union.\n\nIn Washington on October 7, President Joe Biden condemned Hamas on the anniversary, while also stating again the U.S. administration's commitment to reaching cease-fire agreements to end fighting in both Gaza and Lebanon.\n\n\"On this solemn anniversary, let us bear witness to the unspeakable brutality of the October 7 attacks but also to the beauty of the lives that were stolen that day,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nIn Jerusalem, relatives of the some 100 hostages still in Hamas captivity, out of a total of 250, gathered outside Netanyahu's residence and stood in silence as a siren wailed in a gesture of protest against what relatives say is the failure of the government to secure their loved ones' release.\n\nThe conflict in Gaza is still raging while Israel is now fighting on a second front in southern Lebanon against Hezbollah.\n\n\nFollowing the October 7 attack, Israel launched a military assault on Gaza that has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas. Some 90 percent of the population of Gaza has been displaced and large areas have been destroyed by Israeli bombardments.\n\n\nThe Israeli military said on October 7 that over the past year it has bombed more than 40,000 targets in Gaza, found 4,700 tunnel shafts and destroyed 1,000 rocket launcher sites.\n\nIsrael in recent weeks has been carrying out air strikes across Lebanon, including Beirut, and has staged a ground invasion into south Lebanon in its drive to wipe out Hezbollah's capabilities and leadership.\n\nIn the attacks, Israel killed Hezbollah leader Nasrallah and dozens of other leaders of the group.\n\nOn October 6, two senior Iranian security officials told Reuters that Ismail Qaani, commander of the Quds Force -- the overseas arm of the IRGC -- had also not been heard from in recent days since traveling to Lebanon.\n\nTel Aviv’s campaign against Hezbollah prompted Iran to respond by attacking Israel with a large wave of rockets that were largely shot down by Israeli air defenses without causing substantial damage, but the attack renewed fears of a larger regional conflict.\n\nGallant on October 6 threatened Iran that it might eventually find itself looking like Beirut or Gaza -- which has also been battered over the past year -- if Tehran attempts to further harm Israel.",

Casualties reported in multiple regions.\n\nRussian forces carried out a series of precision strikes on Ukrainian military targets in several regions, according to Sergey Lebedev, coordinator of the pro-Russian underground movement in Nikolayev, as cited by RIA Novosti.\n\nLebedev reported that one of the primary strikes targeted a command bunker in the Kiev region, which allegedly housed NATO officers. He stated that there were confirmed casualties among foreign military personnel.\n\nOther strategic facilities were also hit. Near Zhulyany Airport, a workshop producing drone engines was destroyed, while in Borispol, a Ukrainian Armed Forces training camp came under attack. Preliminary reports indicate around ten people were killed and another seventeen wounded, with the injured transported to local hospitals.\n\nIn the Zaporozhye region, Russian troops eliminated at least one air defense missile launcher and struck an airfield used by Ukrainian forces to deploy drones.\n\nOdessa region was also targeted, with strikes hitting port infrastructure. According to Lebedev, a ferry carrying NATO military equipment sank following the attack, and several Romanian servicemen were among the casualties. He added that residents reported hearing the activation of what appeared to be German-made Gepard air defense systems operating from across the Romanian border.\n\nExplosions were also reported at the hydroelectric power station in Dneprodzerzhinsk, where air defense systems and Ukrainian personnel were stationed. Additional strikes in Kamenskoye and Pavlograd hit industrial and logistics sites, triggering fires and temporary power outages in the affected areas.",

        "content": "# Hezbollah leader Nasrallah dies in Israeli strike, upending region\n\nWASHINGTON − Hassan Nasrallah, the revered and reviled longtime leader of Hezbollah, was killed Friday in an Israeli airstrike, the Israeli Defense Forces said.\n\nNasrallah, \"the leader of the Hezbollah terrorist organization and one of its founders, was eliminated by the IDF,\" the Israeli military said in a statement Saturday.\n\n\"Following precise intelligence,\" the statement said, fighter jets \"conducted a targeted strike on the Central Headquarters of the Hezbollah terrorist organization, which was located underground embedded under a residential building in the area of Dahieh in Beirut.\"\n\nHezbollah confirmed Nasrallah's death, saying it would continue its battle against Israel \"in support of Gaza and Palestine, and in defense of Lebanon and its steadfast and honorable people.\"\n\n## An underground meeting, and a massive crater\n\nThe decapitation attack on Israel's strongest neighboring foe was a political earthquake for the region, threatening an armed response against Israeli and U.S. targets from Iran and its proxies in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen.\n\n\"It’s huge,\" said Mohamad Bazzi, director of the Kevorkian Center for Near East Studies at New York University. \"It’s a tremendous blow to Hezbollah. It's a blow to Iran.\"\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said Nasrallah's blood \"will not go unavenged.\"\n\nA senior member of Iran's Revolutionary Guards was also killed in the attack, Iranian media reported on Saturday.\n\nNasrallah was among the most important leaders in the Middle East, commanding tens of thousands of fighters and armed with missiles supplied by the Shia Islamist movement's patron, Iran. Hezbollah governs southern Lebanon and its nearly 1 million residents independent of the weak Lebanese government.\n\n\"The strike was conducted while Hezbollah’s senior chain of command were operating from the headquarters and advancing terrorist activities against the citizens of the State of Israel,\" the Israeli statement said.\n\nFriday's airstrike on Dahiyeh shook Beirut. A security source in Lebanon told Reuters the attack − a quick succession of massively powerful blasts − had left a crater more than 20 yards deep. It was unclear how many people were killed.\n\nIt was followed on Saturday by further airstrikes on Dahiyeh and other parts of Lebanon. Huge explosions lit up the night sky, and more strikes hit the area Saturday morning. Smoke rose over the city.\n\nThe death of the militant movement's longtime leader came after a week of Israeli attacks that Tel Aviv said were meant to neuter Hezbollah's military capabilities and allow 60,000 residents of northern Israel to return to homes evacuated due to months of rocket fire from over the Lebanon border.\n\nFor almost a year, the Iran-backed militant group has intensified firing of rockets into northern Israel. Tensions on that border have increased since the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel that killed 1,200 people. Israel responded by launching military strikes on Gaza that have killed about 40,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry.\n\nU.S. officials are concerned that a ratcheting up of tensions could lead to a broader regional conflict in the Middle East and have been trying to negotiate a cease-fire.\n\nMore than 1,500 people have been killed in Lebanon in the last week, and more than 90,000 displaced, on top of 100,000 forced to flee since October.\n\n## A key figure in the 'Axis of resistance'\n\nAmong supporters, Nasrallah has been lauded for standing up to Israel and defying the United States. To enemies, he was head of a terrorist organization and a proxy for Iran's Shia Islamist theocracy in its tussle for influence in the Middle East.\n\n\"No doubt, he is a particularly important figure,\" Bazzi told USA TODAY. \"He’s very charismatic, an excellent orator.\"\n\nStill, Bazzi said, \"His star has fallen in the Middle East since Hezbollah's involvement in the Syrian civil war,\" when Hezbollah fighters were key to the survival of Bashar al Assad's brutal government.\n\nNasrallah's regional influence has been on display over nearly a year of conflict ignited by the Gaza war, as Hezbollah entered the fray by firing on Israel from southern Lebanon in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas, and Yemeni and Iraqi groups followed suit, operating under the umbrella of an Iran-led \"Axis of Resistance.\"\n\n\"We are facing a great battle,\" Nasrallah said in an Aug. 1 speech at the funeral of Hezbollah's top military commander, Fuad Shukr, who had been killed in an Israeli strike.\n\n## Pager blasts and a change in fortune\n\nYet when thousands of Hezbollah members were injured and dozens killed, when their pagers and walkie-talkies exploded in an apparent Israeli attack last week, that battle began to turn against his group.\n\nResponding to the attacks on Hezbollah's communications network in a Sept. 19 speech, Nasrallah vowed to punish Israel.\n\n\"This is a reckoning that will come, its nature, its size, how and where? This is certainly what we will keep to ourselves and in the narrowest circle even within ourselves,\" he said.\n\nHe has not given a broadcast address since then.\n\nIsrael has meanwhile dramatically escalated its attacks, killing several senior Hezbollah commanders in targeted strikes and unleashing a massive bombardment in Hezbollah-controlled areas of Lebanon, which has killed hundreds of people.\n\nIsrael said Friday's strike also killed Ali Karki, who it identified as the commander of Hezbollah’s southern front, and other leaders.\n\nIran on Friday accused Israel of using U.S.-made \"bunker buster\" bombs in the attack.\n\n## 'Serious security breaches'\n\n\"There have clearly been serious security breaches in Hezbollah,\" Bazzi said. \"It begs the question of how and why he was moving around at this point.\"\n\n\"This is severe, decapitating in some ways.\" Still, Bazzi added, \"They are also set up − Nasrallah has made this point himself − as an organization that will continue as leaders get killed.\"\n\nRecognized even by his enemies as a charismatic orator, Nasrallah's speeches were followed by friend and foe alike.\n\nWearing the black turban of a sayyed, or a descendent of the Prophet Mohammad, Nasrallah used his addresses to rally Hezbollah's base but also to deliver carefully calibrated threats, often wagging his finger as he did so.\n\nHe became secretary general of Hezbollah in 1992 at 35, the public face of a once shadowy group founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982 to fight Israeli forces in southern Lebanon.\n\nIsrael killed his predecessor, Sayyed Abbas al-Musawi, in a helicopter attack. Nasrallah led Hezbollah when its guerrillas finally drove Israeli forces from southern Lebanon in 2000, ending an 18-year occupation.\n\nHezbollah and Israel fought to a standstill in a 2006 war.\n\n*(This story has been updated with new information and a new video.)*\n\n*Contributing: Reuters*",

        "content": "# Iran carries out a massive missile attack on Israel, expanding the Middle East conflict\n\nIran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.\n\nThe Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. Israel found itself fighting on three separate fronts on Tuesday — with Hamas in Gaza to the south, with Hezbollah in Lebanon to the north and with the Iranian missile strike from the east.\n\nAir raid sirens wailed, explosions lit up the nighttime sky and loud booms echoed throughout the country as Israeli defenses fired on the Iranian missiles. Israel's military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said most Iranian missiles were intercepted, though a small number crashed into central and southern Israel.\n\nNo Israeli deaths were reported in the airstrike, though the attacks caused some limited damage. Palestinian officials said a Palestinian man was killed by falling debris in the West Bank. Iran fired a large barrage of missiles and drones against Israel back in April. Almost all those weapons were also shot down, and no Israelis were killed in that attack either.\n\nAfter Tuesday's strike, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Security Cabinet, \"Iran made a big mistake this evening, and it will pay for it.\" He went on to add, \"Whoever attacks us, we will attack them.\"\n\nIn Washington, President Biden said, \"Based on what we know now, the attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective.\" The president added, \"Make no mistake. The United States is fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel.\"\n\nPentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said two U.S. destroyers fired a total of 12 interceptors at Iranian missiles as they headed to Israel. He said the U.S. Defense Department was still assessing whether the interceptors hit their targets.\n\nIn a separate development, two gunmen shot dead six people and injured 12 in an attack on a light-rail train in Jaffa, just south of Tel Aviv, according to Israeli authorities. Israeli police said they then shot dead the two gunmen at the scene. Israeli media reports described the gunmen as Palestinians from Hebron in the West Bank.\n\n### Escalating regional violence\n\nThe Iranian strikes come in the wake of an escalating Israeli operation against the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon, including a ground campaign launched Monday. Israel is attempting to greatly weaken the group, which has been trained and armed by Iran for four decades.\n\nIran claimed the missile attack was in response to several recent killings. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, killed last Friday in an airstrike in Beirut; the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, killed in Iran's capital, Tehran, in July; and the earlier death of an Iranian military commander.\n\nLoading...\n\nIran's mission at the United Nations said in a statement on the social media platform X that Iran carried out a \"legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime.\" The statement added that \"should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue.\"\n\nIsrael's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. A short while later, Israelis received another official notice saying they could come out of the shelters. Meanwhile, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv have been put under tight restrictions, including new limits on gatherings in any urban centers.\n\n### Iran's strike linked to wider regional conflict\n\nHezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel last Oct. 8 — one day after Hamas launched a major attack into southern Israel. Hezbollah describes its effort as an act of solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nOver the past year, Israel and Hezbollah have been firing almost every day across the Israel-Lebanon border. But the shooting remained at a relatively low level until Israel unleashed a much larger campaign two weeks ago.\n\nSince then, Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people and have forced many Lebanese civilians to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing Nasrallah and several other top officials, as well as many civilians.\n\nBack in April, an Israeli strike killed several leaders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, Syria.\n\nIran responded by attacking Israel with more than 300 drones and missiles, but nearly all were intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States. A few missiles did cause some damage. A 7-year-old girl was severely injured and a military base in southern Israel suffered minor damage, according to Israeli officials.\n\n*Hadeel Al-Shalchi reported from Tel Aviv.

        "content": "The US has begun production of interceptor missiles for Israel’s Iron Dome system. Israel immediately placed an order for $1.25 billion worth of interceptors, financed with US aid.\n\nBreaking Defense reported on this.\n\nThe American company Raytheon and Israeli firm Rafael have officially opened a new US facility to produce Iron Dome interceptors. Construction began at the end of 2023 and cost the companies $33 million.\n\nAccording to the report, the announcement came just hours after the Israeli Ministry of Defense revealed a “multi-billion dollar contract” with Rafael for the supply of new Tamir anti-air missiles.\n\n“The signing of this historic contract is a strategic step that will significantly strengthen our air defense capabilities against adversaries seeking to threaten Israel’s security,” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz shared.\n\nThe Iron Dome funding is part of an $8.7 billion aid package approved by the US Congress in April 2024, including $5.2 billion earmarked for air defense assets. The signing ceremony for the new contract took place in Tel Aviv at the Defense Ministry headquarters with US military attaché Major General Aaron Drake and key Israeli defense officials in attendance.\n\nRaytheon said it had already received a $1.25 billion contract to supply Tamir interceptors to Israel for use in Iron Dome.\n\nRafael did not clarify whether the $1.25 billion deal with R2S is part of the Ministry’s overall contract. However, a company spokesperson said that part of the Israeli Ministry of Defense’s investment is directed toward producing Tamir interceptors in the United States through R2S.\n\nIn addition to producing Tamir missiles, the new facility will also manufacture SkyHunter interceptors adapted for the US Marine Corps’ Medium-Range Intercept Capability (MRIC) system.\n\nMRIC is a new US medium-range air defense system under testing for the Marine Corps.\n\nThe system was developed to enhance air defense for Marine Corps units that may operate beyond the reach of ship-based air defense, missile defense systems, and aviation.\n\nAccording to US Navy contracting plans, an MRIC battery consists of 11 firing units. Each unit includes four trailer launchers carrying transport-launch containers for 20 missiles, along with an AN/TPS-80 radar station. Equipped with SkyHunter missiles, the system can intercept high-speed targets, including ballistic missiles, at ranges from 4 to 70 kilometers.\n\n\nПідтримати нас можна через:\n\nПриват: **5169 3351 0164 7408** PayPal - [email protected] Стати нашим патроном за лінком ⬇\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nor on ours Telegram\n\nThank you!!\n\nYou are subscribed to our newsletter",

The deal replenishes expended Tamir stocks and expands joint U.S.-Israeli manufacturing capacity at a time of sustained rocket and drone threats.**\n\nThe **Israeli Ministry of Defense** announced on 20 November 2025 that the country signed a multi-billion-dollar contract with Rafael Advanced Defense Systems to expand serial production of the Iron Dome system. The agreement, concluded by the Directorate of Defense Research and Development and the Israel Missile Defense Organization, calls for Rafael to deliver a substantial quantity of interceptors to the ministry and the Israel Defense Forces. Israeli and international reporting state that the contract is financed from an 8.7 billion dollar United States aid package approved in April 2024, including 5.2 billion dollars earmarked for air and missile defense systems such as Iron Dome, David's Sling, and the Iron Beam laser.**Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link**\n\nThe Israeli Ministry of Defense has signed a multi-billion-dollar contract with Rafael to accelerate large-scale production of Iron Dome interceptors, replenishing stockpiles after recent high-intensity engagements and expanding the system's role within Israel's layered air and missile defense network (Picture source: Rafael).\n\nIron Dome forms the lowest tier of Israel's multi-layer air and missile defense architecture, providing mobile protection against rockets, artillery, and mortars fired from roughly 4 to 70 kilometers, along with selected cruise missile, precision munition, and unmanned aircraft threats. Declared operational in March 2011 and first deployed near Beersheba, the system quickly became the principal shield for Israeli population centers and critical infrastructure against rocket fire from Hamas and southern Lebanon. In the national construct, it sits beneath David's Sling and the Arrow family, giving Israel a layered defense from low-altitude rockets up through long-range ballistic missiles.\n\nA typical Iron Dome battery consists of the EL/M-2084 S-band active electronically scanned array radar produced by Israel Aerospace Industries' Elta division, a battle management and weapon control center from mPrest, and three to four remote launcher units. Each launcher carries up to twenty Tamir interceptors, giving a battery sixty to eighty ready missiles and the ability, when properly positioned, to defend an area of about 150 square kilometers. The radar detects launches, tracks trajectories, and feeds data to the command software, which estimates impact points and authorizes fire only against projectiles predicted to strike protected zones, an approach refined over time through repeated software and algorithm upgrades rather than extensive hardware changes.\n\nAt the center of the weapon system is the Tamir interceptor, a compact missile about three meters long and 160 millimeters in diameter, weighing roughly ninety kilograms at launch. Tamir combines command guidance via data link with an onboard seeker, with open sources describing an active radar seeker and electro-optical sensors that enable high-g maneuvering during the terminal phase. It carries a blast fragmentation warhead triggered by a proximity fuze to detonate close to the incoming rocket, shell, drone, or cruise missile, a design credited with thousands of successful combat intercepts and effectiveness rates above ninety percent against threats selected for engagement.\n\nSince entering service, Iron Dome has been employed in every major round of fighting, from early operations over Gaza through the 2012 and 2014 campaigns, the May 2021 conflict, and the intense 2023 to 2025 Middle East war. During this period, Israel has faced sustained rocket, mortar, and drone fire from Gaza and Lebanon, and in April 2024, Iran and allied groups launched more than three hundred drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles toward Israeli territory in a single coordinated strike. In that event, Iron Dome operated as the lower tier of a wider defensive effort alongside David's Sling and Arrow, thinning out shorter-range and residual threats while higher-tier systems tackled long-range ballistic missiles. The volume and duration of these engagements, together with frequent smaller salvos, have raised concerns about the pace at which Tamir stockpiles can be replenished relative to operational expenditure.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the new contract functions as both replenishment and expansion. The ministry's statement highlights delivery of a substantial quantity of interceptors, while outside reporting links the order directly to the 5.2 billion dollar U.S. allocation dedicated to air and missile defense under the 8.7 billion dollar package, with Iron Dome identified as a principal beneficiary. In parallel, Rafael and Raytheon have opened an R2S joint venture facility in East Camden, Arkansas, established with a 33 million dollar investment to produce Tamir missiles for both Israeli Iron Dome batteries and the U.S. Marine Corps SkyHunter interceptor used in the Medium Range Intercept Capability program. The plant supports the Israel Missile Defense Organization within the Directorate of Defense Research and Development and is explicitly framed as part of the effort to accelerate serial production of Iron Dome interceptors, shifting a growing share of manufacturing to a joint U.S.-Israeli industrial base.\n\nThe Iron Dome expansion is also intertwined with Israel's move toward directed energy. In late 2024, the ministry signed a separate agreement worth about two billion shekels with Rafael and Elbit Systems to scale up production of the Iron Beam high-power laser, intended to intercept rockets, mortars, drones, and cruise missiles at far lower cost per engagement than missile interceptors. Israeli officials expect Iron Beam to be co-located with Iron Dome batteries and integrated into their command and control network so that the laser can handle dense short-range salvos while Tamir missiles are reserved for more demanding threats. For Army Recognition's readers, the result is clear: the latest multi-billion dollar contract locks in a multi-year production surge that restores interceptor depth after recent fighting, anchors a shared U.S.-Israeli supply chain for Tamir and SkyHunter, and reinforces Iron Dome's position as a reference system in the global short-range air defense and counter rocket, artillery, and mortar market.",

        "content": "The U.S. Space Force has awarded about a half dozen small Golden Dome contracts to build competing missile defense prototypes, kicking off a race for future deals worth tens of billions of dollars, according to two sources briefed on the matter.\n\nThe awards went to several companies including Northrop Grumman, True Anomaly, Lockheed Martin and Anduril, the sources said.\n\nThe contracts mark a significant step forward in the Pentagon's efforts to track and destroy enemy missiles, and include prototypes of space-based interceptors and related systems. While Reuters could not determine the size of the contracts, a July Pentagon presentation seen by Reuters suggested awards for interceptor contracts would be about $120,000 each.\n\nThe contracts have not yet been publicly announced, though a Space Force spokesperson confirmed the awards, declining to name the contractors. The spokesperson said that contracts under $9 million do not need to be publicly disclosed.\n\nWinners of these initial awards will compete for final production contracts that could be worth tens of billions of dollars.\n\nThe contracts will fund the development of competing prototypes for phase interceptors that will shoot down a missile as it enters space, and the fire control stations to coordinate the signals from satellites and help interceptors launch and find their targets.\n\nThe Space Force awarded Northrop Grumman and Anduril contracts valued at $10 million, according to values printed in the July Pentagon presentation, the sources said.\n\nNames of the companies that won contracts in both these award pools have not previously been reported.\n\nThe government had asked contractors to develop four different versions of interceptors to address threats at various altitudes and speeds that have yet to be awarded.\n\nA third source said the four interceptor pools may be consolidated into three.\n\nA Northrop spokesperson declined to comment. Anduril, Lockheed and True Anomaly did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe government has structured the various interceptor competitions with \"prize pools\" to incentivize rapid development. The largest pool of $340 million would be split among companies that successfully complete an on-orbit test, with first place receiving $125 million and fifth place receiving $40 million, according to the July presentation.\n\nThe ultimate prize is substantial: production contracts worth $1.8 billion to $3.4 billion annually, according to the July presentation. However, industry executives estimate it could cost between $200 million and $2 billion to build and test a single space-based interceptor prototype.\n\nThe space-based interceptor program represents a new approach to missile defense, placing weapons in orbit to destroy threats earlier in their flight path than current ground-based systems allow.\n\nAbout six months ago, Trump spoke about the project, saying that \"we helped Israel with its system (Iron Dome), which was very successful,\" and immediately emphasized: \"Our technology is much more advanced.\" He also said that \"Golden Dome will protect our homeland,\" adding that Canada wants to use the system and that the U.S. will help it.\n\nThe promise to develop a new defense system was one of Trump's campaign promises. He promised to \"build an Iron Dome over our country, a dome like you've never seen before, a state-of-the-art missile defense system that will be built entirely in America. We're going to build the biggest dome of them all.\"",

        "content": "##### October 1, 2024 | The Jerusalem Post\n\n# Israel must respond to Iran’s massive ballistic missile attack\n\n##### Iran has assumed for too long that it can wreak havoc without retribution - that needs to change.\n\n###### October 1, 2024 | The Jerusalem Post\n\n#### Israel must respond to Iran’s massive ballistic missile attack\n\n#### Iran has assumed for too long that it can wreak havoc without retribution - that needs to change.\n\nIran’s massive ballistic missile attack on Israel on October 1 is part of the Tehran regime’s attempt to make these types of attacks a new normal. They carried out a large attack in April and threatened another attack in August. This has led Israel into crisis each time as people must be prepared to go to shelters, and activities are canceled.\n\nWe have become too used to the idea that hundreds of Iranian missiles can fly through the sky of Israel. Because Israel has air defenses, these kinds of unprecedented attacks, which would usually mark the beginning of a major war, are portrayed as acceptable. Media abroad portrays them as Iran trying to “retaliate” or “even the score” or “deter” Israel. This is a false attempt to downplay the Iranian threat.\n\nIran has shown in its recent attack that it can launch 180 ballistic missiles. The previous time, in April, it used more drones than missiles. Now, it is relying on the missiles, and it has also shown it can target certain areas of Israel with them. This is a major threat to the region. It cannot go unanswered. What that means is that Iran has for too long assumed a kind of privilege where it expected to be appeased. It expects that there will be no response. Iran’s regime assumes it can send millions of Israelis to shelters and that life in Tehran will continue as normal.\n\nIran has been doing this for years. It attacked Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq energy facility in 2019 using drones and cruise missiles. It also carried out ballistic missile attacks on Erbil and other areas in the Kurdistan region of Iraq over the last several years. Iran has also launched ballistic missiles at Syria and Pakistan in January. It also attacked US forces at the Asad base in Iraq using ballistic missiles in 2020. Notice the pattern.\n\n**Why not Iran?**\n\nIran has been doing this more and more, and it always gets away with it. No one launches ballistic missiles at Iran. Iranians don’t have to flee to shelters. Iran’s regime leaders don’t have to go to a bunker. Iran feels complete privilege to do whatever it wants. It has attacked ships in the Persian Gulf; it has encouraged Hamas’ genocidal attack on October 7; it has armed Hezbollah; and it has flooded Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon with arms for proxy militias. The regime is a threat to the region and the world.\n\nIran’s attack on Israel illustrates its growing threat. This is not an acceptable trend. I saw the attack from my balcony while my family sheltered. I had to rush home when Israel’s Home Front Command said that there was a security threat. The threat caused the whole country to go to shelters.\n\nFrom my balcony, I could see the ballistic missiles flying over Jerusalem. Many seemed headed to the South. Some were intercepted. Sirens sounded across Jerusalem, those haunting sirens that cause us all anxiety. While it seems the missile threat did not cause much damage and didn’t harm many people, it is still an unacceptable way to live.\n\nThe theory that Israel should “take the win” and not respond simply because no one was injured is a false way to examine this threat. It’s like saying that since no one was injured in a mass shooting, that therefore it’s acceptable to have mass shootings. It’s a false perception that simply because a bullet hits a bullet-proof vest that therefore the person who fired the bullet should be released immediately.\n\nWe don’t view crimes that way. We don’t argue that if no one was injured, then the crime of shooting at a crowd of people didn’t happen. We don’t “take the win” and shrug our shoulders in those cases. Just because Israel has good defenses and Iran’s missiles failed to reach their targets in most cases, doesn’t mean there is no threat. People had to shelter and sit in fear. Children are traumatized.\n\nIt’s obvious that if the situation was reversed, and Israel launched 200 missiles at Iran and millions of Iranians had to seek shelter, that it would not be portrayed as acceptable. Iran is trying to create a new normal of massive ballistic missile attacks on Israel. Iran is testing Israel’s defenses. Iran is also preparing to develop a nuclear bomb. Iran is using its attacks across the region to hone its capabilities. The attacks in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria and Pakistan were not in a vacuum. They were preparations for the attacks on Israel. The fact that Iran was appeased and not stopped earlier has emboldened it.\n\nAs I stood on my balcony, the sirens sounding around me, watching the Iranian missiles fly overhead, it was clear the dangerous power Iran has unleashed. Iran is raining missiles on Israel and the region. The whole region is aflame with violence and war because of Iran. Hezbollah is a threat because of Iran. Hamas is a threat because of Iran. The West Bank is boiling over because of Iran. The Houthis are attacking Israel because of Iran. The Iraqi militias are attacking Israel because of Iran. These threats must stop, and this cannot become a new normal.\n\n*Seth Frantzman is the author of *The October 7 War: Israel’s Battle for Security in Gaza* (2024) and an adjunct fellow at The Foundation for Defense of Democracies.*",

        "content": "# U.S. Iron Dome Interceptor Production Site Opens as Israel Places Major New Order\n\nIsraeli firm Rafael has officially opened a new U.S. factory to produce Iron Dome interceptors, an announcement that came hours after Israel’s Ministry of Defense announced a “multi-billion dollar contract” to the firm for new munitions.\n\nThe Ministry of Defense said in a statement Thursday that its Director General Maj. Gen. Amir Baram had “signed a procurement order that will accelerate the production of the Iron Dome defense system.” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz added the “signing of this landmark contract represents a strategic leap forward that will significantly reinforce our air defense capabilities against adversaries who remain relentless in their efforts to threaten Israel’s security.”\n\nThe Iron Dome money comes as a result of a $8.7 billion aid package passed by the US Congress in April 2024, which included $5.2 billion for air defense assets. The signing ceremony for the new buy took place in Tel Aviv at the ministry’s headquarters with US Defense Attaché Maj. Gen. Aaron Drake along with key Israeli defense officials in attendance.\n\n…\n\n**The Iron Dome air defense system is one the lower layer of Israel’s multi-layered air defense systems, with David’s Sling and Arrow as the middle and upper tier respectively. All the systems played a key role in Israel’s last two years of multi-front war which saw thousands of rockets and drones launched at Israel. The Iron Dome has also been systematically upgraded to deal with emerging threats.**\n\n**At a Thursday briefing at JINSA on Israel’s 12-day conflict with Iran, retired U.S. General Charles Wald, noted that “the Iron Dome, fortunately, was upgraded just prior to the attacks by Iran to be able to take on larger missiles.” As such, the system is even more relevant in is role, defending against short and medium range rockets and drones.**\n\n…\n\n*Read the full article in Breaking Defense.*",

He said the military was not aware of any injuries and told Israelis about an hour after the attack was launched that it was safe for them to leave their bomb shelters.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack \"a big mistake\" and said Tehran \"will pay for it.\" He added: \"Whoever attacks us, we attack them.\"\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said he would discuss a response with Netanyahu. Asked what the response would be, Biden replied: \"That's in active discussion right now. That remains to be seen.\"\n\nHe added that the attack appears to have been \"defeated and ineffective, and this is a testament to Israeli military capability and the U.S. military\" and said the United States is \"fully supportive of Israel.\"\n\nOne Palestinian was killed by falling debris from an intercepted missile, according to the mayor of the city of Jericho in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and Israeli police reported that at least six people were killed and nine wounded in a shooting and stabbing attack in Tel Aviv.\n\nPolice said it was a \"terrorist\" attack carried out at a light rail station and the two attackers were later killed by civilians and inspectors using their own firearms. There has been no claim of responsibility.\n\nWhile the missile attack sent Israelis scurrying to take cover in bomb shelters, it prompted people in Iran to celebrate. State television broadcast images from the city of Mashhad showing people in the streets waving the yellow flag of Hezbollah and portraits of the group's slain chief, Hassan Nasrallah. Similar celebrations also took place in the capital Tehran and in several provincial cities.\n\nBiden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee in the November 5 presidential election, monitored the attack together at the White House, and Harris said afterward that Iran is a \"destabilizing, dangerous force in the Middle East.\"\n\nNational-security adviser Jake Sullivan called the attack a significant escalation by Iran but added that it was ultimately “defeated and ineffective” in part because of assistance from the U.S. military in shooting down some of the inbound missiles.\n\n\"Initial reports indicate that Israel was able to intercept the majority of incoming missiles and that there was minimal damage on the ground,\" Pentagon spokesman Major General Patrick Ryder said, noting two American destroyers fired about a dozen interceptors as part of the defensive effort.\n\nThe number of ballistic missiles fired was about twice as many as were fired in an attack on Israel earlier this year, Ryder added in a briefing with journalists. The attack in April was in retaliation for a deadly Israeli air strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus.\n\nThe Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said the missile attack on October 1 targeted three military bases around Tel Aviv. It also warned that if Israel retaliated, Tehran's response would be \"more crushing and ruinous.\" Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and the EU, praised the attack as \"heroic.\"\n\nWorld leaders urged Iran and Israel to step back from the brink and negotiate a cease-fire.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the \"broadening conflict in the Middle East\" following fighting in Gaza that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing nearly 1,200 Israelis. Guterres slammed \"escalation after escalation\" in the region.\n\n\"This must stop. We absolutely need a cease-fire,\" he said.\n\nThe UN Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on the Middle East to take place on October 2.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also called for an immediate cease-fire and condemned Iran's attack \"in the strongest terms,\" while U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the attack was \"totally unacceptable\" and should be condemned by the entire world.\"\n\nEarlier on October 1, the Israeli military said it had launched \"targeted and precise\" raids inside Lebanon in what it called a \"limited\" ground incursion that started overnight, adding that its troops were engaged in \"heavy fighting\" with Hezbollah, the militant group that controls much of the area.\n\nHezbollah is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States. The European Union blacklists Hezbollah's armed wing but not its political party, which has seats in the Lebanese parliament.\n\nIsrael has launched withering air attacks on Hezbollah in recent weeks, killing Nasrallah as well as claiming the lives of multiple Hezbollah leaders and other members of sanctioned militant groups.",

Earlier Tuesday, Israel launched what it said is a limited ground incursion in southern Lebanon.\n\nIsraelis scrambled for bomb shelters as air raid sirens sounded and the orange glow of missiles streaked across the night sky.\n\nIsraeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the country’s air defenses intercepted many of the incoming Iranian missiles, though some landed in central and southern Israel. Israel’s national rescue service said two people were lightly wounded by shrapnel. In the West Bank, Palestinian officials said a Palestinian man was killed by a missile that fell near the town of Jericho, though it wasn’t clear where the attack originated.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed late Tuesday to retaliate against Iran, which he said “made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it.”\n\nIran’s armed forces joint chief of staff Gen. Mohammad Bagheri warned that Iran would respond to action against its territory with strikes on Israel’s entire infrastructure with “multiplied intensity.”\n\nIsraeli airstrikes and artillery fire pounded southern Lebanese villages on Tuesday, and Hezbollah responded with a barrage of rockets into Israel. There was no immediate word on casualties.\n\nMoments before Iran launched its missiles, a shooting attack in Tel Aviv left at least six people dead, police said, adding that the two suspects who had opened fire on a boulevard in the Jaffa neighborhood had also been killed.\n\n## Fears of a broader conflict\n\nHezbollah and Hamas are close allies backed by Iran, and each escalation has raised fears of a wider war in the Middle East that could draw in Iran and the United States, which has rushed military assets to the region in support of Israel.\n\nIsrael and Iran have fought a shadow war for years, but rarely have they come into direct conflict.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting for Wednesday morning to address the escalating situation in the Middle East.\n\nIran launched another direct attack on Israel in April, but few of its projectiles reached their targets. Many were shot down by a U.S.-led coalition, while others apparently failed at launch or crashed in flight.\n\nWhite House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan called Iran’s missile attack a “significant escalation,” although he said it was ultimately “defeated and ineffective,” in part because of assistance from the U.S. military in shooting down some of the inbound missiles. President Joe Biden said his administration is “fully supportive” of Israel and that he’s in “active discussion” with aides about what the appropriate response should be to Tehran.\n\nIran said it fired Tuesday’s missiles as retaliation for attacks that killed leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas and the Iranian military. It referenced Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Revolutionary Guard Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, both killed in an Israeli airstrike last week in Beirut. It also mentioned Ismail Haniyeh, a top leader in Hamas who was assassinated in Tehran in a suspected Israeli attack in July.\n\nIsrael has said it will continue to strike Hezbollah until it is safe for citizens displaced from homes near the Lebanon border to return. Hezbollah has vowed to keep firing rockets into Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza with Hamas, which is also supported by Iran.\n\n## Questions raised over whether Israeli forces entered\n\nWhile Hezbollah denied Israeli troops had entered Lebanon, the Israeli army announced it had also carried out dozens of covert ground raids into southern Lebanon going back nearly a year.\n\nIf true, it would be another humiliating blow for Hezbollah, the most powerful armed group in the Middle East. Hezbollah has been reeling from weeks of targeted strikes that killed Nasrallah and several of his top commanders.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Israel warned people in southern Lebanon to evacuate to the north of the Awali River, some 60 kilometers (36 miles) from the border and much farther than the Litani River, which marks the northern edge of a U.N.-declared zone intended to serve as a buffer between Israel and Hezbollah after their 2006 war.\n\nThe border region has largely emptied out over the past year as the two sides have traded fire.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw Israeli troops operating near the border in armored trucks, with helicopters circling overhead, but could not confirm ground forces had crossed into Lebanon.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday the U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon has seen sporadic incursions by Israeli military forces, but “they have not witnessed a full-scale invasion.”\n\nAhead of the Israeli announcement of an incursion, U.S. officials on Monday said Israel had described launching small raids inside Lebanon as it prepared for a wider operation.\n\nHagari, the Israeli army spokesman, said Israel had carried out dozens of small raids inside Lebanon since Oct. 8, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel after the outbreak of the war in Gaza. He said Israeli forces had crossed the border to collect information and destroy Hezbollah infrastructure, including tunnels and weapons. Israel has said Hezbollah was preparing its own Oct. 7-style attack into Israel. It was not immediately possible to confirm those claims.\n\nHagari said Israel’s aims for its current ground offensive in Lebanon were limited. “We’re not going to Beirut,” he said.\n\nThe Israeli military was accused of lying to the media in 2021 when it released a statement implying ground troops had entered Gaza. The military played down the incident as a misunderstanding, but well-sourced military commentators in Israel said it was part of a ruse to lure Hamas into battle.\n\n## Israel strikes more targets and Hezbollah fires rockets\n\nThe Israeli military said Hezbollah had launched rockets at central Israel on Tuesday, setting off air raid sirens and wounding a man. Hezbollah said it fired salvos of a new kind of medium-range missile at the headquarters of two Israeli intelligence agencies near Tel Aviv. Hezbollah also launched projectiles at Israeli communities near the border, targeting soldiers without wounding anyone.\n\nIsrael’s statements indicated it might focus its ground operation on the narrow strip along the border, rather than launching a larger invasion aimed at destroying Hezbollah, as it has attempted in Gaza against Hamas.\n\nIsraeli strikes have killed over 1,000 people in Lebanon over the past two weeks, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry. Hundreds of thousands have fled their homes.\n\nIsrael declared war against the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials.\n\nHezbollah is a well-trained militia, believed to have tens of thousands of fighters and an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles. The last round of fighting in 2006 ended in a stalemate, and both sides have spent the past two decades preparing for their next showdown.\n\nThe group’s acting leader, Naim Kassem, said Monday that Hezbollah commanders killed in recent weeks have already been replaced.\n\nAs the fighting intensifies, European countries have begun pulling their diplomats and citizens out of Lebanon.\n\n___\n\nMroue reported from Beirut and Madhani reported from Washington.

        "content": "Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel this week, only the second time Iran has attacked Israel directly, stood out for its large scope and limited impact, analysts say.\n\nEvidence suggests that Iran used its highest-grade munitions in the attack: its quickest-to-launch and fastest-traveling missiles and a larger number of launchers than experts knew that the country had. State media also reported that Iran had used an advanced ballistic that had not been used before.\n\nBoth this week’s attack and the one that preceded it provide unprecedented windows into the extent of Iran’s capabilities, and to Israel’s ability to intercept or withstand them. Some experts said the insights call into question the value of Tehran’s enormous missile arsenal, which U.S. officials have estimated to be the largest in the Middle East.\n\n## A show of force\n\nThis week’s attack was notable in how it diverged from Iran’s first missile attack on Israel, which began on the evening of April 13. The move was retaliation for a deadly Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that took place more than two weeks before, Iranian state media outlets reported.\n\nIran used more than 300 missiles and drones in that attack: around 170 drones, according to U.S. assessments, and 150 missiles — around 30 of them cruise missiles, which are self-propelled throughout their flight and generally fly closer to the ground. The rest were ballistic missiles, which are propelled high by a rocket and use gravity to descend at high speeds.\n\nIsrael’s military said that 99 percent of the missiles and drones were either intercepted or failed. Only a handful appear to have landed in Israel, causing minimal damage.\n\nAnalysts say Iran had spent days telegraphing its intentions, allowing Israel and its allies to prepare, used slow munitions that could be picked off, and used older liquid-fueled missiles, some of which appear to have failed.\n\nEven so, analysts said the attack carried real risk. “Any time you’re launching 300 munitions at another country, you’re intending to cause some real damage,” said John Krzyzaniak, a researcher who studies Iran’s weapons programs at the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control.\n\nIf Iran’s first direct strike on Israel in April was designed as a show of force, this week it seemed to intend a far more significant blow, evidence shows.\n\nTehran’s standing had been hit by devastating Israeli attacks on its ally, Lebanon’s Hezbollah, and the ongoing war in Gaza that has largely neutralized another Iranian partner, Hamas. Iran said Tuesday’s strike was retaliation for the killings of Hasan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, in Beirut late last month, and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July.\n\n“They wanted to wash away blood with blood,” said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nThe United States publicly warned that Iran was preparing for a strike against Israel at roughly 9:30 a.m. Eastern on Tuesday. Three hours later, missiles were in the air.\n\nThe U.S. government has said that Iran launched around 200 missiles, while Israeli officials said later that 181 missiles were identified. Analysts, citing images from Iranian state media, said all appeared to be ballistic.\n\nSome analysts said that Iran may have used more modern missiles that use solid fuel, which means they can be launched quickly, without needing to be fueled first.\n\nIranian state media has reported that Iran used long-range Ghadr and Emad missiles, both also thought to have been used in April. But this time Iran also used for the first time its more advanced “hypersonic” Fattah missiles, Mehr News Agency reported.\n\nFootage of the launches released by state media and reviewed by three analysts showed the launch of the Ghadr missile. Iran also used the Kheibar Shekan 2 or the Fattah 1, which look similar at a distance, said Fabian Hinz, an Iran analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Berlin.\n\nIran unveiled its Fattah missile last year. Experts said it does not meet the same criteria as Western weapons described as hypersonic — the ability to maneuver inside the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds, five times the speed of sound, for extended periods of time — but it does have some maneuvering capability that could help evade missile defenses.\n\nWhile the use of the Fattah missiles was not confirmed by Iranian or Israeli officials, Jeremy Binnie, a Middle East analyst for Janes Defense Intelligence, said that a discarded rocket motor photographed in the West Bank could have come from either that or another modern ballistic missile called the Kheibar Shekan. Two other analysts who reviewed the imagery agreed.\n\nIranian state media reported that 90 percent of the missiles reached their target. While analysts said this was an exaggeration, evidence suggests that far more reached Israel than in April. Some experts said that Israel’s aerial defense systems may have been depleted.\n\n“This is a significant improvement for the Iranians,” Binnie said. “The extent to which this is down to the use of more ballistic missiles to saturate Israeli defenses or different types [of missiles] remains an open question.”\n\nA Washington Post analysis of satellite imagery and visuals found that at least two dozen missiles struck or came close to two military sites and one intelligence site.\n\nSeparately, a team from Middlebury Institute of International Studies published an initial analysis late Thursday that found at least 32 impact points on satellite imagery of Israel’s Nevatim Air Base in the Negev Desert, suggesting 16 percent or more of the missiles fired hit that target.\n\nOne death was reported on Tuesday: A Palestinian man in the occupied West Bank was killed by falling debris.\n\n## Hitting the limit\n\nIsrael is widely expected to respond with strikes of its own, and Iranian officials have suggested that they could respond in kind. “This is only a fraction of our power,” Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, wrote on X after Tuesday’s attack.\n\nBut Afshon Ostovar, a professor of national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in California, said Iranian threats had been made weaker by their strikes. “Iranian officials are trying to describe the hellfire they will rain down on Israel if Israel responds,” he said. “That is not as credible a threat as it might have been before.”\n\nSome analysts said that if Iran were to strike again, it is not clear whether it would could inflict more damage, while facing greater risks from Israel. An exchange could quickly escalate beyond Iran’s capabilities.\n\nIran has surpassed expectations before. Launching nearly 200 ballistic missiles in a short time frame was itself impressive, Krzyzaniak said, suggesting that Iran may have that many mobile launchers for its missiles — far more than previously estimated.\n\nBut Iran appears to have revealed the extent of its missile technology. “There’s always a chance for a surprise,” Krzyzaniak said. “But basically, I think they’ve shown us the best of what they have.”\n\nIran could change tactics, seeking to target more nonmilitary sites, which might be less protected by aerial defense systems. But experts warned strikes in heavily populated areas could cause deaths, intended or no.\n\nBallistic missiles with conventional warheads have a high margin of error, especially when fired from far away, said Jeffrey Lewis, one of the experts involved in the Middlebury assessment. He said he would be surprised if Iran’s margin of error was better than a few hundred meters, based on this week’s evidence.\n\nTehran “cannot win this fight with ballistic missile strikes against Israel,” said Ostovar. “Israel doesn’t need to fire 180 weapons to hit Iran. It can fire 10 weapons and hit Iran more effectively.”\n\nIf Tehran decides its missiles do not suffice for deterrence, some experts said Tehran could turn to riskier measures.\n\nMick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official under the Trump administration, said Iran is “looking at what comes next.”\n\n“And I think that unfortunately most countries would say: We need a nuclear deterrent,” he said.",

        "content": "Iran launched around 180 ballistic missiles toward Israel in a two-wave attack on Tuesday that U.S. and Israeli officials say was largely repelled.\n\nThe big picture: This was Iran's largest-scale attack ever against Israel. Most of the missiles were intercepted by Israel and the U.S., and there are no reports of deaths inside Israel. One Palestinian civilian was reportedly killed in the West Bank.\n\nState of play: While most missiles were intercepted, \"several hits were identified, and the damage is being assessed,\" an Israeli official said.\n\nPresident Biden and national security adviser Jake Sullivan both described Iran's attack as \"defeated and ineffective\" and said the U.S. stands with Israel.\n\nSullivan said Iran had launched almost 200 missiles but that most had been intercepted by U.S. Navy destroyers and Israel's air defense systems.\n\nWhat's next: Iran said the attack was launched in retaliation for a string of recent Israeli assassinations, but that it was now over, and that Israel would face \"a crushing defeat\" if it responds with force.\n\nIDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in televised remarks: \"We will protect the citizens of Israel. This attack will have consequences. We have plans. We will act at the time and place of our choosing.\"\n\n\"This is a significant escalation on the part of Iran. There will be severe consequences for this Iranian attack and we will work with Israel to make sure that is the case,\" Sullivan said.\n\nHow it happened: Numerous explosions were reported in central Israel, and Israeli missile defense systems lit up the sky as they activated to intercept the incoming missiles. Sirens sounded across much of Israel as the attack began.\n\nHagari said IDF missile defense systems \"made quite a few interceptions.\" He noted that several missiles hit areas in the center and the south of Israel with no casualties known to the IDF.\n\nDuring the attack, the Israeli Security Cabinet convened at the government bunker near Jerusalem, while President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris watched from the Situation Room.\n\nThe U.S. warned Israel of an imminent ballistic missile attack at around 5am ET, a senior Israeli official said. Before any missiles were launched, the White House warned Iran it would face \"severe consequences.\"\n\nIsraeli airspace was closed to all civilian flights but later reopened.\n\nThe big picture: Israel is at war with two of Iran's allied militias, Hamas and Hezbollah. Fears of a broader war involving Iran itself have been growing for weeks.\n\nIran has said it wants to avoid a regional war, but Tuesday's attack is two months in the making.\n\nIran said it was acting in retaliation for Israel's assassinations in April of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, and for the attack last week in Beirut that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and senior Iranian Gen. Abbas Nilforoushan.\n\nZoom in: The use of ballistic missiles made this a more difficult attack for Israel to defend against than the Iranian drone and missile attack last April — Iran's first-ever direct attack on Israeli territory — which was largely repelled by Israel and its partners, led by the U.S.\n\nBallistic missiles can reach Israel within 12 minutes, while drones and cruise missiles leave more time to defend against.\n\nZoom out: The warnings of an imminent attack came just hours after Israel escalated its conflict with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia, by launching a ground invasion of southern Lebanon.\n\nIran has been promising retaliation against Israel for two months, since the assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nIran had yet to respond to that attack, and also rebuffed urging from Hezbollah to launch an attack against Israel within the past two weeks, Axios reported.\n\nU.S. and Israeli officials had been concerned that the Israeli ground invasion and the assassination of Nasrallah — a longtime ally of Iran's supreme leader — would push Iran to change course and get more directly involved to save the militia it has armed and supported for decades.\n\nFlashback: Iran launched a massive drone and missile attack against Israel in April in retaliation for another Israeli airstrike that killed a top Iranian general in Syria.\n\nMost of the drones and missiles were intercepted by Israeli, U.S., British, French, Jordanian and Saudi forces outside of Israeli airspace, and there were several injuries in Israel but no fatalities.\n\nWhat to watch: Israel's retaliation for that attack was relatively small in scale, but Israeli officials made clear that this time the Israeli response will be much stronger.\n\nAn IDF official told reporters that on Tuesday night the Israeli Air Force is going to \"continue conducting powerful strikes all over the Middle East.\"\n\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated.",

        "content": "# Iran fires 181 missiles at Israel; PM: They made a ‘big mistake’ and ‘will pay for it’\n\n## IAF, along with US and Jordan, intercept most of the projectiles; 1 Palestinian killed, 2 Israelis hurt; IDF says no harm to ‘competence’ of Air Force as some missiles target bases\n\nIran fired a massive salvo of ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday night, sending almost 10 million people into bomb shelters as projectiles and interceptors exploded in the skies above.\n\nSoon after the attack, which was largely unsuccessful, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Tehran that it had made “a big mistake” and “will pay for it.”\n\nSome 181 missiles were launched in the strike, according to Israeli officials. The Israel Defense Forces said that it intercepted “a large number” of them.\n\nOne Palestinian in the West Bank was reported killed and two Israelis were injured by falling shrapnel and debris that had caused damage and started fires in the area.\n\nExplosions could be heard across much of Israel, from Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley. Reporters on state television lay flat on the ground during live broadcasts.\n\nOne rocket impacted a school in Gadera, in central Israel, and photos and videos from the scene showed severe damage to the school building, although nobody was injured. Maj. Gen. Rafi Milo, the Home Front Command chief, visited the site of the impact alongside first responders.\n\nIsrael’s air defenses were “effective,” the IDF said. The US also participated in the defense of Israel, both by detecting the threat from Iran ahead of time and intercepting some of the missiles, according to the military.\n\nThe IDF said there were “isolated” impacts in central Israel and several more impacts in southern Israel. It emphasized that there was no damage to the “competence” of the Israeli Air Force in the attack, and said the IAF’s planes, air defenses, and air traffic control were operating normally.\n\nAt a security cabinet meeting in a secure bunker near Jerusalem in the aftermath of the attack, Netanyahu warned that Tehran had made a “big mistake tonight” and vowed that “it will pay for it.”\n\nThe strike on Israel had “failed,” he said, and was “thwarted thanks to Israel’s air defense system, which is the most advanced in the world.”\n\nHe thanked the US for its support as well.\n\n“The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and our determination to retaliate against our enemies,” said Netanyahu. “[Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar and [top Hamas military commander Muhammad] Deif did not understand this, [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah and [Hezbollah chief of staff Fuad] Shukr did not understand this, and there are probably those in Tehran who do not understand this.”\n\n“They will understand,” he threatened, stressing that “whoever attacks us — we will attack him.”\n\nHe added that this had been the case wherever Israel fights “the axis of evil” — in the West Bank, Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iran.\n\nCalling for “the forces of light in the world” to unite against Tehran, the premier urged them to “stand by Israel.”\n\n“The choice has never been clearer between tyranny and freedom, between blessing and curse,” he said.\n\n“Israel is on the move, and the axis of evil is retreating,” Netanyahu insisted. “We will do everything necessary to continue this trend, to achieve all the goals of the war, primarily the return of all our hostages, and to ensure our existence and our future.”\n\nIran said it fired the missiles into Israel in retaliation for attacks that killed leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas and the Iranian military. It referenced Hezbollah leader Nasrallah and Revolutionary Guard Gen. Abbas Nilforoushan, both killed in an Israeli airstrike last week in Beirut. It also mentioned Ismail Haniyeh, a top leader in Hamas who was assassinated in Tehran in a suspected Israeli attack in July.\n\nIran’s Revolutionary Guards said they targeted three military bases.\n\nA senior Iranian official told Reuters the order to launch missiles at Israel had been made by the country’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who remains in a secure location.\n\nA previous attack using 300 missiles and drones in April — the first ever direct Iranian on Israel — was thwarted with the help of the US military and other allies. Israel responded at the time with airstrikes in Iran, but wider escalation was averted.\n\nUS President Joe Biden directed the US military to aid Israel’s defense against the Iranian attacks and shoot down missiles that targeted Israel, the White House said.\n\nBiden and Vice President Kamala Harris monitored the attack from the White House Situation Room, said the statement.\n\nA Palestinian from Gaza was reported killed by shrapnel in Jericho in the West Bank.\n\nWhile only two people were reportedly lightly wounded in Israel proper from shrapnel, videos and photos circulating on social media showed a number of craters caused by impacts.\n\nShortly after midnight, the IDF Home Front Command announced that it was easing restrictions in central Israel, the Jerusalem area, and some parts of northern Israel following the attack.\n\nIDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told reporters earlier in the night that the IAF “continues to operate at full capacity, and tonight will also continue to strike powerfully in the Middle East, as has been the case for the past year.”\n\n“The Israeli and US air defense systems operated effectively. There was close cooperation in detection and interception,” he said.\n\n“We are still investigating [the result of the attack] and do not want to give the enemy all the information,” Hagari said.\n\n“Iran carried out a serious act tonight and is pushing the Middle East to an escalation. We will act at the place and time of our choosing, in accordance with the guidance of the political echelon,” he continued.\n\n“Tonight’s event will have consequences.”\n\nIran’s Revolutionary Guards, however, said that if Israel retaliated Tehran’s response would be “more crushing and ruinous.”\n\nAmerican forces are ready to provide “additional defensive support” to Israel after helping protect it during an Iranian missile attack, a US defense official said.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin reiterated the US’s commitment to Israel’s safety in a call with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in the aftermath of the attack, Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder said during a briefing.\n\nAustin reaffirmed the US’s ironclad commitment to Israel’s defense and stressed that the US remains well-postured in the Middle East to defend American assets and to defend Israel.\n\nRyder also told reporters that Iran launched about twice as many ballistic missiles on Tuesday as it did in its previous direct attack on Israel in April.\n\nJordan’s Public Security Directorate said its air defenses intercepted missiles and drones as Iran attacked Israel, just as it had done in April.\n\n“The Royal Jordanian Air Force and air defense systems responded to a number of missiles and drones that entered Jordanian airspace,” a statement said.\n\nThere was widespread international condemnation of the strikes.\n\nHamas praised Iran’s missile attack, saying it was in revenge for the killings of Hamas leader Haniyeh and Hezbollah chief Nasrallah.\n\n“The Islamic Resistance Movement [Hamas] blesses the heroic rocket launches carried out by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran against wide areas of our occupied lands,” a statement said, adding it was “in revenge for the blood of our heroic martyrs.”\n\nIran-backed Iraqi militias said that if the US took part in “any hostile action” against Iran, then American interests in the region would be under threat.\n\nThe statement from the group calling itself the Coordination Committee for the Iraqi Resistance also warned Israel against using Iraqi airspace to retaliate against Iran, saying “all American bases and interests in Iraq and the region will be our target.”\n\nThe Iranian attack came after the IDF launched a limited ground incursion into southern Lebanon overnight Monday-Tuesday.\n\nAmid the US warnings of the imminent Iranian attack, received by Israel earlier in the day, Netanyahu spoke of “days of great challenges” ahead. In a video statement, he urged unity in Israel, and asked the public to follow the instructions of the Home Front Command.\n\nIran did not give the United States prior notice of its attack on Israel, Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York said.\n\nEarlier in the evening, the Home Front Command had issued instructions to residents of the central area of Israel, known as Gush Dan, warning them to remain “nearby” a bomb shelter or other protected area until further notice, following reports of an imminent Iranian attack.\n\nThree Israeli officials quoted anonymously by The New York Times said that Iran would likely target three military air bases, and “an intelligence headquarters north of Tel Aviv,” which it said has been evacuated.\n\nThe US embassy in Jerusalem issued a security warning telling its employees and their families “to shelter in place until further notice.”\n\nEarlier, the Pentagon said the US was boosting its forces in the Middle East by a “few thousand” troops, by bringing in new units while extending others that are already there.\n\n“A certain number of units already deployed to the Middle East region… will be extended, and the forces due to rotate into theater to replace them will now instead augment” those that are already there, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told journalists on Monday.\n\n“These augmented forces include F-16, F-15E, A-10, F-22 fighter aircraft and associated personnel,” Singh said, later adding that there will be “an additional few thousand” personnel in the region as a result.\n\nThe US Central Command announced Tuesday that three additional squadrons of warplanes were arriving in the region, while one was already present.\n\n*Agencies contributed to this report. *\n\nThe Times of Israel Community.",

        "content": "JERUSALEM — Israeli firm Rafael has officially opened a new US factory to produce Iron Dome interceptors, an announcement that came hours after Israel’s Ministry of Defense announced a “multi-billion dollar contract” to the firm for new munitions.\n\nThe Ministry of Defense said in a statement Thursday that its Director General Maj. Gen. Amir Baram had “signed a procurement order that will accelerate the production of the Iron Dome defense system.” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz added the “signing of this landmark contract represents a strategic leap forward that will significantly reinforce our air defense capabilities against adversaries who remain relentless in their efforts to threaten Israel’s security.”\n\nThe Iron Dome money comes as a result of a $8.7 billion aid package passed by the US Congress in April 2024, which included $5.2 billion for air defense assets. The signing ceremony for the new buy took place in Tel Aviv at the ministry’s headquarters with US Defense Attaché Maj. Gen. Aaron Drake along with key Israeli defense officials in attendance.\n\n“The enduring strategic partnership … continues to secure Israel’s technological edge in air defense,” the statement said. Baram added that “joint production in Israel and the United States exemplifies the potential of our technological and industrial partnership — a collaboration the Israel Ministry of Defense is eager to expand across additional systems and domains.”\n\nAlong those lines, Rafael announced on Friday that its R2S joint venture with Raytheon has officially opened its new facility in Camden, Arkansas. Raytheon also announced that the facility has received a $1.25 billion deal to begin supplying Tamir interceptors to Israel for use on Iron Dome. Rafael did not specify if the $1.25 billion deal with R2S is part of the ministry’s procurement deal, however a spokesperson did note that part of the investment from Israel’s Ministry of Defense is going towards manufacturing Tamir interceptors in the US through R2S.\n\n*RELATED: Lasers and AI: Inside Rafael’s vision of Israel’s future air defense*\n\nActing as the US prime, Raytheon is marketing Iron Dome as “SkyHunter” domestically, with hopes to win the US Marine Corps Medium-Range Intercept Capability (MRIC) program. But the facility was built with production for Israel or future foreign customers in mind.\n\n“The opening of this facility marks another meaningful step in strengthening the availability of proven air-defense capabilities for the United States and its partners,” said Yoav Tourgeman, the president and CEO of Rafael. He noted that the new facility provides a “robust American production base, ensuring that the Tamir and SkyHunter interceptors can be delivered efficiently and at scale\n\nR2S Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Casey noted that this is “the first production contract for the R2S joint venture and a major milestone for both Raytheon and Rafael.” He added that “the new Camden site is the first all-up-round production facility in the US to manufacture Tamir and SkyHunter missiles.”\n\nThe Iron Dome air defense system is one the lower layer of Israel’s multi-layered air defense systems, with David’s Sling and Arrow as the middle and upper tier respectively. All the systems played a key role in Israel’s last two years of multi-front war which saw thousands of rockets and drones launched at Israel. The Iron Dome has also been systematically upgraded to deal with emerging threats.\n\nAt a Thursday briefing at JINSA on Israel’s 12-day conflict with Iran, retired US General Charles Wald, noted that “the Iron Dome, fortunately, was upgraded just prior to the attacks by Iran to be able to take on larger missiles.” As such, the system is even more relevant in is role, defending against short and medium range rockets and drones.",

        "content": "Israel is investing quite significant funds into expanding production of Tamir missiles for the Iron Dome complex, which will be directed to their manufacturer Rafael. A corresponding agreement was signed between the country's defense ministry and the company, but without disclosing target indicators.\n\nThe only clarification is that it concerns the possibility of supplying a \"significant quantity of interceptor missiles\" for Iron Dome. And also that this money is allocated from American support, which totals $8.7 billion.\n\nRead more:Germany's Ring Exchange Strikes Again Chile Offers 30 Marders for Ukraine in Return for Air Defense\n\nAnd from this amount, $5.2 billion is intended for strengthening Israel's anti-missile programs Iron Dome, David's Sling, and the Iron Beam laser complex, whose 15-year development was successfully completed this year. It's worth adding that at the beginning of the year, on January 16, funds were allocated from this same amount for purchasing the missiles themselves.\n\nSuch an order for Rafael means that Israel has quite soberly assessed the capabilities of its anti-missile defense after recent attacks by Hamas and iran, when in case of the enemy using a large number of missiles, even saturated anti-missile defense can be pushed through. Because if the enemy has more missiles than you have interceptor missiles, it's only a matter of time.\n\nAlso, one should not be surprised that the purchase and expansion of missile production for Israel occurs at US expense. Because Israel has received direct financial aid from the US since 1946, totaling over $130 billion. And the last approved general package agreed in 2016 provides $38 billion from the US until 2028.\n\nIt’s also worth recalling that at the expense of this aid, Israel is also arming itself with additional F-35s, which the US pays for this country and even with a very significant discount for what is essentially an export contract.\n\nBut now in Washington, statements are supposedly being heard that Israel should prepare for the fact that they will no longer receive such aid from the US. And after 2028, the countries should transition to partnership terms. At the same time, Tel Aviv supposedly wants to negotiate receiving not 10-year, but immediately 20-year guarantees of receiving aid.\n\nAt the same time, such insider information is already indirectly confirmed by the fact that Washington approved the sale of F-35s to Saudi Arabia, which may receive them together with revolutionary wingman drones from General Atomics. And this means liquidation of Israel's technological advantage in the region, which was the foundation of its defense capability together with very broad US support.\n\nRead more:1369 Days of russia-Ukraine War – russian Casualties in Ukraine",

        "content": "# Iran’s missile attack against Israel: What we know and what comes next\n\n*Israel promises to retaliate after barrage of Iranian missiles fired in response to killings of Hamas, Hezbollah leaders.*\n\nIran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in the latest escalation amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.\n\nIran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it fired missiles at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.\n\nAlarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.\n\nIsrael and its top ally, the United States, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.\n\nThe Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.\n\nHere’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.\n\n\n\n## What happened?\n\n- The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.\n- The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.\n- The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.\n- The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.\n- US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.\n- “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.\n- Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.\n\n\n\n## What was the attack in response to?\n\n- The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.\n- Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.\n- Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.\n- The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.\n- Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more fears of an all-out war.\n\nWestern hypocrisy is not just outrageous, but extremely dangerous.\n\n\nWestern States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region.\n\nIran has an inherent… pic.twitter.com/vVGHcvKgwt— Javad Zarif (@JZarif) October 1, 2024\n\n\n## How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?\n\n- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.\n- Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.\n- Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. “Let Netanyahu know that Iran does not seek war, but it stands firmly against any threat,” he wrote. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”\n- Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”\n- Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.\n- The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.\n- The Pentagon also said US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. It did not say what those consequences would be.\n- German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the country had warned Iran against “dangerous escalation”, which she said was “driving the region further to the brink of the abyss”.\n- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned “the broadening of the Middle East conflict with escalation after escalation”. In a post on X, he wrote: “This must stop. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”\n\nI condemn the broadening of the Middle East conflict with escalation after escalation.\n\nThis must stop.\n\nWe absolutely need a ceasefire.\n\n— António Guterres (@antonioguterres) October 1, 2024\n\n\n## What comes next?\n\n- Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.\n- Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.\n- Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.\n- Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy. “This will not stop without the United States putting its foot down and saying, ‘We will not send more weapons to Israel. We will not fund and aid Israeli crimes,'” he said.\n- Omar Rahman, a fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said “there is no question” that Israel will respond. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.\n- Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through its actions over the past several months. “Israel is capable of massive destruction, as we’re seeing in Lebanon. It’s capable of huge intelligence feats and waging really destruction warfare. Iran, I think, has tried to avoid that, but it’s on the path to some type of war with Israel.”",

        "content": "Nestled between the Caerneddau mountains and the Afon (River) Conwy, the small village of Dolgarrog in north Wales looks peaceful. But the huge hydro-electric pipes that run down the hillside are a constant reminder of the village’s history, and of how the same source of power that once brought prosperity also unleashed disaster.\n\nOn November 2 1925, the dam at Llyn Eigiau burst. A torrent of water and boulders thundered down the valley, sweeping through the northern part of Dolgarrog and destroying the small settlement of Porth Llŵyd. Sixteen people were killed.\n\nOne hundred years later, Dolgarrog’s story is not just one of tragedy. The village has become what its residents call a living memorial. It’s a place where disaster is not only remembered, but woven into the landscape, the law and the community’s sense of itself.\n\nAt 8pm on that night, the inhabitants of Dolgarrog felt the force of a catastrophic sequential engineering failure in the mountains above.\n\nTwo reservoirs, Llyn Eigiau and lower Coedty, supplied electricity to the local aluminium works, an industry that sustained the village. But the upper dam at Eigiau had been built on a foundation of glacial clay and boulders. After a dry summer, the clay had cracked. When autumn rains came, water seeped through. The dam wall gave way, unleashing a surge down the afon Porth Llŵyd.\n\nThis flood rapidly reached the lower Coedty dam, overwhelming its embankment. As the second dam failed, the water rushed like a massive tsunami wave down the steep gorge of afon Porth Llŵyd. Ripping out the hydro-electric pipeline, it created a deadly flow of water, debris and boulders that destroyed homes, and swept villagers into the afon Conwy.\n\n## From local tragedy to national protection\n\nThe Dolgarrog disaster was not the first dam failure in the UK, but it was the one that forced government action. Public outrage over the deaths of 16 villagers led directly to the Reservoirs (Safety Provisions) Act 1930, the first law in the UK to regulate dam safety.\n\nFor the first time, large reservoirs had to be inspected and supervised by qualified, independent engineers. This ended the era when private companies could self-regulate. It marked a major shift in how the UK governed risk and infrastructure.\n\nThe event was codified into national law and updated in 1975. It created an invisible, yet mandatory, safety structure that continues to protect people today.\n\nIf the law is an unseen memorial, the land around Dolgarrog is a visible one. The remnants of the Llyn Eigiau dam wall still stand, a stark reminder of the engineering flaws that caused the disaster.\n\nDownstream toward the Coedty dam, the torn-up peat moorland is barely visible. But the afon Porth Llŵyd gorge still shows the impact of the powerful flood, constrained by its bedrock walls. As the flood waters thundered down the gorge, they shattered, split and tore at the bedrock walls, ripping huge boulders from their rest.\n\nThe boulders dumped at the gorge’s outlet, formed a huge fan of rock debris still visible at the roadside – a chilling, preserved record of the suffering.\n\nThat landscape tells a story, not just of destruction but of recovery. The village’s memorial walk, created in 2004 around the boulder field, traces the path of the flood and symbolises the community’s ability to reclaim the space. It is both a site of reflection and an everyday walking route. This is cultural resilience and proof that remembrance and daily life coexist.\n\nDisasters are not just events of the past: shape how we individually and collectively experience places, politics and society. Dolgarrog’s residents are marking the centenary with a programme of events under the banner “Dolgarrog Past, Present and Future”. These include commissioned art, musical performances, history projects and a lantern parade – acts of remembrance that also look forward.\n\n## Lessons for today\n\nThe lessons of Dolgarrog are as urgent now as they were a century ago. In an age of climate change, when extreme rainfall and flood risks are rising, the need for strong safety standards and accountable infrastructure has never been greater.\n\nThe 1925 disaster shows why state oversight of private infrastructure is vital when public lives depend on it. It also offers a model of resilience, one that is legislative as well as communal.\n\nA hundred years on, the memory of the 16 villagers who died is not only preserved in stone and ceremony, but in the law itself, and in the ongoing safety of every major reservoir across the UK. Dolgarrog remains a living memorial to both the dangers of neglect and the power of collective renewal.",

        "content": "**In a nutshell:** Norwegian authorities have officially attributed a recent cyberattack on a dam in Bremanger, Norway, to Russia, raising concerns over sabotage targeting critical infrastructure across Europe. The incident marks the first time Oslo has formally linked such an attack to pro-Russian actors.\n\nIn April, hackers remotely accessed the Bremanger dam's digital controls, which manage fish farming operations, and opened a valve. Reuters notes that the attack released 132 gallons of water per second for four continuous hours before authorities detected and stopped the breach.\n\nWhile authorities report that no injuries or material damage resulted from the two-million-gallon deluge, intelligence agencies said the operation was part of a broader campaign aimed at intimidating and unsettling the general population\n\n\"Our Russian neighbour has become more dangerous,\" said Beate Gangås, head of Norway's Police Security Service, who spoke at a briefing on hybrid attacks.\n\nTechnical evidence of the attack appeared in a three-minute video posted to Telegram, watermarked with identifiers of a pro-Russian cybercriminal group. Police attorney Terje Nedrebø Michelsen confirmed the video's authenticity to the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), noting that while similar propaganda has circulated on social media, this incident represents the first confirmed breach of Norway's water infrastructure since 2022.\n\nKripos, Norway's organized crime unit, told national newspaper Aftenposten that the group behind the attack consists of multiple affiliated actors who have carried out several cyber operations against Western businesses in recent years. The authorities did not provide further details, leaving the specific identities of those involved unclear and underscoring the challenges of attributing cyberattacks with certainty.\n\nWestern intelligence officials have warned that sabotage campaigns attributed to Russia are becoming increasingly reckless, citing incidents of vandalism, arson, attempted assassination, and cyberattacks since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Last year, Britain's MI6 chief, Richard Moore, described Russia's actions as a \"staggeringly reckless campaign\" intended to deter European support for Ukraine, a claim Moscow continues to deny.\n\nThe Russian embassy in Oslo quickly rejected the accusations, calling them \"unfounded and politically motivated\" in an emailed response to Reuters. It also claimed that allegations of Russian sabotage represented a \"mythical threat\" concocted by Norwegian authorities in their annual February security report.\n\nNorway is a leading gas exporter that relies primarily on hydropower for electricity and shares a 123-mile Arctic border with Russia. Intelligence services have repeatedly warned of risks to national infrastructure and power generation, highlighting the growing sophistication of foreign cyber operations. Gangås told NRK that state actors often use proxy groups to demonstrate their capabilities and then publicize these actions online, as if to say, \"look what we can do if we want to.\"\n\nAt a recent briefing titled \"Hybrid attacks against Norway: are we at war?\", Gangås urged the public to stay vigilant, emphasizing that such cyber threats are likely to become more frequent in Norway and across Europe.\n\n\"I want Norwegians to be prepared,\" she said.",

        "content": "# Over 200 dead after flooding sweeps across parts of Spain during historic rains\n\n## The mountain town of Chiva, west of Valencia, was drenched by 19.33 inches of rain in just eight hours, according to Spain’s government meteorological agency.\n\n**VALENCIA, Spain** – A catastrophic flash flood has claimed over 200 lives in Spain's Valencia region following torrential and historic rains that left roads and towns underwater, according to authorities.\n\nAt least 202 lives have been lost with most reported in Valencia, according to the town's Emergency Coordination Center. The rise in the death toll marks the worst flooding disaster in Europe since 2021, when nearly 200 people perished, primarily in Germany.\n\nThe government conducted nearly 270 rescues on Wednesday – 70 via air evacuation and 200 ground rescues, Mazón said. Authorities also said there are no longer any urban areas that emergency services can't access.\n\n**WATCH: WOMAN, PETS RESCUED FROM RUSHING FLOODWATER IN SPAIN**\n\nSince Monday, Valencia's emergency number – 112 – has received nearly 5,000 calls related to DANA, according to the Emergency Coordination Center.\n\n**WHAT MAKES A 'DANA' STORM LIKE THE ONE CAUSING DEADLY FLOODING IN SPAIN?**\n\n\"Alongside the Queen, we want to express our condolences to all families that have lost loved ones,\" Spain's King Felipe VI said Wednesday at the Gando Spanish Air Force Base in Gran Canaria. \"In some cases, they don’t know yet what has happened to their relatives.\"\n\nThe monarch said there was extensive damage to infrastructure and the personal belongings of so many people in the Valencia, Andalusia and Castilla la Mancha regions.\n\n\"There are still difficulties accessing some towns and locations,\" he said. \"There isn’t yet complete information of the full extent of the damage and the number of possible victims.\"\n\nAs a potent storm system, known locally as a DANA storm, spun up the eastern coast of Spain from Monday into Tuesday, strong moisture-laden winds slammed into the mountains west of Valencia, dropping torrential rains for hours across the waterlogged European region.\n\nSpain's weather agency, AEMET, issued a red alert for Valencia, a crucial citrus-producing region, as torrential rains drenched the area.\n\nThe video below, captured by Lucia Beamud in the town of La Torre, shows dozens of cars piled on top of one another or submerged in muddy waters. Beamud said the scene was \"devastating, absolutely indescribable.\"\n\nThe mountain town of Chiva, west of Valencia, was drenched by 19.33 inches of rain in just eight hours, according to AEMET. An incredible 13.55 inches of that fell in a mere four hours, with 6.5 inches pouring down in a single hour.\n\nWater rushed down the mountainsides, quickly overwhelming rivers and towns with raging waters.\n\nGovernment officials urged residents to seek higher ground and stay on the upper floors if possible. Video from Spain’s civil defense showed some water rescues conducted by helicopter.\n\nAccording to the Spanish prison union Acaip-UGT, the storm created a challenging situation for 140 essential workers at the Picassent Penitentiary and the CIS Torre Espioca, which houses over 2,000 inmates. The employees have been on duty for more than 24 hours, trapped by road closures and blocked access.\n\nFootage released by the Spanish Ministry of Defense shows rescue efforts, destroyed roads and flooded houses in Utiel, one of the areas hardest hit by the flooding.\n\n\"Evacuation work, the search for missing persons, and bilge removal are scheduled to continue today,\" the ministry wrote on X.\n\nJavier Ballesteros, who captured the footage below in Utiel, said on national TV that the woman seen in the video \"had a dog and cats\" and that the situation was \"critical\" until they managed to get a helicopter to her.\n\n\"The woman was asking us to call emergency services, but the line was collapsed,\" Ballesteros said. \"Water kept rising and was getting above her waist. She was holding a dog, but we know she had multiple cats that were possibly in those bags she was carrying.\"\n\nMembers of Spanish military emergency unit rescued an elderly couple in the devastated town of Letur, in Castille La Mancha region on Wednesday. Encarna Rivero, 88, and her husband Jose Tomas, 89, were assisted after being stranded at a neighbor's home in Albacete.\n\nThe severe weather also brought reports of tornadoes and large hail.",

        "content": "# NPPD to pay $2.5 Million to Family of Dam Collapse Victim\n\nBy Bill Kelly , Senior Reporter/Producer Nebraska Public Media\n\nJan. 26, 2022, 8:49 p.m. ·\n\n#### Listen To This Story\n\nThe Nebraska Public Power District has agreed to pay $2.5 Million to the family of Kenny Angel. He died when Spencer Dam on the Niobrara River collapsed and flooded the family's property in March 2019.\n\nIn their lawsuit filed in Holt County District Court, the family blamed his death on the negligence of NPPD and the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources in failing to maintain the 93-year-old structure and failing to warn the public about the risk the dam posed the community.\n\nAttorney Michael Coyle represented Angel's estate, his wife, and others in the family who shared ownership of the property. Coyle told Nebraska Public Media News, \"we believe NPPD and the Nebraska DNR could have done more and taken steps to have avoided the failure of the dam in the first place.\"\n\nThe tragedy unfolded during the historic \"bomb cyclone\" that slammed northeast Nebraska with record flooding. Heavy rains inundated the frozen Niobrara, overwhelming the old dam. The property owned by the Angel family included a small tavern, a campground and concert stage, and the home where Kenny Angel was staying that night. After days of searching for Angel, he was presumed dead.\n\nThe floodwaters receded, showing the property scoured of all buildings and vegetation. The force of the flood rerouted the river channel over the Angel property.\n\nIt is unclear at the time if Angel had been warned the dam had been breached and was at risk of total failure.\n\nDating back to the 1970s, state inspectors listed Spencer Dam as a \"significant hazard\" but not life-threatening. A 2020 study completed by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, an independent engineering group, found the state underestimated the risks of ice accumulating behind the dam.\n\n\"The settlement on behalf of the angel family is an important step towards healing from a real tragedy for this family,\" Coyle said.\n\nThe NPPD board of directors approved the $2.5 million settlement at its January meeting. In a prepared statement, the utility said \"the settlement is not an admission of liability\" and approved \"to avoid additional expense.\"\n\nThe case was set to go to trial next month. The presiding District Court judge was advised the negotiated settlement ended NPPD's involvement in the lawsuit.\n\nThere has been no settlement with the state of Nebraska over its role in the Spencer Dam disaster, and that case could still go to trial.\n\nIn 2015, NPPD announced it would close the century-old hydroelectric dam, transferring ownership to the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources. Last year, NPPD received $50 Million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to remove the remaining structure and debris from the Niobrara River. The utility's spokesperson wrote in an email once state officials approve plans for the project, the utility will work with other government agencies to move forward with decommissioning the shattered hydroelectric plan.",

        "content": "# Devastating rainfall hits Spain in yet another flood-related disaster\n\nRecord-breaking rainfall and flash floods have hit Spain, causing many dozens of casualties and massive disruption and economic losses in the latest of a series of flooding disasters that have hit communities around the world. It underlines why the top priority of the WMO community is to save lives as climate change super-charges extreme weather.\n\nThe Valencia region was worst affected, with many places receiving more than 300 l/m². On 29/30 October, a weather station in Chiva received 491 l/m² in just eight hours - the equivalent of a year's worth of rainfall, according to AEMET - Agencia Estatal de Meteorología.\n\nA massive rescue and relief operation was mounted as the reported death toll topped more than 200. Images showed people swept away in cars and raging torrents of deadly water. Tens of thousands of people in Valencia were without power and transport was disrupted. The Spanish government declared three days of national mourning.\n\nAEMET, which is the official source of authoritative warnings in Spain, issued numerous warnings under the Common Alerting Protocol. This is a standardized message format designed for all media, all hazards, and all communication channels. That is, a universal format for emergency alerts, ensuring critical information reaches everyone.\n\nWMO works with its Members, the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services, to ensure that timely, accurate forecasts reach people in time and lead to early action. Our core mission is to save lives and livelihoods and this is what drives the international Early Warnings For All initiative.\n\nOther parts of Europe have also been badly hit by floods this year. In mid-September 2024 a very large region in Central Europe experienced very heavy rainfall, breaking local and national rainfall records.\n\n**Role of Climate Change**\n\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, extreme weather events causing highly impactful floods and droughts have become more likely and more severe due to anthropogenic climate change. And this has been borne out by repeated events.\n\n“As a result of rising temperatures, the hydrological cycle has accelerated. It has also become more erratic and unpredictable, and we are facing growing problems of either too much or too little water. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture which is conducive to heavy rainfall,\" said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.\n\nThe phenomenon which hit Spain – known as Isolated Depression at High Levels, or DANA in Spanish – often occurs during the autumn season because the remaining warm surface heat from summer meets a sudden cold invasion aloft from the polar regions. This leads to what meteorologists used to call '''a cut-off system'' with low-pressure values that persist over a few days and rotating over the concerned region. It also impacted southern France.\n\n“The presence of warm air near the surface being fueled by excessive moisture from the still-warm Mediterranean Sea and the instability generated by the conflict with cold air in the upper atmosphere leads to large convective clouds with heavy downpours and sudden flash floods,” says Omar Baddour, chief of Climate Monitoring at WMO.\n\n“Climate change is expected to make these systems more intense because of warmer sea waters and increasing moisture in the atmosphere,” he said.\n\nFor each 1°C of warming, saturated air contains 7 percent more water vapour on average. Every additional fraction of warming therefore increases the atmospheric moisture content which in turn increases the risk of extreme precipitation events.\n\n## World Weather Attribution\n\nClimate scientists at World Weather Attribution – which includes experts from National Meteorological and Hydrological Services issued a paper on 31 October: Ten years of rapidly disentangling drivers of extreme weather disasters. It traced how the science of attribution has progress sufficiently to analyse the role of climate change in individual events.\n\nIn a rapid analysis on Spain, the group estimated that the rainfall was about 12% heavier and twice as likely compared to the 1.3°C cooler preindustrial climate. The conclusions were well aligned with previous attribution studies on heavy rainfall in Europe, such as Storm Daniel and Storm Boris.\n\nThe World Weather Attribution scientists have issued other studies which found that climate change increased the intensity of rainfall and impact of flooding disasters in the Sahel and West Africa, East Africa, Asia (Nepal, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan) and southern Brazil this year.\n\nHowever, the studies found that many other factors including urbanization, land and water management and poverty also played a role in individual disasters.\n\nWMO’s State of the Global Climate 2024 Update, which will be published at the UN Climate Change Negotiations COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, will present details of some of the worst extreme events this year and their impacts.\n\n- WMO Member:\n- Spain\n\n- Region:\n- Region VI: Europe",

        "content": "Catastrophic flooding in Michigan yesterday was a harbinger of climate change as Rust Belt cities are thrust into the crosshairs of intensifying disasters, experts say.\n\nThe dangers of extreme weather, like the deluge in Midland, are rising in frequency and intensity across the Midwest. It speaks to underlying climate conditions such as heavier downpours that drive up the risk of flooding, experts say.\n\n“This is a tragic event for Midland, and I don’t want to belittle it,” said Drew Gronewold, a hydrologist and associate professor of environment and sustainability at the University of Michigan. “But it’s important that we broaden the context. This entire region is saturated right now, and we have been seeing this wet cycle in the Upper Great Lakes for five years.”\n\n## On supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nIn Midland’s case, nearly 5 inches of rain fell across a region that couldn’t absorb it, leading the Tittabawassee River to breach a hydroelectric dam and overtop another. The larger structure, called Edenville Dam, lost its operating license in 2018 for noncompliance of federal rules; there were concerns it could not withstand a major flood.\n\nThe torrent forced roughly 10,000 people to evacuate and inflicted extensive damage on property and infrastructure. It also flowed through a sprawling Dow Chemical Co. complex and adjacent Superfund site along the Tittabawassee, where Dow dumped liquid wastes into the river. A Dow spokesman said in a statement that the company was working to contain floodwater on its property.\n\nRichard Norton, a professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Michigan, said extreme weather events in older cities like Midland “highlight how much added risk we’re facing because of our industrial past, which placed so many high-risk critical facilities and high-contamination industrial sites so close to waterways now at increased risk of flooding. It’s a double whammy.”\n\nNorton suggested that the probability of extreme events will increase.\n\nWhile Midland’s flood “is about the most extreme ... a community might experience, they will become much less extreme over time — both in terms of how frequently they happen and how damaging they are when they do happen,” he said.\n\nYet even as changing climate conditions undergirded nearly every component of this week’s disaster, elected officials and residents often don’t see the connection to rising temperatures, experts say.\n\n“This is historic for us. People think they’ve dealt with the same flood over and over again, but these are bigger floodwaters than we ever could have imagined,” said Selina Tisdale, community affairs director for the city of Midland (*Greenwire*, May 20). “I think if people underestimated or thought they knew what they were dealing with, this may have caught them a little off guard.”\n\nAt a press briefing last night, Midland County Administrator Bridgette Gransden referred to the disaster as “a 500-year flood” and that officials “couldn’t have predicted exactly what has happened here today.” The county did perform a recent disaster exercise based on a dam failure at Edenville.\n\nJenifier Boyer, the county’s emergency management coordinator, said Midland’s hazard mitigation plan accounts for a variety of events, including floods. But to date, climate change has not been factored into risk management planning. Boyer said climate will be a focus of an upcoming review of the plan.\n\n“Part of the reason why we started doing a lot of this [disaster] exercising and reviews is because we have been seeing more significant heavy rain events and they have been very widespread,” she said. But, she added, “There’s nothing we can do about them. It’s just part of Mother Nature.”\n\nBut experts and environmental groups say communities like Midland must accept the realities of climate change and its role in worsening disasters.\n\n“This is not an isolated incident,” Bob Irvin, president and CEO of the nonprofit group American Rivers, said in a statement. “Climate change is bringing more severe flooding, at a time when our nation’s infrastructure is crumbling.”\n\n*Reprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&E News.

        "content": "SANFORD, Mich. (WJRT) - There was no significant change with the status of the Sanford Dam Wednesday evening since its initial breach on Tuesday.\n\nWater is running over the failing dam and the earthen part is washed out, but officials say the structure is still there.\n\n\"Water has gone over the dike and around the dike. The plug is out at Sanford, so a little water is going through but the structure remains there, which is different than Edenville,\" said Midland County Controller/Administrator Bridgette Grandsen.\n\nABC12 drone video captured just how extensive the damage is for the residents of Sanford. Midland City Manager Brad Kaye says a bad situation could become worse if the entire structure were to collapse.\n\n\"There would be a higher surge that would come down the river and that could raise the level much more quickly than what we're seeing right now, so it is dangerous,\" Kaye said.\n\nThe images were just as gripping on the ground. Beyond the broken dam, there are leaning light poles and mangled buildings. Underneath the water, however, it's still the place where Marissa Zajac has fond memories.\n\n\"And that's why I'm trying to, like, capture all of it. So in years to come I can be like, yep, I lived through that,\" Zajac said.\n\nShe lived through it and, thankfully, so did everyone else. Zajac took photographs of Center and Cass streets where by early evening Wednesday the sidewalk was starting to show itself again as water receded.\n\nArt Straight told ABC12 the water overtook children's baseball fields and some of the places the holds close to his heart.\n\n\"Fished all my life right on the river in front of the dam, and as I can tell right now, most of the buildings down here are damaged beyond repair or gone,\" Straight said.\n\nMeanwhile, Midland County and city are relying on \"invaluable\" film of the dams and surrounding structures from Michigan State Police helicopters.\n\n\"I never thought anything like this would happen here,\" Straight said.\n\nHe's ready to lend a hand if needed.\n\n\"If they need help, call. This is a working community, everybody helps everybody,\" Straight said.\n\nThe surging waters displaced families and some of their possessions, but the 500-year flood also has taught Zajac a valuable lesson.\n\n\"I'd say appreciating what you have and when you have it because you never know when you just lose everything,\" Zajac said.",

        "content": "# Unprecedented flooding in Spain kills at least 158 people\n\nBARRIO DE LA TORRE, Spain — Crews searched for bodies in stranded cars and sodden buildings Thursday as people tried to salvage what they could from their ruined homes following monstrous flash floods in Spain that claimed at least 158 lives, with 155 deaths confirmed in the eastern Valencia region alone.\n\nMore horrors emerged from the debris and ubiquitous layers of mud left by the walls of water that produced Spain's deadliest natural disaster in living memory. The damage recalled the aftermath of a tsunami, with survivors left to pick up the pieces as they mourn their loved ones.\n\nCars were piled on one another like fallen dominoes, uprooted trees, downed power lines and household items all mired in mud that covered streets in dozens of communities in Valencia, a region south of Barcelona on the Mediterranean coast.\n\nAn unknown number of people are still missing and more victims could be found.\n\n“Unfortunately, there are dead people inside some vehicles,” Spain’s Transport Minister Óscar Puente said early Thursday before the death toll spiked from 95 dead late Wednesday night.\n\nRushing water turned narrow streets into death traps and spawned rivers that tore through homes and businesses, sweeping away cars, people and everything else in its path. The floods demolished bridges and left roads unrecognizable.\n\nLuís Sánchez, a welder, was one of the lucky ones when the storm turned the V-31 highway south of Valencia city into a floating graveyard strewn with hundreds of vehicles. He said he saved several people.\n\n“I saw bodies floating past. I called out, but nothing,” Sánchez said. “The firefighters took the elderly first, when they could get in. I am from nearby so I tried to help and rescue people. People were crying all over, they were trapped.”\n\nRegional authorities said late Wednesday it seemed no one was left stranded on rooftops or in cars in need of rescue after helicopters saved some 70 people. The ground crews, however, were far from done.\n\n“Our priority is to find the victims and the missing so we can help end the suffering of their families,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said after meeting with regional officials and emergency services in Valencia on Thursday, the first of three official days of mourning.\n\n### Railways and farms damaged\n\nSpain’s Mediterranean coast is used to autumn storms that can cause flooding, but this was the most powerful flash flood event in recent memory. Scientists link it to climate change, which is also behind increasingly high temperatures and droughts in Spain and the heating up of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nHuman-caused climate change has doubled the likelihood of a storm like this week’s deluge in Valencia, according to a rapid but partial analysis Thursday by World Weather Attribution, comprising dozens of international scientists who study global warming’s role in extreme weather.\n\nThe greatest pain was concentrated in Paiporta, a community of 25,000 next to Valencia city where mayor Maribel Albalat said Thursday that not fewer than 62 people had perished.\n\n“(Paiporta) never has floods, we never have this kind of problem. And we found a lot of elderly people in the town center,” Albalat told national broadcaster RTVE. “There were also a lot of people who came to get their cars out of their garages ... it was a real trap.’\n\nWhile the most suffering was inflicted on municipalities near the city of Valencia, the storms unleashed their fury over huge swaths of the south and eastern coast of the Iberian peninsula. Two fatalities were confirmed in the neighboring Castilla La Mancha region and one in southern Andalusia.\n\nThe regional president for Castilla La Mancha, Emilion García-Page, said that at least one Guardia Civil police officer was among several missing people in the town of Letur.\n\nHomes were left without water as far southwest as Malaga in Andalusia, where a high-speed train derailed on Tuesday night although none of the nearly 300 passengers were hurt.\n\nGreenhouses and farms across southern Spain, known as Europe’s garden for its exported produce, were also ruined by heavy rains and flooding. The storms spawned a freak tornado in Valencia and a hail storm that punched holes in cars in Andalusia.\n\nHeavy rains continued Thursday farther north as the Spanish weather agency issued alerts for several counties in Castellón, in the eastern Valencia region, and for Tarragona in Catalonia, as well as southwest Cadiz.\n\n“This storm front is still with us,” the prime minister said. “Stay home and heed the official recommendation and you will help save lives.”\n\n### The search goes on amid the destruction\n\nOver 1,000 soldiers from Spain’s emergency rescue units joined regional and local emergency workers in the search for bodies and survivors. The soldiers had recovered 22 bodies and rescued 110 people by Wednesday night.\n\n“We are searching house by house,” Ángel Martínez, with a military emergency unit, told Spain’s national radio RNE from the town of Utiel, where at least six people died.\n\nSome 150,000 people in Valencia were without electricity on Wednesday, but roughly half had power by Thursday, Spanish news agency EFE reported. An unknown number did not have running water and were relying on whatever bottled water they could find.\n\nThe region remained partly isolated with several roads cut off and train lines interrupted, including the high-speed service to Madrid. Officials said that damaged line won’t be repaired for two to three weeks.\n\nA man wept as he showed a reporter from national broadcaster RTVE the shell of what was once the ground floor of his home in Catarroja, south of Valencia. It looked as though a bomb had detonated inside, obliterating furniture and belongings, and stripping the paint off some walls.\n\nThe chaos also prompted some to smash and grab goods. The National Police made 39 arrests on Wednesday for looting stores in areas affected by the storms. The Civil Guard deployed officers to stop the looting of homes, cars and shopping malls.\n\n### Officials questioned over late flood warnings\n\nThe violent weather event surprised regional government officials. Spain’s national weather service said it rained more in eight hours in the Valencian town of Chiva than it had in the preceding 20 months, calling the deluge “extraordinary.”\n\nYet the relative calm of the day after also gave time to reflect and question the official response. The Valencian regional government is being criticized for not sending out flood warnings to people’s mobile phones until 8 p.m. on Tuesday, when the flooding had already started in some parts and well after the national weather agency had issued a red alert for heavy rains.\n\nAndreu Salom, mayor of the Valencian village of L’Alcudia, told RTVE that his town lost at least two residents, a daughter and her elderly mother who lived together, and that police were still searching for a missing truck driver.\n\nHe also complained that he and his townsfolk had no warning of the disaster that struck when the Magro River burst its banks on Tuesday evening.\n\n“I myself was on my way to check the river level because I had no information,\" Salom said. \"I went with the local police but we had to turn back because a tsunami of water, mud, reeds and dirt was already entering the town.”\n\nMari Carmen Pérez said by phone from Barrio de la Torre, a suburb of Valencia city, that her phone buzzed with the flood warning after the rushing water had already forced open the front door and filled the first floor, forcing her family to flee upstairs.\n\n“They didn’t have any idea of what was going on,” Pérez, a cleaner, said. “Everything is ruined. The people here, we have never seen anything like this.”\n\nValencia regional President Carlos Mazón defended his administration’s management of the crisis, saying “all our supervisors followed the standard protocol.\"",

        "content": "FRANKTOWN, Colo. — In the early morning hours of Aug. 3, 1933, following two days of heavy rain, Castlewood Dam keeper Hugh E. Paine was awoken by a horrendous noise described by him as sounding like a tornado. Grabbing his kerosene lamp, Paine walked out to the dam to see what was causing the noise.\n\nWhat Paine saw that morning was the making of a disaster that, in a matter of hours, would take the lives of two people and ravage farms, ranches and parts of Denver—causing nearly $23 million (in today’s dollars) in damages in the midst of the Great Depression. But it may have been a lot worse if it weren't for the actions of the 48-year-old caretaker that morning.\n\nAug. 3, 2023, is the 90th anniversary of the collapse of the Castlewood Dam, which was constructed in 1890 near Castle Rock and held back the Cherry Creek. It's construction created a reservoir — called Lake Louisa by many — with a capacity of 5,300 acre-feet of water. It's a little-known piece of Colorado history that had lasting impacts on the region.\n\nToday, what's left of the dam — the right and left abutments and part of its crest — sits quietly like an ancient Roman ruin in front of a now-dry reservoir bed inside Castlewood Canyon State Park, 40 miles southeast of Denver. It became a state park in 1964 and expanded another 792 acres, to include the former dam and reservoir, in the 1970s.\n\nCherry Creek still meanders through the canyon, now unobstructed, carving an even deeper canyon through 90 years of erosion. Flood control is now handled by the Cherry Creek Dam, which was built in 1949 as part of a $275 million New Deal program.\n\nRon Claussen, a former park employee and volunteer, said Castlewood Dam may have been doomed from the beginning because of how and where it was constructed.\n\n\"All the rocks is Castle Rock conglomerate. It was quarried from the cliff faces on both sides. So, the material was handy. The problem is, when you look around here, this is Dawson Arkose, very crumbly, soft sandstone. So it was probably not the best place to put it,\" Claussen said.\n\n**Castlewood Dam was prone to leaking**\n\nBuilt in 1889, the 600 feet long, 70 feet tall Castlewood Dam provided irrigation water for surrounding farms and a new agriculture development in the town of Melvin, Colorado, which is now underwater in the Cherry Creek Reservoir.\n\n“They were selling 40-acre lots for apple trees at cetera. Well, they needed irrigation water because it's hot and dry around here in July and August. So, this thing was supposed to supply water down to those folks down there,” Claussen explained.\n\nWith a width at the base of about 50 feet, it took 11 months and 83 men to complete the dam which was started by the Denver Water Storage Company. A.M. Welles was the chief engineer and designer of the project. The reservoir it created was a recreational destination for many in the Denver area.\n\nBut almost immediately after its completion, the dam began having problems.\n\n“It leaked from the very beginning when they finished it 1890,” Claussen said. \"And in 1902, there was a big fix. And if we walk around to the other side, you'll see the whole other side of the dam is just filled in with dirt, because they just put tons and tons of dirt up against the dam.\"\n\nFears of the dam breaking and damaging homes and businesses downstream began spreading when news of the leaks made headlines in Denver. In an April 17, 1900, article in the Rocky Mountain News, Welles tried to dispel those fears. He told the paper that if the dam were to break, it wouldn’t have much of an impact on Denver.\n\n“Now, as a matter of fact, if the dam broke, and I don’t care how large a break it was, by the time the head of the flood had reached Denver the last drop would not be out of the dam. Not by any means. If the whole contents of the lake were allowed to spread out, allowing for the removal of the portions of the dam that would be carried away in front of the flood, the water would not do much more than fill the channel of the creek.” Wells is quoted as saying in the article.\n\nBut of course that wasn't the case. The 1933 flood as a result of the break was devastating blow to the city of Denver.\n\n**Disaster strikes at 1:30 a.m.**\n\nThe Castlewood Dam stood for 43 years up until 1:30 a.m. on Aug. 3, 1933. Two days of non-stop rain was too much for the dam to handle. Paine, the dam caretaker, knew it too. His attempts at opening several of the dam's valves to relieve the pressure, wasn't going to stop what was 43 years in the making.\n\nThe eastern section of the dam was the first to break, followed by the middle and western sections. The dam's foundation was weakened by years of erosion. The collapse released more than 1 billion gallons of water downstream and sent an eleven foot wall of water thundering down Cherry Creek. By 7 a.m., that wall of water arrived in Denver, taking out several bridges and flooding homes and businesses along the way.\n\n\"When you're driving down Speer Boulevard, you've got that beautiful little concrete channel with a bike path down there and a nice slowly running creek. The water was going up over the top. There was a log that floated into the lobby of Union Station and bumped into stuff,\" Claussen explained.\n\nNews accounts at the time painted a frightful picture. In an Aug. 3, 1933 article in the The World-Independent, the Associated Press reported on the casualties and the devastation: \"Mrs. Claude Hill, 50, mother of seven, was drowned near Mathieson near Colorado Springs and her body was found several miles down the gulch. Her home was swept from its foundation and carried several hundred yards by the torrent. Hill and the children escaped.\"\n\nA second victim — 81-year-old Tom Casey — was taken by the floodwaters. \"He stepped off his back porch into a hole, water, and he couldn't get out. He drowned,\" Claussen said.\n\nThe flood continued to ravage Denver, spreading to downtown shops and Union Station. The AP article continues: \"The flood carried tons of debris into Denver and isolated several sections. Police patrol automobiles sounded the alarm after the dam broke, and about two o’clock this morning the police rescued several marooned families. The water supply in many sections of the city was demoralized. Telephone and light service is impaired. Six inches of water covered the floor of the Union Station. Merchandise stores and scores of store basements were damaged. Prisoners were removed from the city to the county jail, and several feet of water covers the low level downtown streets.\"\n\nDenver remained flooded for several days. The break caused extensive property damage throughout the area, leaving a trail of destruction to highways, crops, livestock, railroads and buildings. It was estimated to have caused damage to 1,100 pieces of property.\n\nSevere weather continues to wreak havoc in some parts of the park. Heavy rainfall in June destroyed every bridge crossing over Cherry Creek. More than 14 inches of rain has fallen over Castlewood Canyon since Jan. 1, according to the National Weather Service. On June 22, the high level mark was 9.5 feet. Normal creek levels are typically between 2 to 3 feet. Crews are working at restoring the bridges but it will take weeks and may not be completed before August.\n\n**The heroes of this story**\n\nPaine and Nettie Driskill, a Parker telephone operator, were hailed as heroes for the actions they took that August morning in 1933. The warning Paine provided to Driskill who then conveyed it to those downstream is credited with saving several lives.\n\n\"He tried to get out and ride to Castle Rock, but the rod was washed out. So the dam took out the road. So he had to go up and he started calling people. Then there was Nettie Driskill, who lived up in Parker, she was a telephone operator. When she got wind of it, she started calling police departments, fire departments on downstream. So that's how everybody knew what was coming and why nobody else really got killed,\" Claussen explained.\n\nPaine was born in Douglas County and lived all his life in Castle Rock, according to a March 2, 1939, article in The Englewood Herald. He died on Feb. 28, 1939 at St. Joseph’s Hospital. The paper reported that Paine had \"long suffered from a stomach ailment. He went to the hospital February 18, and underwent an operation.\"\n\nDriskill received national acclaim and was even featured in Time magazine.\n\n**The Night the Dam Gave Way**\n\nIn the late 90s, park officials published a booklet — written and researched by Sharon Randall, Tracy Dixon and Patty Horan — that chronicled personal accounts of the 1933 flood. Many were young children or teenagers, but area citizens remember the night the Castlewood dam gave way.\n\nBelow are some examples from the publication titled, *The Night the Dam Gave Way, A Diary of Personal Accounts**:*\n\n**Gone fishing, a green horse & Lake Louisa**\n\nAs a lad of about five, I was given the privilege of going fishing when my chores were finished. I would set out with a willow pole I had fashioned with some grocer’s twine and a hook given to me by someone who had my welfare at interest.\n\nAbout a mile north of our ranch home was a wooden pier that extended from the roadside into the water of the lake. A true “Tom Sawyer,” I walked the mile with my freshly dug worms in a can and sat on the pier with my bare feet splashing in the cool water. This was my daydreaming place. I don’t recall what luck I had catching fish, but at the time that was not terribly important.\n\nI enjoyed many summer mornings at waters edge and was always reluctant to check the time. We didn’t have digital watches as children, but were taught to tell time by the position of the sun and the length of our shadows. Growing up we were always expected to appear at mealtime, or no lunch or dinner!\n\nWhen the dam washed out in the flood of 1933, my siblings and I were fast asleep. About daybreak we were awakened by my Uncle John, who was in charge of horses and had been out gathering and feeding them. He called to us in our bedrooms that we should get up to see the “green horse” in the lake. We tumbled out of bed and hastily got dressed and assembled to go see a green horse. We drove north on Castlewood Canyon Road to the reservoir and saw the broken wall of the dam and no water. Nothing remained but a shiny pit of silt in the naked bottom of the lake and not a green horse to be seen anywhere!\n\nOur family has a connection to the construction of the Castlewood dam and reservoir through my great Aunt Louisa Roracher Engel, wife of homesteader George Engel. I grew up listening to Aunt Louisa tell these stories.\n\nAs pioneer ranchers, my aunt and uncle sought every opportunity to exist and prosper in an era of limited opportunities. When the dam was being built, the company had numerous workmen and teams on the site. It was a natural challenge to my great aunt to provide services to them. The workmen lived in tents on the site. The labor was intense and there were few amenities. Aunt Louisa contracted with the company to feed the workers and provide hay and grain for the animals. She would hitch up her wagon and take a cold lunch at noon, mostly homemade bread, smoked sausage and often cheese, all products that they made at the ranch. In the evening, after a long day of toil in muddy conditions, the men could look forward to a hot meal of beef stew, chicken or pork. They had a homemade dessert on special days or weekends. My great aunt had a garden where she grew everything from asparagus to strawberries, so the menu was varied for those isolated workers in an austere environment.\n\nNeedless to say, there were many occupational injuries at the site and lucky for the men, my great aunt was also a trained nurse. She had a remedy for all ailments, but the one they liked most was a whiskey flask she carried in her apron to relieve pain.\n\nBesides being the first catering service in Douglas County,Aunt Louisa was also the medical practitioner. On her days off, she laundered and mended the workers’ clothes.Aunt Louisa related these stories to me with a sense of pride. She found satisfaction in doing what she could to help others, at the same time providing her an opportunity to benefit financially. Her stories were of a simpler time.When the workers had a day off, she prepared a special meal, enhanced with some chokecherry wine. The men sat around a campfire and a fiddler among the group provided music. The men would join in singing.And they would hold hands and dance circling the fire and keeping time to the music—what Aunt Louisa termed “a miner’s jig.”\n\nWhen the construction of the dam ended, the workers who had been fed and nursed showed their appreciation to the enterprising woman who had helped make a difficult project reality.They held a ceremony and christened the lake they were creating ‘Lake Louisa.’\n\n**Telephone Rang in the Night**\n\nIn 1933, I was a child living with my parents at what is now Leetsdale Drive and Forest Street.Very early in the morning on Aug. 4, while it was still dark, our telephone rang. It was the Sullivan telephone operator with the warning that everyone should go to high ground as the Castlewood dam had collapsed and there was a huge flood coming. My parents immediately got us dressed and we drove to the top of the hill near Forest and Alameda. By this time it was starting to get light and we were able to see the first signs of the flood coming down Cherry Creek. It was carrying debris of all types, as well as large, uprooted trees. The water overflowed the banks and many homes and dairies that were near the creek were flooded.\n\nSomewhat later in the morning, Mother went downtown to do some shopping. Soon she came hurrying back having been warned that another flood, even larger than the first one was coming down the creek. This must have been entirely a wild area. If it was a flood, people would have time to move their farm animals to higher ground. Our switch went as far as the Doepke Ranch, from there Josie Doepke notified Hugh Paine at Castlewood dam. Also, Castle Rock and on to Franktown. The word got out without television or video cameras.\n\nIf I recall correctly, we had been having frequent rains and small floods the summer of 1933.When the call came in the evening of Aug. 3, 1933, the report was:“This is a big one.”That time of day our animals were all secure.The alarm was passed on. Then, all we could do was watch and wait, hoping our telephone lines were not washed out.We also worried about our many friends along Cherry Creek in Franktown and Parker.\n\nWe did not hear that Castlewood dam had gone out until early the next morning when Josie Doepke called us.We passed the word along the phone line.\n\nWe heard about the flooding of Denver on our radio.We then began to worry about Dad’s brother, Ivan Gilbert, who had a tire store on the corner of 13th and Speer Boulevard.We finally heard from him that everything was all right and he had not suffered much damage.\n\nCounty bridges were washed out.Telephones were down.Those two items got top priority in our area. As soon as the water went down, repairs were begun.\n\nAfter the flood, we were unable to cross Cherry Creek for several days. We would go through our pasture and our neighbor’s to the south, to get to Greenland Road. We could also go west through the school section and reach Dahlberg Road. These back trails were well defined as they had been used by the early settlers to get from neighbor to neighbor by horse and buggy.\n\nThe loss of Castlewood dam was felt by everyone, just as much by the ones “above” the dam as the ones “below.” Friends and neighbors had lost property, crops and animals. In spite of the precautions, some people just did not get the word in time.\n\nWe all know the result of this flood and the loss of Castlewood dam was the construction of Cherry Creek dam. I am glad my father lived to see it started, even though he didn’t live to see it finished. My father was a strong advocate of soil conservation dams which would help prevent such serious flooding in the future.\n\nWhen we lost Castlewood dam, we also lost our favorite picnic area. It was one of the places we always took our out-of-state visitors to see. The park is a beautiful place, but it will never be the same to me.\n\n**A Young Man’s Adventures**\n\nIn the early 1930s, I was going to East High School in Denver. My closest friends and I were strongly attracted by the lore of the West. Our heroes were Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Kit Carson and the other legends of those exciting times. Naturally we were interested in the guns used by these men, and spent many Saturday mornings visiting the pawnshops and gun stores on Larimer Street where a Colt Frontier six-shooter could be bought for $10. All of us had been trained by our fathers in the use of firearms and it was easy to find safe places to shoot at tin cans by going a short distance beyond the edge of town, which was then at about 26th and Monaco.\n\nThis was also the time when Model T Fords had become obsolete and used ones were selling for $25. One of my friends had one, and when we could scrape together enough for a little gas at 15 cents a gallon, we extended our range. We discovered Castlewood Canyon and spent time exploring and walking across the dam. From the high rocks on the east side we could look across the lake, which seemed very large. One calm day we decided to see how far our shots would carry, by observing the splashes. I had a .45 as I recall, its heavy bullet carried about half-way across the lake.\n\nWhen the dam broke in 1933, I along with just about everybody awoke to the news on the radio of the catastrophe and hurried down to a vantage point to see the debris filled muddy waters choking the course of Cherry Creek and piled up against the bridges.\n\nThat fall, having graduated from East, I took a course in anthropology under Dr. E.B. Renaud at the University of Denver. I did not re-enter college until the fall of 1934, but in the meantime, with my friend, Hugh Capps, engaged in some amateur archeological exploration. We identified many sites on the Plains and collected arrowheads, fragments of pottery, bone implements and grinding stones. We also excavated a rock shelter in Red Rocks Park. About mid-summer, I remembered the large cave under the west rimrock of Castlewood Canyon. We persuaded my mother to drive us out there and leave us for three or four days. After carrying our gear up to the cave we made camp and began digging, turning up a patched moccasin as well as the usual potsherds and flint and bone tools, typical of the Plains Indian culture.\n\nIn the back of the cave there was a dripping seep from the roof which gave us a supply of drinkable water, which we caught in a pan. The cave seemed to extend some distance beyond this, and I got the idea that a mountain lion might be holed up there, so I crawled in as far as I could go with a flashlight in one hand and my trusty six-shooter in the other. Fortunately, no mountain lion was in residence.\n\nWe had heard stories that a group of robbers had holed up in the cave. At one time against the rimrock at the north end of the cave, we found the remains of a roughly built corral.\n\nThe work in the cave was hot and dusty, but we found a place in the gouged out bed of the creek where the flood waters had created a waterfall slightly more than head high. The remaining flow was enough to create a perfect shower where we washed and refreshed ourselves in the morning and also after the day’s work. Of course to enjoy this luxury we had to climb down the canyon wall and back up again. But it was worth it!\n\nWhile there, we also explored some of the canyons to the west of Castlewood, but did not discover another cave to match the one we were living in. We did find a good spring bubbling out of the ground near the entrance to one of the western canyons.\n\nIt is my recollection that, at the time I am writing about much of this area, it was embraced in one or more of the “school” sections, land reserved to the state for the support of the schools. A few years later I attended an auction of this land, or part of it. Unfortunately, the bidding quickly exceeded my means.",

Click here to find out more.\n\nPosts stating dams were intentionally removed or opened to intensify the floods in Spain spread on X, after the extreme rainfalls, which caused widespread destruction, and claimed more than 220 lives in eastern and southern Spain.\n\nClaims on Facebook and X also argued weather manipulation and geo-engineering played a role in the floods, often citing US-based High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) (archived here), which studies physical processes in the highest regions of the atmosphere -- and has been a long-time target of conspiracy theorists, who falsely claim it can manufacture extreme weather events.\n\nBut these claims are baseless -- often using inaccurate, out-of-context or inflated data and images to make false statements about the floods.\n\nAFP reviewed the most commonly-found claims in English, below.\n\n### Small, outdated reservoirs\n\nMultiple posts in November stated the floods were intentionally worsened by the opening or complete removal of dams across Spain, theories AFP debunked in Spanish and in French.\n\nTo support their argument, some posts cited data reported by European Union-funded project, \"Dam Removal Europe,\" AFP found through keyword searches on Google (archived here).\n\nThe project does exist, but it aims to remove river barriers that cause safety or environmental issues due to a lack of maintenance.\n\nIn its 2022 report (archived here), the project states \"Spain was the trailblazer of barrier removal in Europe\" with 133 reportedly-removed structures that year.\n\nThe barriers targeted, experts told AFP, are reservoirs of a size that could not have worsened the size of the floods in October and November.\n\nAtmospheric physics professor at the University of Barcelona, María del Carmen Llasat Botija (archived here), told AFP on November 20: \"It is completely false that dams are being removed in Spain. Dams in Spain are necessary for the management of water resources, the production of hydroelectric energy and flood control.\"\n\nWhile some posts illustrated their claims with images of the Forata dam surrounding the Magro river, overflowing, the dam in fact \"prevented the disaster from being greater,\" she remarked -- as reported by Spanish newspaper, El Mundo (archived here).\n\nCésar Rodríguez (archived here), secretary general for river conservation association AEMS-Ríos con Vida (archived here), also told AFP on November 4 that the capacity of the reservoirs was \"insignificant\" compared to the magnitude of the historic floods in Valencia.\n\nIn contrast, if left untouched, old and neglected reservoirs can pose public and environmental challenges, according to Escuder Bueno.\n\nMariana de Brito Helmholtz (archived here), a researcher on hydro-climatic extremes at the Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, Germany, agreed.\n\nShe told AFP on November 24 the \"weirs were dismantled as part of ecosystem restoration efforts,\" and in some cases, she added, precisely to reduce flood risks.\n\nShe concluded: \"Aging weirs can pose safety concerns if not maintained, such as the risk of breaching. Their removal is unlikely to have had any significant impact on the severity of the recent floods.\"\n\n### Misused atlas\n\nPeople online also said a map, widely shared on social media, purports to show dams removed around flood-hit regions of Spain.\n\n\"The blue dots all indicate dams that have been removed around Valencia. This is something the mainstream media should be telling you. But they won't,\" an October 31 post said on X.\n\nThis claim, too, is false.\n\nA reverse image search on Google revealed the map stems from the AMBER river barrier atlas (archived here), a data project by the European Union, which tracks barriers along European rivers in an effort to restore river ecosystems.\n\nUsing the AMBER tool and zooming in on Valencia, AFP found a map visually matching the one shared on social media, with blue dots corresponding to existing weirs, not removed dams.\n\nThe atlas marks all artificial instream barriers in Europe with different colors, which can be selected and unselected. Green dots point to dams in the region.\n\n### Unrelated vessel activity\n\n\"HAARP anyone? This was off of the coast of Spain before their floods,\" claims a November 7 post on Facebook -- AFP debunked similar claims in Spanish and Greek.\n\nA keyword search for \"Karadeniz Powership Orhan Khan\" -- the lettering seen on the ship in the video posted on social media -- however yielded results for a Turkish merchant ship on tracking website, Marine Traffic, whose last recorded position is in the Gulf of Izmit, in the Sea of Marmara.\n\nShipnext, another vessel tracker, reports (archived here) the location of the vessel between coastal Turkish towns of Yalova and Darica from late October to late November, as seen in the screenshot below.\n\nThe merchant ship -- which sails under the Liberian flag -- belongs to Turkish fleet company KarPowership (archived here), and is displayed on its website.\n\n###\nImage\nA screenshot of a vessel taken on Turkish fleet company website KarPowership on November 26, 2024\n\n### Climate impacts\n\nElla Gilbert, a meteorologist at the British Antarctic Survey (archived here), previously told AFP that \"heatwaves, droughts, storms and floods are all caused by a variety of different conditions in the atmosphere and are often the result of the random combination of weather events.\"\n\nShe said it \"makes no sense\" to raise the idea that any technology -- including HAARP, whose site is located in Alaska and operates a few times a year -- is bringing about such extreme events.\n\nWhile Mediterranean storms are common for the time of year, scientists say climate change driven by human activity is also increasing the intensity, length and frequency of extreme weather events.\n\nThe exact influence of anthropogenic warming on the recent events in Spain will require extensive scientific research but a preliminary analysis (archived here) by the World Weather Attribution indicates the deluge was made 12 percent heavier and twice as likely compared to the world before global warming.\n\nDaniel Jato-Espino, flood risk assessment senior researcher at the International University of Valencia (archived here), agreed, citing \"unusually high temperature of the Mediterranean Sea at this time of the year, which is linked to anthropogenic climate change\" as one of the drivers of the intense floods.\n\nIn turn, \"this increase in temperature leads to increased water vapor formation, which rises and condenses due to the region's orography, resulting in heavy rainfall,\" he explained to AFP on November 26.\n\nCallum Hood, head of research at the Center for Countering Digital Hate (archived here), remarked that as severe weather events become more frequent, \"climate deniers are putting extra efforts into claiming these extremes have nothing to do with climate change.\"\n\nOnline, \"a slightly more conspiratorial and newer argument\" overtakes the traditional narratives that simply deny Earth's warming \"by trying to argue that extreme weather events have this other cause, whether it's geoengineering or something else,\" he told AFP in a previous story.\n\nAFP has debunked other claims about extreme weather events, here, here and here.\n\nIs there content that you would like AFP to fact-check?

        "content": "At least 95 people have been killed by severe flash floods in Spain, according to authorities on Wednesday, as emergency responders scramble to find dozens of missing people.\n\nIn the worst-affected region of Valencia, 92 people were killed, according to Angel Victor Torres, Spain’s minister of territorial policy and democratic memory. Two others died in Castile-La-Mancha, and one person in Andalusia.\n\nSeveral locations in southern and eastern Spain were hit with up to 12 inches of rain in just a few hours on Tuesday, in what marked the worst rainfall in** **Valencia in 28 years, according to state weather agency AEMET.\n\nEmergency services in Valencia, the city of Malaga, and Castile-La-Mancha, among other regions, said they were still working on finding dozens of missing people.\n\nEmiliano García-Page, president of Castile-La-Mancha’s regional government, compared the deluge to a levee breaking. “It’s not a rain pour, it was like a dam burst,” García-Page told Spain’s national broadcaster TVE. “People were calling [emergency numbers] crying, asking for help and it was almost impossible to reach them.”\n\nThe badly hit Valencia region was thrown into a state of chaos, with most highways becoming completely unusable on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. Vehicles that had been left abandoned in traffic were picked up by the water and moved around.\n\nA courthouse was turned into a temporary morgue in the regional capital, also called Valencia, said local authorities, as the death toll is feared to climb.\n\nAt least 40 people, six of whom were in a retirement home, died in the town of Paiporta in Valencia, Spanish state news agency EFE reported, citing its mayor.\n\nVideos posted by several rescue agencies on Wednesday show entire streets flooded, people stuck on rooftops and cars piled up and flipped over.\n\nAround 1,200 people are thought to still be trapped in different parts of a highway in Valencia, and 5,000 vehicles are blocked as a result of the surging flood waters, EFE reported, citing Spain’s Guardia Civil.\n\nTrains have been suspended in the Valencia region, as have other major public services in other affected regions. Schools, museums, and public libraries in the Valencia region will be closed on Thursday, according to the local government.\n\nIn Malaga, in the Andalusia region, a 71-year-old British man died from hypothermia, according to the city’s mayor, Francisco de la Torre.\n\n## ‘We don’t know where our parents are’\n\nSurvivors and family members of the missing spoke to TVE about the terrifying downpour. “It was agonizing. When we saw the water rising and reaching the first floor of the house we went to the roof,” one resident told TVE. “We stayed on the roof until 4 a.m. [11 p.m. ET Tuesday]. We didn’t have water, we were cold. Finally, the helicopter arrived.”\n\n“Everything is destroyed, but at least we are here to tell [the story],” she added.\n\nPetruta Sandu’s family was also caught off-guard by the sudden flooding. She last spoke to her parents late on Tuesday night when they had been trapped on the roof of their car as waters rose around them.\n\n“Since the 10 p.m. last night, we don’t know anything about our parents,” she told TVE. “My brother-in-law walked almost 7 km [over 4 miles] through knee-deep water to find the helicopter and find the vehicle but they didn’t find anyone. We don’t know where our parents are.”\n\nIn towns close to rivers such as Utiel or Paiporta, water spilled onto the streets, CNN en Español reported. Vans, cars and garbage cans were swept away by currents that, in some cases, reached the first floor of buildings.\n\nAEMET reports that the “cold drop” that caused the flooding is the worst Valencia has experienced this century. The term “cold drop” refers to a pool of cooler air high in the atmosphere, which can separate from the jet stream, causing it to move slowly and often lead to high-impact rainfall events. The phenomenon is most common in autumn.\n\nThe sheer amount of rain that fell meant many were taken by surprise, with people finding themselves trapped in their basements or first floors and unable to get to safety.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday that his government would use all means necessary to help victims of the floods, as he asked people to remain vigilant. He is set to visit Valencia on Thursday.\n\nDefense Minister Margarita Robles described the flooding as an “unprecedented phenomenon,” CNN en Español reported. Robles said that more than 1,000 members of the military had been deployed to assist in rescue efforts.\n\nThe Spanish government has decreed three days of official mourning for victims of the flooding, starting on Thursday.\n\nA local resident from one of the affected towns, Antonio Carmona, described to CNN what happened when the floods hit. “When we looked by here, we saw everything going down. (The water) took cars, it took down half of the house of one of our neighbors.”\n\nCarmona pointed to his torn clothing, saying he and others had been saving dogs caught up in the flooding.\n\nOne woman named Beatriz Garrote was driving home from work in the city of Torrent in Valencia on Tuesday evening when she found herself trapped on a stretch of the ring road by the rising water for several hours alongside other drivers, according to Spanish newspaper El Pais.\n\n“I went past the first exit, which was for Paiporta, but it was closed because they told us that the town was flooded there and we couldn’t exit,” she said, El Pais reported. She said her car then got stuck “and suddenly the two lanes closest to the exit started flooding.”\n\nShe described feeling “very scared” as water levels rose rapidly. “I didn’t know where it was coming from or what was happening. The water started to rise very quickly.\n\n“After 10 minutes, it was halfway up the car’s wheel. One of the volunteers told us to turn the cars around but there was no possible exit.”\n\nThe human-caused climate crisis is making extreme weather more frequent and more severe, scientists say.\n\nAs the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution, the most intense rain events are getting heavier and more frequent. Hotter oceans fuel stronger storms and a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, which it wrings out in the form of torrential rainfall.\n\nRainfall warnings continue through Wednesday for portions of eastern and southern Spain, according to AEMET, with the threat of heavy rain expected to continue through the end of the week.\n\n*This story has been updated with the latest developments. *\n\nCNN’s Antoinette Radford, Vasco Cotovio, Laura Paddison, Brandon Miller and Mia Alberti contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Though the Guadalupe River basin high in the Texas Hill Country is known for its flooding danger, the lack of a modern flood warning system sent campers and others in low-lying areas scrambling with little sounding of alarms.\n\nLocal emergency officials and the National Weather Service get their information from four gauges along the Guadalupe River upstream from Kerrville, where the flash flooding that killed at least 68 people occurred on July 4.\n\nOne of four gauges on the river failed, likely because of the wall of water that surged downstream in the early hours of Friday. In places, water rose 40-feet above the streambed. As crews raced to respond to low areas along the river, and campers and others fled, a review of the sensor data shows the river grew in height, width and speed with sudden force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n**TEXAS FLOODING UPDATES:** The latest news and analysis from the Hill Country floods\n\nNo design, dam or flood control project is going to solve the threat posed by the uppermost part of the river basin.\n\n### Want more Houston Chronicle?\n\n“You cannot engineer yourself around the Guadalupe,” said Phil Bedient, the director of Rice University's SSPEED Center, who has spent decades designing flood protection and prediction systems. “This one is crying out for a warning system.”\n\nState and local officials rely on those gauges to monitor the Guadalupe, along with a more antiquated system that warns drivers of high water at low parts of state roads and tracks rainfall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAlong Texas 39 and FM 1340, the Texas Department of Transportation has sensors that monitor when the roads are topped by floodwaters. All told, fewer than 35 sensors along roads or the riverbank can activate flashing lights or tell emergency officials where water is encroaching and the river is flooding.\n\nKerr County Judge Robert Kelly on Friday called the Guadalupe “the most dangerous river valley in the United States,” as rescuers scoured low-lying areas for victims.\n\n“He is probably right about that,” Bedient said.\n\nThe reason is three-fold, Bedient said: Intense storms, steep slopes and rapid movement of those storms into the low-lying areas in the Hill Country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n“When you are dealing with that, all bets are off,” he said. “It is a raging torrent, and it has nothing to do with water getting into the ground.”\n\n**WIDESPREAD DAMAGE:** Photos show devastation at Camp Mystic, across the Hill Country\n\nThat is precisely what gauges along the Guadalupe indicate happened on Friday. As the rain strengthened and stalled over Kerr County, the north fork of the Guadalupe west of Hunt surged. The river went from two feet at 2 a.m. to nearly seven feet in an hour. The gauge topped out at 19.5 feet around 5 a.m.\n\n“These things invariably occur in the middle of the night,” Bedient said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe water level grew progressively higher as it flowed downstream. The next monitor, along the main river at Hunt, rose 20 feet in roughly 95 minutes, topping at 37.5 feet just after 5:00 a.m.\n\nThe river might have risen even more, but the monitor stopped providing updates at 5:10 a.m., before coming back online around 3:45 p.m. on Saturday.\n\nSensors downstream peaked around 7 a.m., and by 11 a.m. levels at all the upper Guadalupe sensors were dropping back to more common levels during rains.\n\n“It just rips,” Bedient said of the fast rise and fall. “And because it rips… there should be an effort to do a better gauging job up on the Guadalupe.”\n\nThat is especially true near the origin of the river in Kerr County, he said, where the speed of the flooding is predictable, but gives officials scant time to spread the word. Moments can make the difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n“Get to high ground,\" Bedient said. “These are steep watersheds but you can get to high ground. You just have to get 25 feet higher.”\n\n## Damage throughout the basin\n\nDeath and injury from flooding is a constant along the Guadalupe, with seven of the nine counties having at least one fatality from a flash flood, river flood or heavy rain in the past 30 years. Since Jan. 1, 1996, 50 people have died and 4,439 have been injured in flooding events in the counties through which the river basin runs. Hays County, the most populous, leads the way with 15 deaths, 13 of which happened during heavy flooding in Wimberley on Memorial Day weekend in 2015.\n\nThroughout the river basin, the majority of fatalities come along roadways when people travel into high water, officials said.\n\nThough the topography and risk remains high for devastating flooding, Kerr County has avoided casualties in recent years. Between 1996 and June 2025, the county reported three deaths and 22 injuries during 98 flooding events and heavy rains.\n\nIn 1987, during what is now the second-worst flooding along the river, 10 campers were killed when the last bus leaving an inundated campground near Comfort was unable to cross a low point near the riverbank.\n\nLed by counselors, 43 adults and children tried to form a human chain and make it to higher ground, but many were soon swept away. A frantic rescue ensued, with helicopter pilots inching lower into the trees to pluck youngsters from the branches. One teenager died, falling from an attempted helicopter rescue.\n\nAs with Friday, Comfort was complicated because the campers were in low-lying areas around the river.\n\n“They are down by the river because that is where they can swim and camp,” Bedient said of the popular recreation areas, many on private land with their own access roads.\n\n## Early work on early warning\n\nThe Comfort tragedy led to the installation of the current monitoring stations, while other incidents in the basin have led to even more planning – but so far no major changes in Kerr County.\n\nFollowing the deadly 2015 flooding on the Blanco River in Wimberley, officials in the Guadalupe Valley explored the need for more sensors that could create an early warning system.\n\n“We literally have minutes or hours before something is going to happen based on a rain event,” Kerr County Engineer Charlie Hastings said during a Feb. 3, 2021, discussion of a new system.\n\n**'LAST ACT OF KINDNESS': **Camp Mystic owner died trying to save campers, family members say\n\nThe system would be like those used for years in Harris and Bexar counties, which combines weather data, gauges along waterways and emergency management warnings. Put together, the forecasts and real-time information give officials a way to alert people as the risk of rising waters increases.\n\nThe systems, which Bedient has helped develop, have saved lives and property in specific locations, such as the Texas Medical Center. Investment in them, however, has not been prioritized in less populated areas, including Kerr County.\n\nKerr County’s preliminary plan for a warning system, at a cost of between $750,000 and $1 million, was completed by mid-2017. During that 2021 discussion, then-county commissioner Jonathan Letz said the efforts to find state funding later that year and in 2018 ran into competition with another storm – Hurricane Harvey.\n\n“All the money went to that one event, which made sense,” he said.\n\nThe plan, now part of a $9.5 million system along the 230-mile river to the Gulf of Mexico, is ranked 23rd in terms of priority in the state’s 2024 flood plan.\n\nBedient said it is likely, as Comfort led to investment, so will Friday’s flooding.\n\n“I would be very surprised if there is not a major effort,” he said.",

        "content": "# Rescuers frantically search for survivors after at least 64 people killed in catastrophic Spain flooding\n\nAt least 64 people have died in eastern Spain after flash floods swept away cars, turned village streets into rivers and disrupted rail lines and highways in the worst natural disaster to hit the European nation in recent memory.\n\nEmergency services in the eastern region of Valencia confirmed a death toll of 62 people on Wednesday. Another two casualties were reported in the neighboring Castilla La Mancha region.\n\nRainstorms on Tuesday caused flooding in a wide swath of southern and eastern Spain, stretching from Malaga to Valencia. Mud-colored floods sent vehicles tumbling down streets at high speeds, while pieces of wood swirled in the water mixed with household items. Police and rescue services used helicopters to lift people from their homes and rubber boats to reach drivers trapped on the roofs of cars.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said dozens of towns had been flooded and warned that the danger is not over.\n\n“For those who are looking for their loved ones, all of Spain feels your pain,” Sánchez said in a televised address. “Our priority is to help you. We are putting all the resources necessary so that we can recover from this tragedy.”\n\nAuthorities reported several missing people late Tuesday, but the following morning brought the shocking announcement of dozens found dead.\n\n“Yesterday was the worst day of my life,” Ricardo Gabaldón, the mayor of Utiel, a town in Valencia, told national broadcaster RTVE. He said several people were still missing in his town.\n\n“We were trapped like rats. Cars and trash containers were flowing down the streets. The water was rising to 3 meters (9.8 feet),” he said.\n\nOver 1,000 soldiers from Spain’s emergency response units were deployed to the devastated areas. Rescue services were also rushing eastwards from other parts of Spain. Spain’s central government set up a crisis committee to help coordinate rescue efforts.\n\nOne elderly couple were rescued from the upper story of their house by a military unit using a bulldozer, with three soldiers accompanying them in the huge shovel.\n\nTelevision reports showed videos shot by panicked residents documenting waters flooding the ground floors of apartment buildings, streams bursting their banks and bridges giving way.\n\nSpain’s national weather service called the rainfall “extraordinary,” with 491 litres per square meter (108 gallons per 32.3 square feet) accumulated in eight hours in the Valencian locality of Chiva.\n\nSpain has experienced similar autumn storms in recent years. Nothing, however, compared to the devastation over the last two days, which recalls floods in Germany and Belgium in 2021 in which 230 people were killed.\n\nThe death toll will likely rise with other regions yet to report victims and search efforts continuing in areas with difficult access.\n\nIn the village of Letur in the neighboring Castilla La Mancha region, Mayor Sergio Marín Sánchez said six people were missing.\n\nSpain is still recovering from a severe drought and continues to register record high temperatures in recent years. Scientists say increased episodes of extreme weather are likely linked to climate change.\n\nThe prolonged drought has also made it more difficult for the land to absorb high volumes of water.\n\nThe storms unleashed a freak hailstorm which punched holes in car windows and greenhouses as well as a rarely seen tornado.\n\nTransport was also impacted. A high-speed train with nearly 300 people on board derailed near Malaga, although rail authorities said no one was hurt. High-speed train service between Valencia city and Madrid was interrupted, as were commuter lines.\n\nValencian regional President Carlos Mazón urged people to stay at home, with travel by road already difficult due to fallen trees and wrecked vehicles. Rescue efforts were hampered, Mazón, said, by downed power lines that left areas without electricity, while phone lines were jammed with calls. He said that the regional emergency service had attended some 30,000 calls.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels that the EU will assist by using its Copernicus geo-monitoring satellite system “to help coordinate the rescue teams.”\n\nThe European Union leader said that the bloc stands ready to activate a civil protection mechanism offering the combined assistance of the other 26 member countries should Spain request assistance.\n\n“Europe is ready to help,” Von der Leyen said.\n\nAs the waters fell, thick layers of mud mixed with refuse made streets unrecognizable.\n\n“The neighborhood is destroyed, all the cars are on top of each other, it’s literally smashed up,” Christian Viena, a bar owner in the Valencian village of Barrio de la Torre, said by phone. “Everything is a total wreck, everything is ready to be thrown away. The mud is almost 30 centimeters (11 inches) deep.”\n\nOutside Viena’s bar, people were venturing out to see what they could salvage. Cars were piled up and the streets were filled with clumps of water-logged branches.\n\nRelatives of the missing filled social media and local television and radio outlets with appeals to find their loved ones.\n\n### Start your day with all you need to know\n\nMorning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.\n\n### Thanks for signing up!\n\nLeonardo Enrique told RTVE that his family had been searching for hours for his son, Leonardo Enrique Rivera, 40, who was driving a delivery van when it began to rain.\n\nHis son had sent a message saying his van was flooding and that he had been hit by another vehicle when he was near Ribarroja, an industrial town which is one of the worst affected, Enrique said.\n\nLocated south of Barcelona down the Mediterranean coast, Valencia is a tourist destination known for its beaches, citrus orchards, and as the home of Spain’s paella rice dish.\n\nLike some other areas of Spain, Valencia has gorges and small riverbeds that spend much of the year completely dry but quickly fill with water when it rains. Many of them pass through populated areas.\n\nThe rain had subsided in Valencia by late Wednesday morning as the storm headed north, prompting authorities in the Barcelona region to issue weather alerts.]",

        "content": "# Spain floods death toll hits 205 as maps, satellite images reveal Valencia impact and residents blast response\n\n*Chiva, Spain* — The death toll from historic flash floods in Spain climbed to at least 205 people Friday, with many more believed to be missing, as the initial shock gave way to anger, frustration and a wave of solidarity. Spanish emergency authorities said 202 of the victims were in the Valencia region alone, and officials warned that more rains were expected in the coming days.\n\nThe damage from the storm Tuesday and Wednesday recalled the aftermath of a tsunami, with survivors left to pick up the pieces as they mourn loved ones lost in Spain's deadliest natural disaster in living memory.\n\nMany streets were still blocked by piled-up vehicles and debris, in some cases trapping residents in their homes.\n\nSome places still don't have electricity, running water, or stable telephone connections.\n\n## \"It's a disaster and there is very little help\"\n\n\"The situation is unbelievable. It's a disaster and there is very little help,\" said Emilio Cuartero, a resident of Masanasa, on the outskirts of Valencia. \"We need machinery, cranes, so that the sites can be accessed. We need a lot of help, and bread and water.\"\n\nIn Chiva, residents were busy Friday clearing debris from mud-filled streets. The Valencian town received more rain in eight hours on Tuesday than it had in the preceding 20 months, and water overflowed a gully that crosses the town, tearing up roads and the walls of houses.\n\nThe mayor, Amparo Fort, told RNE radio that \"entire houses have disappeared, we don't know if there were people inside or not.\"\n\nSo far 205 bodies have been recovered - 202 in Valencia, two in the Castilla La Mancha region and one more in Andalusia. Members of the security forces and soldiers are busy searching for an unknown number of missing people, many feared to still be trapped in wrecked vehicles or flooded garages.\n\n\"I have been there all my life, all my memories are there, my parents lived there ... and now in one night it is all gone,\" Chiva resident Juan Vicente Pérez told The Associated Press near the place he lost his home. \"If we had waited five more minutes, we would not be here in this world.\"\n\n## Maps show scale of Spain floods, where more rain is forecast\n\nBefore-and-after satellite images of the city of Valencia illustrated the scale of the catastrophe, showing the transformation of the Mediterranean metropolis into a landscape inundated with muddy waters. The V-33 highway was completely covered in the brown of a thick layer of mud.\n\nMaps created using data published by Spain's National Meteorological Agency, meanwhile, show the sheer quantity of rainfall in the hardest-hit areas.\n\nSome areas just west of Valencia city, including Chiva, got more than 325 millimeters, or more than a foot of rain, on Oct. 29 alone. A significant swathe of the Valencia region got between five and 7 inches on the same day.\n\nAs authorities have repeated over and over, more storms were still expected. The Spanish weather agency issued alerts Friday for strong rains in Tarragona, Catalonia, as well as part of the Balearic Islands and in western Andalusia in the southwest of the country.\n\n## Residents blast lack of help and lack of advance warning\n\nThe tragedy has unleashed a wave of local solidarity. Residents in communities such as Paiporta - where at least 62 people died - and Catarroja have been walking miles in sticky mud to Valencia to get supplies, passing neighbors from unaffected areas who are bringing water, essential products and shovels or brooms to help remove the mud. The number of people coming to help is so high that the authorities have asked them not to drive there because they block the roads needed by the emergency services.\n\nIn addition to the contributions of volunteers, associations such as the Red Cross and town councils are distributing food.\n\nMeanwhile, flood survivors and volunteers are engaged in the titanic task of clearing an omnipresent layer of dense mud. The storm cut power and water services on Tuesday night but about 85% of 155.000 affected customers had their power back on by Friday, the utility said in a statement.\n\n\"This is a disaster. There are a lot of elderly people who don't have medicine. There are children who don't have food. We don't have milk, we don't have water. We have no access to anything,\" a resident of Alfafar, one of the most affected towns in south Valencia, told state television station TVE. \"No one even came to warn us on the first day.\"\n\nJuan Ramón Adsuara, the mayor of Alfafar, said the aid isn't nearly enough for residents trapped in an \"extreme situation.\"\n\n\"There are people living with corpses at home. It's very sad. We are organizing ourselves, but we are running out of everything,\" he told reporters. \"We go with vans to Valencia, we buy and we come back, but here we are totally forgotten.\"\n\nRushing water turned narrow streets into death traps and spawned rivers that tore through homes and businesses, leaving many uninhabitable.\n\nSome shops have been looted and the authorities have arrested 50 people.\n\nSocial networks have channeled the needs of those affected. Some posted images of missing people in the hope of getting information about their whereabouts, while others launched initiatives such as Suport Mutu — or Mutual Support — which connects requests for help with people who are offering it. Others organized collections of basic goods throughout the country or launched fundraisers.\n\n## The role of climate change in Spain's flood disaster\n\nSpain's Mediterranean coast is used to autumn storms that can cause flooding, but this was the most powerful flash flooding in recent memory. Scientists link it to climate change, which is also behind increasingly high temperatures and droughts in Spain and the heating up of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nHuman-caused climate change has doubled the likelihood of a storm like this week's deluge in Valencia, according to a partial analysis issued Thursday by World Weather Attribution, a group made up of dozens of international scientists who study global warming's role in extreme weather.\n\nSpain has suffered through an almost two-year drought, making the flooding worse because the dry ground was so hard that it could not absorb the rain.\n\nIn August 1996, a flood swept away a campsite along the Gallego river in Biescas, in the northeast, killing 87 people.",

Rebuilding the damaged areas will take untold weeks or months, and for now, emergency crews are grappling with inaccessible areas that have been cut off by the damage.\n\nResidents have described \"nightmare\" scenes, with one Valencia resident telling our reporter that all locals now \"know someone who has died\".\n\nPrime Minister Pedro Sánchez warned residents in affected areas to \"stay home\", echoing an earlier statement from King Felipe VI who said the emergency is \"not over\".\n\nMore rain is expected to fall on Friday, posing risk of new flooding, since the ground is already saturated with water.\n\nWe'll be ending our live coverage shortly, but you can read more on this story across our website:",

        "content": "# 5 things to watch as Syria confronts a new future\n\nThe Islamist rebels whose swift seizure of Syria over the weekend toppled long-time dictator Bashar al-Assad have not only ushered in an unsettled new era for the troubled country, but they promise to reshuffle the region's fraught geopolitics.\n\nThe ousting of Assad, who ruled Syria for a quarter century after assuming power from his father, leaves a dangerous political vacuum. Ahmed al-Shara – formerly known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohmmad al-Jolani – at the head of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, is at least nominally in charge. He and his group are at the helm of a fractious rebel alliance that fought Assad over more than 13 years of civil war.** **Formerly known as the al-Nusra Front, HTS was once affiliated with al-Qaida. Although Shara claims to have broken ties with al-Qaida, HTS remains on a __U.S. State Department list__ of terrorist organizations.\n\nIt's a complex and fluid situation on the ground, and most observers agree it's all but impossible to predict how things will play out in the coming days, weeks and months. But as Syria marks the start of a new chapter, here are five dynamics that experts say will be important to pay attention to.\n\n### How smooth will the political transition be?\n\nWhile Assad and other regime figures fled Syria in the hours before the rebels seized power in Damascus, Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi Jalali stood his post. \"We are working so that the transitional period is quick and smooth,\" Jalali told Sky News Arabia TV on Monday, according to __The Associated Press__.\n\nHaving Assad's prime minister stay on was \"clearly an arrangement\" with the rebels, says Joshua Landis, a Syria specialist at the University of Oklahoma. \"They've worked it out, what seems to be a temporary, peaceful handover of power.\"\n\nIn a __meeting on Monday with Jalali__, the HTS leader acknowledged that despite the rebel victory, \"we can't dispense with the previous state.\"\n\nSanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the London-based think tank Chatham House, says it is too early to signal any outcome. \"I think we have to give everybody a bit of time to figure it out,\" she says.\n\nVakil says Syria could learn a lesson from the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq that toppled Sadaam Hussein in 2003. In the wake of Hussein's fall, the U.S. dissolved the ruling Baath Party, leading to a breakdown in basic services that helped set the stage for the mass chaos that ultimately swept the country. Vakil says that \"including technocrats and perhaps holdovers from the Assad government is a way of building consensus and broader support.\"\n\n### Years of bad blood and fears of an Islamist regime will make reconciliation a challenge\n\nThe diversity of ethnic and religious stakeholders in Syria paints a complicated picture: Assad's powerbase was drawn from Shia Muslims, and the small but influential Alawite religious minority that he belongs to, combined with other groups make up about 13% of the population. Sunni Muslims, by contrast, account for roughly three-quarters of Syria.\n\nThe Alawite minority, concentrated mainly on the Mediterranean coast, has now suddenly found itself out of power and potentially more vulnerable. Landis says there's \"considerable tension\" between the two main Muslim groups in Syria. But so far, there are no signs of reprisals by the new leaders, he says. Everyone is trying to figure out \"whether there's going to be revenge killings or real disturbances in the Alawite territories,\" Landis says.\n\nStill, there are signs of some fraying. In the northeast of the country, Kurdish forces have been driven out of Manbij by Arab-led opposition forces.\n\nVakil says there's concern that Syria could descend into a strict fundamentalist Islamic state similar to Taliban-led Afghanistan, although the country's new leaders have made pronouncements that seek to dispel that fear.\n\nThe rebels, for instance, issued a __statement on social media__ Monday instructing their fighters that it is \"strictly forbidden to interfere with women's dress or impose any request related to their clothing or appearance, including requests for modesty.\"\n\nBut U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen, speaking in Qatar, on Sunday, sounded a word of caution, saying he was hearing \"contradictory messages\" coming from the new leadership. \"This is now my key message to all – avoid bloodshed, make sure that it is inclusive, that all communities in Syria are included, and that the nervousness that some are facing, are fearing, that we can address this, and move forward to peace and stability,\" he said.\n\n### There are millions of Syrian refugees waiting to return home\n\nRefugees who fled during the civil war are already trying to return. Many were lining up at border crossings in Turkey on Monday, __according to the AP.__\n\n\"Syria is at a crossroads – between peace and war, stability and lawlessness, reconstruction or further ruin,\" the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in a statement on Monday The agency said that \"recent developments bring hope that the suffering of the Syrian people may finally end, and that the world's largest forced displacement crisis can move towards just solutions.\"\n\nBut ultimately, experts say, the pace or returns will be shaped by how much political stability Syria's next leaders can deliver.\n\n\"Many of them are going to want to go home,\" says Landis, adding that he thinks that given the history of their predicament, he thinks that \"most will take a wait and see\" position.\n\nDaniel Mouton, a Middle East expert at the Atlantic Council, __writes__ that* *\"Millions of Syrian refugees will want to return home and are more likely to do so in an environment of good governance and active reconstruction.\"\n\n### The risks of a power vacuum are very real\n\nGovernments across the region are all too familiar with the dangers that can come after an autocrat's fall. Civil war dominated Libya for years after the death of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, just as it did in Iraq after Hussein was toppled. Today, they're watching events in Syria with a wary eye.\n\nOn the surface, the ouster of Assad might look like a net positive for Israel. Both Iran and Hezbollah, the Tehran-backed militia that Israel has sought to destroy in neighboring Lebanon, were among the former Syrian dictator's key backers.\n\nHours after rebels took the Syrian capital, however, Israel moved into a demilitarized buffer zone with Syria that had been maintained without violation since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights — an area seized from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War and later annexed by Israel — proclaiming that the move into the buffer zone was a \"temporary defensive position.\"\n\nIsrael has also __launched hundreds of airstrikes__ against Syria in recent days, saying it has taken out 70% of the Syrian army's capabilities — a move criticized Tuesday by Pedersen, the U.N. special envoy. \"We are continuing to see Israeli movements and bombardments into Syrian territory. This needs to stop,\" he said.\n\nVakil says the collapse of the Assad regime places Israel in a difficult position. \"As a democracy, I think it is obliged to try and support [the transition] process [in Syria] and try and actually stay out of this process,\" she says.\n\nFor Jordan, Vakil says, Assad's ouster could be a positive, \"if there is eventually parliamentary democracy and more inclusive parliamentary democracy\" in Syria. \"And if, on the other hand, you do see a sort of Taliban-like scenario emerge, that's not going to be particularly positive for a country like Jordan that has its own Muslim Brotherhood.\"\n\n### The U.S., Russia and Iran also have interests in Syria\n\nSince the start of anti-Assad uprisings in 2011, the U.S. government has imposed a __series of sanctions__ aimed at stopping violence against civilians.\n\nEven so, President Biden, in a __televised address on Sunday__, expressed concern about the post-Assad government in Syria: \"Make no mistake, some of the rebel groups who took down Assad have their own grim record of terrorism and human rights abuses,\" Biden said. \"We've taken note of the statements by the leaders of these rebel groups in recent days and they're saying the right things now. But as they take on more responsibility, we will assess not just their words, but their actions.\"\n\nVakil says the administration wants \"to curb the potential comeback of ISIS and other terrorist groups.\"\n\nU.S. warplanes struck \"dozens\" of \"ISIS leaders, operatives and camps\" on Sunday, according to __U.S. Central Command__. On Monday, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh __said__: \"Centcom, together with allies and partners in the region, will continue to carry out operations to degrade ISIS capabilities, even during this dynamic period in Syria.\"\n\nIt's unclear, however, how long those efforts will last. President-elect Donald Trump as recently as this past weekend __said__ the U.S. should stay out of the fighting in Syria, and during his first term flirted with removing all U.S. forces from the country.\n\nAbout 900 U.S. troops are stationed in Syria, mostly in oil-rich areas controlled by Kurdish militia forces. Syria's economy is highly dependent on oil revenues and the presence of U.S. troops has denied the Assad regime access to those fields.\n\n\"Over the next six months, the United States is going to be in re-evaluation mode,\" Landis says. \"If it wants good relations with this new state, it can't punish it forever by withholding the oil.\"\n\nRussia — a staunch ally of Assad and the destination for his immediate exile after fleeing Syria over the weekend — appears to have little recourse but to accept the new reality in the country.\n\nMoscow, in particular, is concerned about losing key military installations that its sees as a counterweight to NATO in the region — a naval base at Tartus on the Mediterranean coast and the Hmeimim air base in Syria's Latakia province. __Reuters__ reports that Syria's new leaders have agreed to guarantee the safety of Russian military bases.\n\nFor Iran, losing Assad as an ally has further eroded its influence — especially after Israel's war against its regional proxies Hamas and Hezbollah. Hezbollah helped keep Assad in power, and the militant group has for years used Syria as a conduit to transfer weapons into Lebanon.\n\nSpeaking in Doha, Qatar, on Saturday, as Syrian rebels were closing in on Damascus, U.S. Envoy __Amos Hochstein said__ Iran's withdrawal from Syria would \"make it very difficult … to transfer weapons in.\"\n\n\"I definitely wouldn't write Russia out. And I will also say the same thing about Iran,\" Vakil says. \"I think both countries will be looking to maybe not immediately, but over time and rekindle whatever ties they have for different purposes.\"",

        "content": "At the historic Umayyad Mosque in the heart of Damascus, a red, white, black and green flag flies.\n\nOn the other side of the Syrian capital, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s palace burns.\n\nAn anchor reads the Sunday news: “We announce to you from the Syrian news channel the victory of the great Syrian revolution after 13 years of patience and sacrifice.”\n\nAnd on the streets, hundreds of people cheer, celebrating the stunning fall of 50 years of the Assad family’s dictatorship.\n\nAfter less than two weeks of fighting across Syria’s northwest, rebel groups swiftly seized control of the capital. Their presence seemed to catch the regime off guard, forcing Assad to flee to Russia with his family.\n\n“We are now the happiest country in the world,” one man told CNN on the road leading to Damascus on Sunday.\n\nIn a speech from the Umayyad Mosque on Sunday, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the leader of Syria’s main rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), called the toppling of Assad a “victory for the entire Islamic nation.”\n\n“This is a nation that, if its rights are taken, will continue to demand them until they are restored,” Jolani said, adding that HTS was liberating people who were imprisoned by the Assad regime.\n\nTheir swift move into the capital astonished citizens and the rest of the world.\n\nHere’s how the rebels’ ascent to power unfolded:\n\n## November 27: Rebel forces launch their first attack\n\nSyrian rebel forces launched a large-scale attack on Assad’s forces in western Aleppo, the first sign of what was to come from their offensive and marking the first flare-up between the two sides in years.\n\nAt least 37 people were killed – both regime forces and allied militia – and rebels seized 13 villages, including the strategic towns of Urm al-Sughra and Anjara, as well as Base 46, the largest Syrian regime army base in western Aleppo, according to a statement by opposition factions at the time.\n\nIt was unclear then if the attacks meant anything more. Rebel groups said they were in response to recent artillery shelling from Assad’s regime.\n\nBut it quickly became clear that wasn’t the case. Three days later, the first city would fall.\n\n## November 30: Rebels take control of Aleppo city\n\nOn November 30, the rebel groups conducted a lightning-fast offensive, killing dozens of government soldiers and taking control of Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city.\n\nIt was the first time they had set foot there since government forces regained control in 2016. By early morning, they had seized large parts of the city, footage geolocated by CNN revealed.\n\nThe Syrian army tacitly acknowledged its forces were in retreat, saying “large numbers of terrorists” had forced it to “implement a redeployment operation.” It said reinforcements were on their way and government forces were preparing for a “counteroffensive.”\n\n## December 5: Rebels take control of Hama\n\nThe rebels continued their offensive onward to the city of Hama.\n\nHama is strategically located at a key crossroads in western-central Syria, providing direct supply lines between Damascus and Aleppo.\n\nThe Assad regime had held Hama for more than a decade, but by Thursday the Syrian military said it had to withdraw after rebels “penetrated several parts of the city.”\n\nVideos geolocated by CNN showed rebel fighters celebrating – almost in disbelief at their progress – as they entered Hama.\n\n“Guys, my country is being liberated. I swear to God, we are inside Hama city, we are inside Aleppo city,” a fighter cheered as he filmed himself by a local landmark in Hama.\n\nFrom there, the rebels had their eyes set on Homs.\n\n## December 6: Rebels take control of Daraa, the birthplace of the 2011 uprising\n\nThe opposition forces continued their push onwards toward Damascus, seizing the city of Daraa with the assistance of rebel factions who represented the Druze sect in the neighboring city of as-Suwayda.\n\nThe army said it was “redeploying” after the attack, with rebels attacking the forces from both the north and the south.\n\nIn the southern city of Homs, hundreds of people appeared to flee on Friday night as rebel forces said they reached the city wall.\n\n## December 7: Homs falls\n\nAfter moving south for days, the HTS quickly took control of Homs.\n\nOn Saturday evening, the HTS said it had “fully liberated” the major city, as Syrians tore down posters of Assad and set fire to them.\n\n“We were able to liberate four Syrian cities within 24 hours: Daraa, Quneitra, Suwayda and Homs,” said Lt. Col. Hassan Abdul Ghani, a spokesperson for the main rebel group, ahead of their entry to Damascus.\n\nAfter the regime forces left, residents flooded the streets in celebration.\n\n## December 8: Damascus – and Assad’s rule – falls to rebels\n\nEarly on Sunday morning, Syrian rebels declared the capital of Damascus “liberated” after entering the city with very little resistance from regime forces.\n\nCelebratory gunfire could be heard as word spread of Assad fleeing the capital. Footage shared on social media and verified by CNN showed similar scenes in Aleppo, which fell to the rebels just over a week earlier.\n\nRussian state media soon confirmed that Assad had fled to Moscow, and Jolani addressed Syrians from the Umayyad Mosque. He said: “This victory, my brothers, is a victory for the entire Islamic nation. This new triumph, my brothers, marks a new chapter in the history of the region.”\n\n*CNN’s Eyad Kourdi, Mostafa Salem and Mohammad Tawfeeq contributed to this report.*",

        "content": "Monica Fernández knows only too well the pain of exile.\n\nIn 1958, in the years after the Spanish civil war when the country was in ruins, her father left in search of a better life in Argentina but always wanted to return to Spain.\n\nIt was not to be.\n\nInstead, Manuel Fernández Lago died in his adopted home in 1987.\n\nNow, his daughter, a lawyer, is embarking on an emotional journey as she represents hundreds of people from across Latin America who wish to move to Spain.\n\nThey hope to take advantage of Spain's new so-called Democratic Memory Law which took effect in October. It gives the descendants of exiles from the 1939-1975 dictatorship of General Francisco Franco the right to claim Spanish citizenship.\n\nHistorians estimate about 2 million people left Spain between the start of the civil war in 1936 and the first democratic constitution in 1978, with many heading to Latin America or other parts of Europe.\n\n\"This is a real personal thing for me. My family was from Asturias in northern Spain. My grandmother died singing the hymn of Asturias,\" Fernández told VOA by telephone from Buenos Aires.\n\nLawyers and consulates across South America reported that they have received thousands of applications. Law firms and exiles' organizations estimate that about 400,000 people may be eligible to apply.\n\nThe law was intended to atone for the wrongs of the past but could also help Spain deal with a big threat to its future: its aging population. Spain has the second lowest birth rate in Europe with each woman giving birth to an average of 1.19 children, according to 2020 data from Eurostat, the European Commission statistics office. The lowest figure was for Malta at 1.13 while the highest was 1.83 in France.\n\nThe legislation has been dubbed the \"ley de nietos\" – the grandchild law – because it is based on family links rather than where an applicant was born.\n\nIt also covers the descendants of women who lost their Spanish citizenship by default when they married non-Spanish men. Applicants must show proof of parentage or proof of political persecution.\n\nThere is a broad definition of what constitutes persecution. It can refer to physical, moral or psychological damage, economic damage or the loss of fundamental rights.\n\nLila Andrea González, an English teacher from Buenos Aires, is tracing her family back to Lugo in northern Spain where her grandmother Florentina López lived before leaving in the 1930s. The grandmother moved to Uruguay and later settled in Argentina.\n\nGonzález is claiming citizenship on behalf of her late grandmother. Part of the law allows for applications from the descendants of women who lost their citizenship because they married foreign nationals.\n\n\"This is not just about Franco and persecution but about reparation for women who lost all their rights when they married,\" González told VOA from Patagonia in southern Argentina.\n\n\"It is important that we recognize the rights of women. They did not have any of these rights until the first democratic constitution in 1978.\"\n\n**Demographic crisis **\n\nMigrants offer some hope to solve Spain's demographic conundrum.\n\nSpain's birth rate has been falling for the past century and last year 338,532 babies were born, a 39% drop compared to a decade ago, according to the Spanish National Institute (INE), a statistics agency.\n\nThe population is set to rise from the current figure of 47 million to 51 million by 2037, according to a projection by INE last month. New arrivals from abroad will boost numbers, not people born in Spain, experts believe.\n\nAlejandro Macarrón Larumbe of Demographic Renaissance, a foundation which studies population issues, told VOA that more migrants would help but not solve Spain's underlying problem of a decreasing birth rate.\n\n\"Already it is easier for many Latin Americans to get Spanish citizenship than many other countries like the United States or Britain. They only have to be in Spain for a shorter time than other nations who, like Britons, must be in Spain for 10 years,\" he noted.\n\n\"But expecting other people to come over to Spain to have babies will not solve the underlying problem of an older population where the number of babies born to Spanish-born people is less and less.\"",

But rebels struck at a moment of weakness for those countries.\n\nThe government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, which had kept rebel forces at bay for more than a decade with Iranian and Russian military support, collapsed with astonishing speed on Sunday morning after an advance by opposition forces on the capital, Damascus.\n\nAn authoritarian leader who had gassed his own people during a 13-year civil war, Mr. al-Assad fled the country as rebel forces closed in on Damascus.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Russian state media outlets and two Iranian officials said he had arrived in Russia, where state media outlets reported that Mr. al-Assad and his family had been granted political asylum. The New York Times could not immediately independently confirm that Mr. al-Assad was in Russia, which along with Iran had helped keep him in power.\n\nThe rebel offensive had lasted less than two weeks.\n\n## Where rebels swept across Syria over two weeks\n\nHere’s how the main rebel coalition advanced through the northwest.\n\nAs of Nov. 26 (before offensive)\n\nTurkish-backed\n\nopposition\n\nJoint control\n\nwith Syrian\n\ngov’t\n\nTURKEY\n\nAleppo\n\nKurds\n\nKurds\n\nMain rebel\n\ncoalition\n\nHama\n\nSyrian government\n\nHoms\n\nArea of\n\ndetail\n\nSYRIA\n\nDamascus\n\n40 miles\n\nLebanon\n\nDec. 3\n\nTurkish-backed\n\nopposition\n\nTURKEY\n\nAleppo\n\nKurds\n\nMain rebel\n\ncoalition\n\nHama\n\nSyrian government\n\nHoms\n\nDamascus\n\n40 miles\n\nLebanon\n\n25 MILES\n\nDec. 5\n\nTurkish-backed\n\nopposition\n\nTURKEY\n\nAleppo\n\nKurds\n\nMain rebel\n\ncoalition\n\nHama\n\nSyrian government\n\nHoms\n\nDamascus\n\n40 miles\n\nLebanon\n\nDec. 7\n\nTurkish-backed\n\nopposition\n\nTURKEY\n\nAleppo\n\nKurdish advances\n\nafter government\n\nwithdrawal\n\nMain rebel\n\ncoalition\n\nHama\n\nSyrian government\n\nHoms\n\nDamascus\n\n40 miles\n\nLebanon\n\nAs of Nov. 26 (before offensive)\n\nDec. 3\n\nTurkish-backed\n\nopposition\n\nTurkish-backed\n\nopposition\n\nJoint control\n\nwith Syrian\n\ngov’t\n\nTURKEY\n\nTURKEY\n\nAleppo\n\nAleppo\n\nKurds\n\nKurds\n\nMain rebel\n\ncoalition\n\nMain rebel\n\ncoalition\n\nHama\n\nHama\n\nSyrian government\n\nSyrian government\n\nHoms\n\nHoms\n\nArea of\n\ndetail\n\nSYRIA\n\nDamascus\n\n40 miles\n\nDamascus\n\n40 miles\n\nLebanon\n\nLebanon\n\n25 MILES\n\nDec. 5\n\nDec. 7\n\nTurkish-backed\n\nopposition\n\nTurkish-backed\n\nopposition\n\nTURKEY\n\nTURKEY\n\nAleppo\n\nAleppo\n\nKurds\n\nKurdish advances after\n\ngoverment withdrawal\n\nMain rebel\n\ncoalition\n\nMain rebel\n\ncoalition\n\nHama\n\nHama\n\nSyrian government\n\nSyrian government\n\nHoms\n\nHoms\n\nDamascus\n\n40 miles\n\nDamascus\n\n40 miles\n\nLebanon\n\nLebanon\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Mr. al-Assad had “decided to leave the presidential post and depart the country” after talks with other “parties to the conflict.” He had given instructions to transfer power peacefully, the ministry said.\n\nThere was no comment from Mr. al-Assad. His prime minister, Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali, stayed behind and said he was ready to cooperate with the rebels. The opposition forces swept into Damascus with little apparent resistance from the Syrian military, seizing control of government buildings and the state broadcaster.\n\nFor years, the Syrian civil war — which had erupted in tandem with the anti-government Arab Spring uprisings in 2011 and continued with horrific violence until 2017 — remained unresolved, but relatively stagnant.\n\nThen, in October 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, and the subsequent war upended the regional chess board of the Middle East. The Syrian rebels struck at a moment of weakness for Mr. al-Assad’s main allies: Iran, Russia and Hezbollah, the militant group based in Lebanon and backed by Iran.\n\nIran’s power has been curtailed by its conflict with Israel. Hezbollah, Iran’s main proxy force in the region, whose fighters had also played a key role in propping up Mr. al-Assad, has been battered by the war with Israel as well, with its top leaders killed. In Europe, the invasion of Ukraine has sapped Russia’s military of men, munitions and other resources.\n\nWaiting in the wings was Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group once linked to Al Qaeda. It later joined a coalition with more moderate partners but is still classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and others. The group maintained its authoritarian rule over Idlib Province in the northwest for half a decade, taxing residents to run its operations but following Islamic precepts to respect minority groups.\n\nAbout a year ago, it began preparing for a sweeping offensive south toward Damascus. The coalition, which analysts say received covert support from Turkey, established a military training academy in the north, churning out disciplined, highly motivated officers and soldiers, the analysts said.\n\n“The revolution has transitioned from chaos and randomness to a state of order,” Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the commander of the rebel units, said last week in a television interview.\n\nMr. al-Jolani’s coalition launched its lightning offensive on Nov. 27, first taking Syria’s largest city, Aleppo. The rebels went on to seize the city of Hama, which had never fallen during the civil war, and then Homs, a strategic city about 100 miles from the capital.\n\nAnother group of insurgents from south of Damascus were actually the first to enter the capital. At times the rebels seemed as surprised by their success as the rest of the world.\n\nOn the other side, Syrian government forces had done little to rejuvenate themselves. “They had low morale, no training, no weapons, no chain of command and a lot of corruption,” said Ibrahim Hamidi, the Syrian editor in chief of Al Majalla, an online current events magazine based in London.\n\nSyrian government forces, without troops from Hezbollah and Iran to back them and with relatively little support from Russian airstrikes, collapsed in disarray. Even the Fourth Armored Division and the Republican Guards, the elite forces stationed around Damascus to in theory make it coup-proof, seemed to evaporate.\n\n“We have seen the hollowing out of the Syrian state,” said Mona Yacoubian, head of the Middle East and North Africa Center at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington.\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had built his strategy of making Moscow a player again in the Middle East around his support for Mr. al-Assad, even as the Kremlin grew weary of his refusal to engage with Turkey, not to mention the opposition, to settle the conflict. “It is a humiliation for Putin,” Mr. Hamidi said.\n\nAmid the many conflicts of the Middle East, the United States had long had an ambivalent relationship toward the situation in Syria, wary of pushing for a regime change that would bring what Obama administration officials used to call the “catastrophic success” of a jihadist government in Damascus.\n\nThere are about 900 American soldiers in Syria, deployed in the northeast to back up a Kurdish militia there that had fought against the Islamic State militant group. Donald Trump had moved to withdraw them during his previous presidency, describing the country as “death and sand.” Now as president-elect, he has repeated that the United States should not get involved in Syria now.\n\nIt is not clear what kind of government will emerge in Syria, given the disparate coalition that brought down Mr. al-Assad, whose father first took over in a coup in 1970.\n\nWhatever the outcome, said Robert S. Ford, the American ambassador to Syria from 2011 to 2014, it is imperative for Washington “to decide once and for all what is their primary objective in Syria.”\n\nOther governments with stakes in the outcome in Syria will no doubt also be recalibrating, as will groups like the Islamic State, which once established a Caliphate in eastern Syria and has been resurgent in that desert region in recent months.\n\nFor now, Syrians who opposed Mr. al-Assad were ecstatic. In what were long rebel-held areas, people delighted in finally being able to look at the sky without fear of bombs raining down on them. And residents of Damascus who lived through years of his oppressive rule, expressed relief, but remained wary.\n\nWalaa Salameh, a mother of two young children, said she felt she was experiencing freedom for the first time in her life. But she added that she knows uncertainty lies ahead as the policies of a new government become clear.\n\n“Hopefully what is coming is better,” she said.\n\nAlan Yuhas contributed reporting.\n\nNeil MacFarquhar has been a Times reporter since 1995, writing about a range of topics from war to politics to the arts, both internationally and in the United States.\n\n## Related Content\n\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "# Syrian President Bashar al-Assad flees, war monitor says, as his government collapses and insurgents enter Damascus\n\nSyria's government appears to have fallen after opposition fighters said they had entered Damascus following a stunning advance, and a Syrian opposition war monitor reported that President Bashar al-Assad had left the country.\n\nSyrian opposition fighters said early Sunday local time that they had entered Damascus and residents of the capital reported the sounds of gunfire and explosions.\n\nRami Abdurrahman — who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor — told the Associated Press that Assad took a flight Sunday out of Damascus. Two senior Syrian army officers also told Reuters that Assad flew out of Damascus Sunday for an unknown destination. The White House indicated to CBS News it was unaware of Assad's whereabouts.\n\n\"President Biden and his team are closely monitoring the extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with regional partners,\" White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett wrote on social media.\n\nThe Syrian army notified officers that Assad's rule had ended, Reuters reported.\n\nSyrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said early Sunday that the government was ready to \"extend its hand\" to the opposition and hand over its functions to a transitional government.\n\n\"I am in my house and I have not left, and this is because of my belonging to this country,\" Jalili said in a video statement. He said he would go to his office to continue work in the morning and called on Syrian citizens not to deface public property.\n\nHe did not address reports that Assad had fled.\n\nThe pro-government Sham FM radio reported that Damascus airport was evacuated and all flights halted.\n\nThe insurgents also announced they had entered the notorious Saydnaya military prison north of the capital and \"liberated our prisoners\" there.\n\nDamascus was expected to fall, three U.S. officials had previously told CBS News, after Syrian insurgents surrounded the capital in a swiftly moving offensive that first began Nov. 27. Syrian insurgents also claimed early Sunday to have captured the key central city of Homs.\n\nIranian forces who'd been defending Assad had \"pretty much\" evacuated from Syria, the U.S. officials said earlier Saturday.\n\nSyrian insurgents reached Damascus on Saturday as part of a rapidly moving offensive that has seen them take over some of Syria's largest cities. It was the first time opposition forces had reached Damascus since 2018, when Syrian troops recaptured areas on the outskirts of the capital following a yearslong siege.\n\nThe advances in the past week were among the largest in recent years by opposition factions, led by a group that has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the United Nations. In their push to overthrow Assad's government, the insurgents have met little resistance from the Syrian army.\n\nThe fighters are led by the most powerful insurgent group in Syria, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, along with an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. Both have been entrenched in the northwest.\n\nAbdurrahman had earlier reported that insurgents were active in the Damascus suburbs of Maadamiyah, Jaramana and Daraya. He added that opposition fighters on Saturday were also marching from eastern Syria toward the Damascus suburb of Harasta.\n\nA commander with the insurgents, Hassan Abdul-Ghani, posted on the Telegram messaging app that opposition forces have started carrying out the \"final stage\" of their offensive by encircling Damascus. He added that insurgents were headed from southern Syria toward Damascus.\n\nGhani said early Sunday local time that insurgent forces had \"fully liberated\" Homs, Syria's third-largest city, Reuters reported, as government forces had supposedly abandoned the city. If they have indeed captured Homs, they would cut the link between Damascus, Assad's seat of power, and the northern coastal region where the president enjoys wide support.\n\nHis chief international backer, Russia, is busy with its war in Ukraine, and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of fighters to shore up his forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Iran, meanwhile, has seen its proxies across the region degraded by Israeli regular airstrikes. The Israel Defense Forces said on Saturday that after armed individuals carried out an attack at a U.N. post in the Hader area, their troops were currently assisting U.N. forces in repelling the attack.\n\nOn Saturday, President-elect Donald Trump commented on the situation on Truth Social, saying, \"THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!\"\n\nThree U.S. officials told CBS News that the Assad family's reign that started in 1971 appears to be ending.\n\n\"The United States is not going to...militarily dive into the middle of a Syrian civil war,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told an audience at the Reagan National Defense Forum, an annual gathering of national security officials, defense firms and lawmakers at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. \"What we are going to do is focus on the American national security priorities and interests.\"\n\nHe said the U.S. would keep acting as necessary to keep the Islamic State — a violently anti-Western extremist group not known to be involved in the offensive but with sleeper cells in Syria's deserts — from exploiting openings presented by the fighting.\n\n## How the conflict reignited\n\nThousands of people were fleeing from the area amid the dramatic escalation in the civil war, which had simmered without major advances by either side for years until the rebels mounted a shock offensive about two weeks ago.\n\nThe capture of Homs was a major victory for the rebels, who have already seized the northern cities of Aleppo and Hama, as well as large parts of the south, in a lightning offensive. Analysts said rebel control of Homs would be a game-changer. Aleppo is Syria's second-largest city.\n\nHTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday from Syria that the aim of the offensive is to overthrow Assad's government.\n\nThe Syrian army withdrew from much of southern Syria on Saturday, leaving more areas of the country, including two provincial capitals, under the control of opposition fighters, the military and an opposition war monitor said. The redeployment away from the southern provinces of Daraa and Sweida came as Syria's military sent large numbers of reinforcements to defend Homs.\n\nThe Syrian army said in a statement earlier Saturday that it had carried out redeployment and repositioning in Sweida and Daraa after its checkpoints came under attack by \"terrorists.\" The army said it is setting up a \"strong and coherent defensive and security belt in the area,\" apparently to defend Damascus from the south.\n\nSince Syria's conflict broke out in March 2011, the Syrian government has been referring to opposition gunmen as terrorists.\n\nIn the gas-rich nation of Qatar, the foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Turkey were scheduled to meet to discuss the situation in Syria. Turkey is a main backer of the rebels seeking to overthrow Assad.\n\nQatar's top diplomat, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, criticized Assad for failing to take advantage of the lull in fighting in recent years to address the country's underlying problems. \"Assad didn't seize this opportunity to start engaging and restoring his relationship with his people,\" he said.\n\nSheikh Mohammed said he was surprised by how quickly the rebels have advanced and said there is a real threat to Syria's \"territorial integrity.\" He said the war could \"damage and destroy what is left if there is no sense of urgency\" to start a political process.\n\nAfter the fall of the cities of Daraa and Sweida early Saturday, Syrian government forces remain in control of five provincial capitals — Damascus, Homs and Quneitra, as well as Latakia and Tartus on the Mediterranean coast.\n\nTartus is home to the only Russian naval base outside the former Soviet Union while Latakia is home to a major Russian air base.\n\nOn Friday, U.S.-backed fighters of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) captured wide parts of the eastern province of Deir el-Zour that borders Iraq as well as the provincial capital that carries the same name. The capture of areas in Deir el-Zour is a blow to Iran's influence in the region as the area is the gateway to the corridor linking the Mediterranean to Iran, a supply line for Iran-backed fighters, including Lebanon's Hezbollah.\n\nWith the capture of a main border crossing with Iraq by the SDF and after opposition fighters took control of the Naseeb border crossing to Jordan in southern Syria, the Syrian government's only gateway to the outside world is the Masnaa border crossing with Lebanon.",

        "content": "# Sudan’s exile media - fragile sources of news about a forgotten war\n\n**At least ten Sudanese exile media outlets have been founded or have continued to operate since Sudan’s civil war began two years ago, on 15 April 2023, and more than 400 journalists have fled to neighbouring countries, especially Egypt. While the international media continue to pay little attention to the humanitarian crisis resulting from the war, the exile media provide vital coverage, especially of abuses against civilians. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemns the harassment of Sudanese journalists in host countries.**\n\n*“RSF hails the courage and remarkable work of Sudan’s exile journalists. But we must not forget the price they pay for continuing to do their job to report the news. After surviving violence and destruction, most now endure very precarious conditions in their host countries, subjected to administrative uncertainties and sometimes harassment. RSF, which has already helped more than 50 Sudanese exile journalists by means of grants, urges host countries to let them regularise their situation and, instead of sending them back to Sudan, to offer them the stability that is essential for them to keep working. RSF also calls on the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to strengthen protection measures to prevent such expulsions and to prioritise journalists in resettlement programmes. Finally, RSF urges donors to provide more support to exile media, which are essential sources of freely-reported and independent information.*\n\nBefore the war, when **Hawa Daoud** was a reporter for the *Darfur 24* news website in El-Fasher, North Darfur’s capital, her salary enabled her to finance her sister's higher education. But this 28-year-old journalist has had no income since relocating to Kampala, Uganda, in June 2024. Daoud fled the fighting with her family after her neighbours were killed and her home was left without water. She told RSF that her journey of more than 2,000 km began with her work tools – her smartphone and laptop – being stolen by the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces.\n\nHer chilling account is by no means unusual in Sudan. The civil war that broke out between the regular army and Rapid Support Forces in April 2023 has killed tens of thousands of civilians and forced more than 12 million to flee within the country or to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. Far from sparing journalists, the warring parties have __killed at least seven media professionals and imprisoned at least 17 others__ in connection with their work in the past two years, according to RSF’s monitoring.\n\nRSF has also established that, as a result of this extreme violence, at least 431 journalists have fled to neighbouring countries: 300 to Egypt, 71 to Uganda, 23 to Kenya, 22 to Libya and 15 to Chad. This newly formed diaspora of journalists has created or recreated at least ten media outlets in exile, mainly news websites.\n\n**Vast network of Sudanese exile media**\n\nThe Egyptian capital, Cairo, which hosts the biggest Sudanese exile community, is where exile journalists run the *Sudania 24 *and *Sudan Bukra *TV channels and the *Al-Sudani*, *Saqia Press*, *Al-Ghad Al-Sudani* and *Ufuq Jdeed* online newspapers. Most of these media lack an actual office. The *Salam Media Network*, *Darfur 24* and *Al-Taghyeer* online media publish from Kampala, the Ugandan capital. The *Aïn* investigative website and the *Atar* news website cover Sudan from the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. *Beam Reports* is based in Kigali, Rwanda.\n\nThese media outlets have joined a bigger and older network of Sudanese exile news websites that continue to cover Sudan. *Mashaweer Platform*, founded in April 2022, operates from Paris, as does the *Sudan Tribune*, an online newspaper founded in 2003. *Radio Dabanga*, a news site specialising in Darfur, began broadcasting and publishing from the Netherlands in 2008.\n\n**Staff spread across several capitals**\n\nThe staff of the independent newspaper *Al-Jarida* have taken more than one route into exile. They are now spread across four countries – Uganda, Egypt, Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia. In this new working environment, WhatsApp groups have replaced a meeting room for the editorial conferences that punctuate journalists’ daily routines.\n\nThe new reality of a team split over several exile locations is shared by **Chawki Abd al Adhim**, the founder and editor of the investigative website *Istiqsaai*. He fled to Egypt, but some of his staff found refuge in Chad and others in South Sudan. “My correspondents in Sudan have also lost their jobs and their homes, and are worried about their safety,” he told RSF. Adhim, who also had his electronic equipment stolen, simultaneously works for the Saudi media outlet *Al Majalla*, because he only has a tourist visa and cannot therefore work for Egyptian media.\n\n**Sudanese army continues persecuting in Egypt with help from local security services**\n\nWhile Egypt is now home to the largest number of Sudanese exile journalists and media, it is also the country where working as a journalist is the most dangerous. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and his security and intelligence services are leading allies of the Sudanese military, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.\n\nIn May 2023, *Sudania 24* TV was forced to stop broadcasting from Cairo. The reason was its decision to invite a political figure from the civilian coalition opposed to the war. Although the channel subsequently resumed broadcasting, the political debate show “Derayat al-Hadath” was terminated for good in December 2024. “Intimidation, ranging from deportation to death threats and defamation campaigns, targeted the *Sudania 24* team, especially the show’s presenter, who was pressured to publish a statement in support of the Sudanese army,” a *Sudania 24* journalist told RSF on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn September 2023, the Egyptian security services raided the offices of the independent TV channel *Sudan Bukra*, detaining its staff and a guest, who were eventually released without charge. Two months later, its staff were told they were to be deported to Sudan.",

        "content": "# Santiago Carrillo\n\n**Santiago Carrillo** (born January 18, 1915, Gijón, Spain—died September 18, 2012, Madrid) was the secretary-general of the Communist Party of Spain from 1960 to 1982. He received wide publicity from his book *Eurocomunismo y estado* (1977; *Eurocommunism and the State*), which espoused the freedom and independence of national communist parties.\n\nCarrillo was born in Asturias, and his father was Wenceslao Carrillo, a leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party. His political involvement began through his membership in the Socialist Youth (Spanish: Juventadas Socialistas). Frustrated by the Socialists’ reformism and after visiting Moscow, Carrillo joined the Spanish Communist Party in November 1936. He was in charge of public order in Madrid, and some held him responsible for the massacre of prisoners at Paracuellos de Jarama and Torrejón de Ardoz in November of that year. After the Spanish Civil War he went to the Americas, and he later spent many years in Paris. He participated in the founding, in July 1974, of the Junta Democrática Española, which partially united the opposition to the regime of Francisco Franco, and in March 1977 he helped found the Coordinación Democrática, which incorporated the opposition parties and Spain’s regional autonomy movements.\n\n- In full:\n- Santiago Carrillo Solares\n\n- Died:\n- September 18, 2012, Madrid (aged 97)\n\n- Political Affiliation:\n- Communist Party of Spain\n\nAfter its legalization in 1977, the Spanish Communist Party maintained a low profile while winning votes and parliamentary seats.

He favoured working for “a plurality of political parties and for democratic alternation between the majority and the minority,” and he supported the Basque and Catalan sections of the Communist Party in their desire to take an independent stance based on the needs of their own regions. Because of discord within the party regarding his leadership, Carrillo resigned as secretary-general of the Spanish Communist Party in 1982 and later founded his own party, which had little electoral success.",

        "content": "# The 12-Day Revolution: How Syria’s Regime Collapsed After Years of War\n\nOpposition forces exploited internal decay and shifting alliances to dismantle Assad’s regime\n\nOpposition groups in Syria seized the capital Damascus on Sunday after nearly 13 years of conflict, declaring an end to President Bashar Assad’s government. The swift offensive—initiated on November 27 by a coalition led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), along with various Turkish-backed factions, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Southern Operations Room, and other armed groups—quickly overwhelmed pro-government forces.\n\nWithin 12 days, fighters gained control over the country’s major cities, culminating in the fall of the capital. By the time Damascus was taken, it appeared that the Assad government, which had held power since 1971, had collapsed. Officials loyal to Assad fled, Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali offered to work with the new authorities, and freed prisoners stumbled into the streets. Syria’s political and territorial landscape had drastically realigned.\n\n“This operation broke the enemy,” said Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the HTS leader, in an interview with The New York Times, referring to the coalition’s lightning advance and the decisive blow that spelled the end of Assad’s half-century family rule. The rapid progress came after months of quiet preparation. For years, large-scale operations had paused due to cease-fires and foreign negotiations. But as the Syrian government, entangled in corruption and dependent on alliances with Russia and Iran, weakened under domestic discontent and international strain, the opposition sensed a strategic opening.\n\nThe chain of events leading to the December 8 breakthrough began in northwestern Syria. From there, fighters pushed south toward Aleppo, swept through Idlib and Hama, secured Homs, and moved into Damascus. As pro-government units crumbled, allied Iranian militias withdrew, and Russian forces offered only limited support from the air, failing to halt the offensive. The rebels claimed the sudden collapse was a sign that after more than a decade of war, Syrians had lost patience with a government that many viewed as oppressive. Syrian forces had struggled with corruption, a narrowing support base, and an overextended military. This environment, combined with changing regional dynamics and the exhaustion of foreign allies, allowed the offensive to move forward at extraordinary speed.\n\n**A Brief Background to a Long War**\n\nThe Syrian conflict began in 2011 as part of the wave of uprisings known as the Arab Spring. Initially a popular protest movement demanding reforms and democratic elections, it faced a harsh government crackdown. By late 2011 and into 2012, what began as peaceful demonstrations evolved into an armed rebellion. Various factions emerged—some nationalist, some Islamist, some Kurdish-led—fragmenting Syria. Over time, external actors shaped the battlefield. Iran provided financial and military support to Assad, Hezbollah lent fighters, and Russia’s intervention in 2015 turned the tide in favor of the government. Turkey supported certain opposition groups, seeking to limit the expansion of Kurdish-led forces near its border. The United States focused on combating the Islamic State group, partnering with the SDF but never fully committing to removing Assad.\n\nThe civil war saw some of the most brutal acts of government repression in modern history, resulting in over 600,000 deaths—about half of them civilians—along with 7 million refugees and an equal number internally displaced. Among these were the siege and bombardment of Aleppo in late 2016, which killed more than 31,000 people; the shelling of opposition-held neighborhoods in Hama and Homs from 2011 to 2012, leaving over 10,000 dead; and a bombing campaign in Idlib from 2019 to 2021, claiming at least 1,600 lives. The 2013 sarin gas attack on Damascus suburbs, which killed 1,400 people, including many children, and the August 2012 Darayya massacre, where over 500 civilians were killed in shelling and mass executions, stand out as particularly infamous incidents. These atrocities, along with countless smaller-scale attacks, left deep scars on Syrian society as it faced the regime’s ruthless methods to maintain power.\n\nAfter years of fighting, a partial cease-fire in March 2020 slowed the frontlines in the northwest. Assad’s government held most populated areas, while rebels were mostly cornered in Idlib. The SDF controlled areas in the northeast. Turkey’s military presence stabilized certain zones. With this balance in place, some observers believed that the war had effectively become frozen, with no faction strong enough to achieve total victory.\n\nYet pressure built behind the scenes. HTS, previously linked to al-Qaida but now operating as a more localized Syrian Islamist force, reorganized. It formed a conventional army, trained specialized units, and set up night-raid teams. Quiet infiltration operations and sniper attacks against government positions resumed in late 2022. Meanwhile, corruption gnawed at government structures. Syria’s economy relied heavily on the drug trade—specifically the production and smuggling of Captagon. Critics described the Assad state as fractured and dependent on illicit profits. This criminalized economy disillusioned many within the government’s ranks and eroded its legitimacy.\n\nBy late 2024, foreign allies that once propped up Assad were distracted. Russia, entrenched in Ukraine, scaled down its involvement. Iran, facing internal unrest and regional conflicts, had less capacity to provide fresh manpower. Hezbollah, weakened by its own costly entanglements and recent conflict with Israel, could not offer the robust support it once did. Reports even suggested that Ukrainian intelligence assisted opposition factions in Idlib with training, though this remained unverified. The conditions were ripe for a major push that could uproot the government’s hold.\n\n**The Offensive Begins (November 27-29, 2024)**\n\nOn November 27, 2024, HTS announced an operation it called “Deterrence of Aggression.” Rebels attacked positions of the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) in the western Aleppo countryside, claiming it was a direct response to government shelling that had killed civilians in Idlib. Soon, other opposition groups joined, including Turkish-backed elements of the Syrian National Army (SNA) and the SDF, which controlled significant territory in the northeast. Initially, some observers doubted these disparate factions could coordinate, but they showed an unusual degree of unity.\n\nDuring the first hours, HTS seized over a dozen villages and towns in western Aleppo Province. Fighters surrounded a key government base and captured it shortly thereafter. According to activists and observers, the regime’s defensive lines, stretched thin after years of attrition, began to buckle. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported heavy casualties on both sides. Government forces tried to slow the rebel advance with artillery and Russian jets conducted airstrikes. But these strikes failed to stop the coalition’s momentum.\n\nThe offensive quickly spread beyond Aleppo. On November 28, HTS-led groups moved into eastern Idlib countryside, taking villages close to the M5 highway, a strategic route previously secured by government troops. Other rebel factions, including smaller Islamist formations, joined the push. Reports indicated that Iranian-backed combatants suffered losses near Aleppo, including a high-ranking officer. Civilians suffered too, with Russian jets allegedly bombing Al Atārib, Darat Izza, and other towns.\n\nThe following day, November 29, rebels pressed forward. New territory fell at a rapid pace. By the close of the day, they had reached key nodes in both Aleppo and Idlib Provinces, causing government forces to withdraw. As one opposition spokesperson argued, the regime had built a “house of cards” that could not withstand a coordinated assault.\n\n**The Fall of Aleppo (November 29-30, 2024)**\n\nThe capture of Aleppo city was the turning point. Once Syria’s commercial hub, Aleppo had experienced severe fighting over the years. Assad’s forces, assisted by Iranian and Russian support, recaptured it in 2016, dealing a devastating blow to the rebellion. For many Syrians, Aleppo’s loss back then symbolized the rebellion’s near-defeat. But eight years later, the city proved vulnerable.\n\nOn November 29, rebels launched a large-scale assault on Aleppo city itself. They infiltrated neighborhoods, used car bombs to breach defenses, and by nightfall had established footholds in several districts. Government units, already under pressure in the countryside, began to disintegrate. Some soldiers reportedly abandoned uniforms to blend into the civilian population. Others fled toward as-Safirah or Aleppo airport. Although Russian and Syrian airstrikes tried to halt the surge, they did not prevent the rebels from capturing strategic districts. One government supporter on state TV promised swift reinforcements and blamed Turkey for backing the insurgents, but such pledges proved empty.\n\nBy early morning on November 30, the rebels had taken Aleppo’s historic citadel and key government installations. The city fell almost completely into their hands as soldiers loyal to Assad retreated. Meanwhile, the SDF seized the chance to gain ground. The SDF entered neighborhoods vacated by government troops and secured areas such as Shaykh Najjar. Iranian personnel, suddenly exposed, either withdrew or surrendered. Pro-government forces struggled to regroup, leaving behind heavy weaponry: modern tanks, anti-aircraft systems, and aircraft on the ground. Video footage shared online showed rebels posing with captured war matériel.\n\n## Give the gift of hope\n\n###### We practice what we preach:\n\naccurate, fearless journalism.

Save democracy.\n\nWith Aleppo gone, Assad’s forces lost their largest foothold in northern Syria, undermining the regime’s control and morale. The once-vaunted army that had retaken the city in 2016 could not stand its ground in 2024.\n\n**Pivot to Central and Eastern Syria (November 30–December 5, 2024)**\n\nAs November ended, rebels advanced southward. The coalition moved out from Idlib and Aleppo into Hama and Homs. The SDF opened a new front in the east, capturing Deir ez-Zur on December 6 after pro-government units withdrew. Simultaneously, Southern Front fighters attacked from the south, entering Suwayda and Daraa. The US-backed Syrian Free Army (SFA) took Palmyra in the southeast, exploiting the vacuum left as regime forces pulled back.\n\nEach day brought new gains. On December 1, Russia intensified airstrikes in an attempt to slow the rebel wave, targeting areas in Hama and Idlib. But these raids did not achieve lasting results. Opposition groups kept pressing forward, taking advantage of collapsing defenses. On December 3, they pushed toward Hama city, capturing numerous towns along the way and cutting key supply lines. Civilians, caught in the crossfire, sought refuge wherever they could. Occasional rebel shelling killed people inside regime-held territories. Russian and government bombs fell on towns recently gained by the opposition, causing further civilian casualties.\n\nBy December 5, Hama, a historically significant city that witnessed early protests against Assad in the 1980s and again in 2011, fell into opposition hands. After that, rebel brigades turned their attention to Homs, an important junction city that connected Damascus to the coast. Without Homs, the government would lose its ability to supply its strongholds in Latakia and Tartus, where Russia maintained a naval base. Defenders in Homs were poorly positioned to resist. Rumors spread that Hezbollah, previously a key ally of Assad, was sending reinforcements from Lebanon. But Hezbollah itself had been weakened by its costly engagements and recent losses against Israel. It could offer only limited support.\n\nThe once formidable pro-government frontlines crumbled. Evidence suggested many units were hollow formations with limited loyalty to Assad. Corruption had led to disarray, and some enlisted men felt no cause worth dying for. By December 6, rebels took much of Homs, cutting Damascus off from Syria’s coast and the Russian bases there. Simultaneously, the SDF and others consolidated control over Deir ez-Zur and Palmyra. The regime’s presence in the east and south vanished almost overnight.\n\n**Racing Toward Damascus (December 7-8, 2024)**\n\nThe final push targeted Damascus, Syria’s capital and Assad’s seat of power. On December 7, Southern Front groups advanced through Rif Dimashq from the south, reaching suburbs less than 6 miles from the city center. Opposition forces also approached from the north after capturing Homs. Reports indicated that pro-government soldiers, sensing the end, abandoned their checkpoints. The SFA entered from the southeast. By December 8, rebels had reached central neighborhoods. Sounds of gunfire filled the early morning air. Locals witnessed a surreal scene: fighters toppling statues of the Assad family and tearing down portraits of Bashar Assad.\n\nPrime Minister al-Jalali, who remained in the country, announced that he was ready “to cooperate with any leadership chosen by Syrians” and that he hoped Syria “could be a normal country that builds good relations with its neighbors and the world.”\n\nMeanwhile, amid the collapse, speculation swirls over Assad’s fate. His family has fled the country, reportedly to Russia.\n\nOn December 8, a Syrian Air Ilyushin Il-76 transport jet, flight 9218, disappeared from radar shortly after departing Damascus. The flight, which had no listed destination, traveled toward Syria’s Mediterranean coast before abruptly reversing course near Homs and disappearing. Some analysts suggest Assad may have been aboard the aircraft, seeking refuge abroad, presumably also in Russia, which maintains a naval base at Tartus. However, the flight’s fate remains unknown, and no confirmation has been provided regarding Assad’s location.\n\nPrisons like Sednaya, infamous for torture and extrajudicial detentions, were opened by the rebels, allowing freed inmates to return to their communities. Emotional scenes unfolded as detainees reunited with families, friends, and neighbors.\n\n**Reaction and Strategic Implications**\n\nThe SAA called the offensive “a huge and large-scale terrorist attack,” insisting that large numbers of hostile fighters, “using medium and heavy weapons,” overran positions. Yet the government’s narrative had lost credibility. Officials who remained in Syria acknowledged their isolation. Despite Russia’s initial involvement in bombing rebel areas, Moscow refrained from committing ground forces. Russian warships began leaving Tartus on December 2, signaling an unwillingness to get drawn deeper into an unwinnable situation.\n\nIran, for decades a key backer of Assad, began evacuating personnel and pulling out senior officials. Iranian state media shifted its language. At first it condemned the operation as “a plot orchestrated by the US and the Zionist regime.” Soon after, it stopped calling the insurgents “terrorists,” referring to them simply as armed groups. Tehran’s priorities changed. With the war’s outcome all but decided, it made little sense to invest further resources. Iranian leaders, facing regional pressures, did not want to get entangled in a lost cause.\n\nThe United States distanced itself. “The United States has nothing to do with this offensive, which is led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a designated terrorist organization,” said White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett. President-elect Donald Trump also commented that the US should not intervene, stating it was “not our fight.” Western powers had not supported HTS, given its extremist background, but they also did not rush to prop up Assad’s regime. Washington feared the potential reemergence of extremist threats if the new power vacuum allowed radical groups to flourish. Yet officials also recognized that Assad, considered deeply repressive, had become a liability for any hope of future stability.\n\nIsrael, watching closely from the Golan Heights, deployed additional forces along the border to prevent spillover violence. It also conducted airstrikes on Hezbollah positions to stop the group’s attempts to reinforce the collapsing Syrian Army. The Israeli government wanted to prevent Iran-backed factions from seizing strategic opportunities to move arms near Israeli-controlled territory.\n\nTurkey’s role remained somewhat ambiguous. While the opposition’s successful campaign took place during an era of Turkish influence, Ankara denied direct involvement in planning the advance. Still, Turkey benefited from a weaker Kurdish presence as the SDF became occupied fighting the government. The outcome may allow Turkey to reshuffle relationships in northern Syria and manage refugee flows better.\n\nMoammar al-Eryani, Yemen’s minister of information, culture, and tourism, asserted on the social media platform X that Iran’s abandonment of Assad, despite significant support over the years, highlights its declining regional influence. He noted that Tehran’s failure to protect Assad underscores the fragility of its alliances and signals a shift in its ability to project power in the region. He warned Yemenis that Iran would likely abandon Abdul-Malik al-Houthi and the Houthis as well and urged unity to reclaim Yemen’s sovereignty.\n\nAnalysts debated the reasons for the regime’s sudden downfall. Some pointed to a hollowed-out army, rampant corruption, and a failing economy. Others blamed the absence of Iranian and Russian ground support. Another theory focused on timing: Rebels struck while Russia and Iran were distracted, and Assad’s government had done little to strengthen itself after the 2020 cease-fire. The fall of Damascus shook old assumptions that the regime would endure indefinitely.\n\n**A New Landscape for Syria**\n\nWith Assad gone and the opposition in control, questions loom about what Syria’s governance will look like. HTS, while instrumental in toppling Assad, remains a designated terrorist organization. Its dominance in the coalition troubles many Syrians and international observers who fear a repressive Islamist rule. Yet other groups—moderate rebels, local councils, and even technocrats—may push for more inclusive governance. The presence of the SDF, which advocates a decentralized model respecting Kurdish and minority rights, could also shape the country’s political future.\n\nIn the short term, basic services and institutions remain intact. To avoid chaos, the rebels allowed Prime Minister Jalali to stay and supervise the bureaucracy temporarily. His statement—hoping Syria “could be a normal country that builds good relations with its neighbors and the world”—suggested a desire for diplomatic ties and economic recovery. Whether international recognition follows depends on how the victorious factions behave. Will they unify under a transitional body acceptable to Syrians of different ethnicities, sects, and political orientations?\n\nFor everyday Syrians, the war’s conclusion promises relief from constant shelling, sieges, and displacement. Yet families remain scarred by loss. Uncertainty prevails about the fate of minorities, the role of Shia and Alawite communities who long supported the regime, and how to address abuses committed by all sides. The question of accountability looms large. Many Syrians want trials or truth commissions for war crimes. Others just want to rebuild homes, find missing relatives, and restore normalcy. The collapse of Assad’s government ends one chapter, but healing the country after more than a decade of bloodshed is a monumental task.\n\n**International Interests and Future Alignments**\n\nRussia’s naval base in Tartus and airbase near Latakia were crucial to its Middle East ambitions. With rebels blocking access routes, Moscow may face tough negotiations to retain a presence. A weakened Russia, focused on Ukraine and wary of overextension, might strike deals with opposition leaders or withdraw personnel to avoid entanglement. Iran, similarly, must decide whether to abandon its influence or attempt to reconnect with local proxies from abroad. Hezbollah, reeling from battles elsewhere, no longer has the manpower or popular support to project power in Syria.\n\nFor the region, Syria’s transformation changes the strategic map. Turkey may seek ties with the new authorities to curb Kurdish autonomy and manage trade. Jordan and Lebanon, both hosting large Syrian refugee populations, may look for ways to facilitate returns if stability takes hold. The Gulf States might offer reconstruction funds, hoping to gain influence. The European Union and the US may link rebuilding assistance to political reforms and the inclusion of diverse communities in governance.\n\n**Fears of Extremist Resurgence**\n\nAnother pressing concern is whether the rapid upheaval leaves space for extremist groups, including remnants of the Islamic State group, to reemerge. The opposition coalition included various Islamists, but its broad-based nature might limit the influence of the most hardline elements. International actors have already warned they will strike jihadist leaders if they use Syria as a base for attacks abroad. The rebels, keenly aware of the risk of international isolation, may try to marginalize extremist factions to gain legitimacy.\n\nHTS’s leader Jolani, while stating “This operation broke the enemy,” also described the aim as freeing Syria from an “oppressive regime.” Past attempts by HTS to distance itself from transnational jihadism suggest it may now try to position itself as a local power player, not a global menace. Whether this effort convinces Western states remains uncertain.\n\n**A Turning Point in a 13-Year Crisis**\n\nThe events of late November and early December 2024 will be remembered as the final act in a long, brutal conflict. The speed of the collapse stunned observers. After years of grinding attrition, shifting alliances, and foreign interventions, Syria’s fate changed in less than two weeks. The toppled regime once considered immutable fell victim to a combination of internal decay and external neglect.\n\nAs the dust settles, Syrians face a new era. They must define how to govern without descending into infighting or repressing vulnerable communities. They must rebuild cities like Aleppo, Homs, and Hama, once thriving centers of commerce and culture now lying in ruins. They must integrate refugees and displaced people, mend sectarian divides, and restore trust in public institutions.\n\nThe international community stands on the sidelines, uncertain about how to engage. While no foreign power wants a resurgence of chaos, few are eager to sink more resources into a shattered country. For Syrians, this moment offers a chance to emerge from the shadow of authoritarian rule and foreign-sponsored militarization. The path will be uneven and fraught with danger, but it also presents opportunities for reconciliation, reconstruction, and a more representative governance model.\n\nIn time, the narrative will solidify.

Now, with rebel militants in control, Ms. Abou Zainedin is working on the country’s delicate political transformation.\n\n“I’m very excited but also very overwhelmed. It’s an amazing feeling.” When Sawsan Abou Zainedin fled Bashar al-Assad’s rule more than a decade ago, she thought she might never return. Now, after the fall of the regime, she’s headed to her hometown in southern Syria to see her father for the first time in seven years. While scenes of celebration like these take place across the country, there’s also concern about what’s to come. “We cannot topple a dictator regime to go under a different one. These few months are fundamental, not just in our lives as individuals but also in the life of this country.” Abou Zainedin says her political activism against the former government landed her in trouble, narrowly escaping arrest. As part of the wave of six million Syrians who fled during the 13-year civil war, she sought asylum in the United Kingdom. She now leads a network of organizations that support legal and political rights for all Syrians. “Syria is ours and is not the property of the Assad family. We will not rest until we claim back our state of citizenship and democracy.” Abou Zainedin grew up here in the Suwayda district, home to a large Druse community, one of Syria’s many minority religious groups. It was also one of the first places where the uprising against Assad began in 2011. Many here want to see a secular state that protects the interests of Syria’s diverse population. In early December, rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or H.T.S., overthrew five decades of Assad family rule. H.T.S. is an Islamist group formerly affiliated with Al Qaeda. Since toppling the Assad regime, the group’s leader, Ahmed al-Shara, has signaled an openness to a more inclusive government. People in Abou Zainedin’s hometown remain cautious. At a meeting with the spiritual leader of the Druse in Syria, concerns about the new chapter quickly surface. “We have achieved something we all thought it was impossible to achieve. But lots of work lies ahead of us still. We are definitely going to engage with the interim government, and we’re hoping that they will be responsive to this.” What will happen next under H.T.S. leadership is unknown, but for now the celebration continues.\n\n\n# Ten Years Later, a Political Exile Returns to a Syria in Transition\n\nIn 2014, Sawsan Abou Zainedin left Syria during a civil war, while Bashar al-Assad was in power.

        "content": "On April 13, 1975, a busload of Palestinian civilians was ambushed in Ain al-Rummaneh, a predominantly Maronite Christian neighborhood in East Beirut, by Phalangist militiamen who committed a massacre. That moment, often cited as the spark of the Lebanese Civil War, did not emerge from a vacuum — it followed years of tension between the Lebanese state, sectarian militias, and the growing Palestinian armed presence in Lebanon, which started in 1971 when the PLO arrived after being forcibly expelled by the Jordanian state following the events of Black September.\n\nFifty years have passed, and the debate over the role of Palestinians — specifically Palestinian factions under the PLO — in the Lebanese Civil War remains mired in a murky combination of emotions, facts, myths, scapegoating, and to some extent, political erasure. Yet the story of the Palestinian *fedayeen*, the armed guerillas of the PLO and its associated factions, is integral to understanding their presence in the Lebanese Civil War itself. Their story of resistance, exile, and survival is essential to appreciating the systemic marginalization that Palestinians have faced in Lebanon from that period to the present day.\n\n**Revolutionaries-in-exile**\n\nAfter 1967, the PLO — and especially its largest party, Fatah, under the leadership of Yasser Arafat — gained significant influence across the Arab world, including within Jordan, where a large number of Palestinian refugees lived. Many of these refugees were housed in camps around the country, where the PLO operated with increasing autonomy, building parallel institutions and maintaining armed factions of *fedayeen*. It was this increasingly uncomfortable reality for the Jordanian monarchy that led to what Palestinians refer to as the Black September War.\n\nThe arrival of the Palestinian *fedayeen* in Lebanon in 1971 reshaped the country’s internal dynamics. With the Lebanese state unable or unwilling to absorb the Palestinian refugee population into its social and political fabric, the camps became self-sufficient, heavily policed, and politically radicalized. The PLO, especially Fatah, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the PFLP-GC (General Command), and other leftist factions turned southern Lebanon and parts of West Beirut into what was often described by Western journalists as “Fatahland” — a semi-autonomous zone from which operations against Israel could be launched. These journalists today are the ones who love to call any area where the Shia in Lebanon reside as a “Hezbollah stronghold.” The Fakhani neighborhood in West Beirut housing the PLO’s headquarters was commonly known as the “Fakhani Republic,” where the PLO functioned as a state-within-a-state.\n\nFor many Palestinian refugees living decades in exile in Lebanon, joining the Palestinian armed struggle in Lebanon was both a political necessity and a personal one. Stateless and under siege, they saw their fight not only as a battle against Israel but also as part of a broader anticolonial movement spanning the Arab world and beyond.\n\nI interviewed countless former Palestinian *fedayeen* during my PhD fieldwork over many years, and I would always ask them what had motivated them to join. The most common answer was always, “With Fatah, we had hope that we could free our country.”\n\nI recall one particular interview with a Palestinian *fedayi* originally from Nablus who led a battalion of *fedayeen* in South Lebanon for several years. He told me, “Fatah was organized and we trusted they had a plan. Of course, we wanted to free our country. There was dignity in that. There was no dignity in being a refugee.”\n\nDuring the PLO’s heyday in Lebanon, its military and symbolic presence in the country, especially in Beirut, is now recalled as legendary by the elders in the camps. Posters of strength, of slogans, of images depicting victory, were seen not only all over West Beirut but across leftist spaces in the global south. When Fatah was strong, elders recount how it offered Palestinians in Lebanon a semblance of dignity in an otherwise precarious existence. However, to many Lebanese factions, particularly the Kataeb — the Phalangist party of the Christian far right — the Palestinian presence in Lebanon was perceived as a threat to national sovereignty and demographic balance.\n\n**Scapegoats**\n\nFrom the start of the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian factions were framed by many groups as instigators and outsiders who had brought foreign wars into Lebanese soil — in reference to the PLO’s battle with Israel along South Lebanon’s borders. But this portrayal of the Palestinians in Lebanon also ignored the complex sectarian tensions and systemic inequities that had long plagued the Lebanese political order. Yet it was politically convenient.\n\nFawwaz Traboulsi, author of the widely cited *A History of Modern Lebanon*, said the Ain al-Rumman massacre was not the cause of the war, “but its pretext.” Traboulsi argues that the confrontation was long in the making, “rooted in unresolved class contradictions, sectarian anxiety, and the failure of the Lebanese state to adapt to changing regional and domestic realities.”\n\nThe Kataeb militiamen’s massacre was framed as retaliation for an earlier attack on Pierre Gemayel, their Maronite leader. Whether or not Palestinians were responsible remains disputed, but what followed was a devastating spiral: Christian militias targeted Palestinian civilians, PLO fighters responded, and within weeks, Beirut was split into a patchwork of armed zones.\n\nThe late Lebanese historian and journalist Samir Kassir said that the Civil War did not begin because of the Palestinians, but “because of what Lebanon had refused to address for decades — inequality, sectarian fear, and a ruling class willing to let the country burn rather than share power.”\n\nWhat followed over the next 15 years was a brutal civil war in which Palestinian refugee communities came under continuous attack. The 1976 Tel al-Zaatar massacre, in which thousands of Palestinian refugees were killed by rightwing militias after a prolonged siege, underscored the ferocity of anti-Palestinian violence. The 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon culminated in the Sabra and Shatila massacre, where Christian Lebanese Phalangists — under the watch of the Israeli army — massacred thousands of civilians in the camps.\n\nThe late British journalist Robert Fisk, a longtime Beirut resident, was one of the first Western reporters to enter Sabra and Shatila after the massacre in September 1982. His description of what he saw remains haunting to this day:\n\n“I had never seen anything like it. There were women lying in houses with their skirts torn up to their waists and their legs spread apart, children with their throats cut, rows of young men shot in the back after being lined up at an execution wall. There were babies – blackened babies – because they had been slaughtered more than 24 hours earlier and their small bodies were already in a state of decomposition”\n\n\nDespite these atrocities, Palestinians have often been reduced to players in broader Lebanese historiography — present mainly when blamed, invisible when grieving. Rosemary Sayigh, a British-born anthropologist and one of the foremost scholars of Palestinian refugee experiences in Lebanon, says Palestinians have largely been characterized as a “problem” in Lebanon, with their narratives “of dispossession, resistance, and repeated victimization” ignored and relegated to the margins. “When violence is enacted against them, they are largely invisible; when accused of provoking violence, they dominate the frame,” Sayigh writes.\n\n**Memory and myth**\n\nToday, the memory of Palestinian involvement in the Lebanese Civil War is a fragmented one. In some Lebanese political narratives, the PLO is cast as a destabilizing force that brought the country to ruin. In others, particularly among leftist circles, Palestinian fighters are remembered as comrades in a shared revolutionary front against imperialism and sectarianism. Among Palestinians themselves, the memory is more personal — shaped by loss, longing, and a mixture of inherited, lived, unresolved, and compounded trauma.\n\nToday there are officially 12 Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon: 3 in Beirut, 5 in South Lebanon, Dbayeh Camp in the Mount Lebanon area north of Beirut, and Weivel Camp in Baalbek in the Beqaa Valley. There are several additional unofficial Palestinian “gatherings,” as they are referred to throughout the country. During the Lebanese Civil War, at least five other camps were either destroyed or forcibly dismantled — Tal al-Zaater and Khaldeh are the most widely known.\n\nPart of the reason that conditions in the other already crowded camps became so dire in the years that followed is that they absorbed the twice-displaced residents of the destroyed camps into their own.\n\nI recall, in the summer of 2009, being taken on a walk by a Palestinian friend through the ruins of Ouzai — the dilapidated coastal neighborhood of South Beirut, which is visible when planes land in Beirut. That area used to boast luxury beach resorts, which were destroyed during the Lebanese Civil War. My friend’s family, while historically from Acre, Palestine, had settled in Tal al-Zaatar camp. After the camp was destroyed in 1976, they and many other families displaced from Tal al-Zaatar, built shelters and eventually homes on the ruins of the luxury hotels. I visited his house — a poorly constructed two-story lodging, in a cluster of the same, less than 100 meters from the sea. He recounts growing up during the Civil War playing soccer on the beach every day.\n\nLebanon’s Palestinian refugee camps, gatherings, and informal communities are simultaneously incredible repositories of memory, and living memorials of a past that has never ended. Graffiti of martyrs, community centers with fading posters, and children’s artwork generated through some foreign NGO’s art workshops can be found in every camp in Lebanon. So can groups of older men who were once hopeful but now sit together drinking coffee. Surrounded by clouds of cigarette smoke, they can be seen around every corner. These camps carry decades of history absent from textbooks in the schools. After all, Lebanon hasn’t had an updated, unified history curriculum since the 1970s. Every attempt to update the history books has failed due to political disagreements over what should be included. This means sensitive issues like the Palestinian refugee presence in the country, and the Lebanese Civil War are left out or glossed over to avoid stirring controversy.\n\nYet remembering alone cannot compensate for structural marginalization. Palestinians in Lebanon are still denied basic rights: they cannot own property, face restrictions in over 70 professions, and live in deteriorating camp conditions due to the state’s policy not to integrate them. The goal of such a policy is that the refugees go back to where they came from. Despite contributing to Lebanon’s labor force for decades, they remain politically and economically disenfranchised. As of March 2023, UNRWA reports approximately 489,292 registered Palestine refugees in Lebanon. I often hear people say that actual numbers may be less now due to unreported migration, although significantly less seems unlikely.\n\n**From past to present**\n\nThe echoes of the Lebanese Civil War still reverberate today, not only in Beirut’s urban ruins but also in the lived experience of Palestinians who remain refugees two and three generations later. Many of the grievances that drove Palestinians to take up arms in the 1970s — statelessness, exclusion, Israeli aggression — are still a reality for them today.\n\nOctober 7, 2023, was an undeniable turning point in the history of the Palestinian liberation struggle.\n\nEvery day since then, as Gaza burns under siege and genocide and West Bank cities face settler violence and military raids, the image of the Palestinian fighter has reentered the public imagination.\n\nBut this time it’s different; it’s not the *fedayi* in the keffiyeh, but the black-masked Hamas fighters who are celebrated as heroes for many of the Palestinians in Lebanon’s camps.\n\nFor decades, the camps in Lebanon were covered in photos and posters of Arafat, and Fatah flags and slogans. That iconography and those images represented hope and strength to the Palestinians during the Lebanese Civil War due to the strength of the Palestinian armed struggle, and since the Civil War, due to longing and nostalgia for the golden years of the Palestinian armed struggle.\n\nBut things have changed, and Hamas support is visibly more pronounced in the camps. A few weeks ago I briefly visited the Burj al-Barajneh camp in Beirut and couldn’t help but notice the images of Hamas and the late Hamas Politburo head, Ismail Haniyeh, around the camp, alongside and sometimes instead of images from a more distant past. To the young men and women in the camps now, Hamas represents a renewed hope that their homeland can be liberated and that the Palestinian struggle is not dead.\n\n**Toward reckoning**\n\nAs Lebanon marks the 50th anniversary of the war, reckoning with the Palestinian dimension is essential — not just as a historical footnote, but as a window into how stateless people navigate the violent political landscapes.\n\nThe story of the Palestinians in Lebanon is not one of pure victimhood or romanticized resistance. It is a story with many contradictions: of being guests in a host country, of being feared. Of being forgotten.\n\nI often think of the work of the gifted photographer Dalia Khamissy, who has been working on her powerful ongoing project on the Missing of Lebanon for the past 15 years. For this project, she has meticulously documented and told the stories of the estimated 17,000 people who went missing during the Lebanese Civil War. She has given a voice to countless mothers whose loved ones went out during the war and never came home. To this day, they wait for them. For many, the Lebanese Civil War never ended.\n\n**Sabah Haider**\n\nSabah Haider is a visual anthropologist and journalist based between Beirut and Paris.",

        "content": "# Syrian rebels topple Assad who flees to Russia in Mideast shakeup\n\nDAMASCUS, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Syrian rebels seized the capital Damascus unopposed on Sunday after a lightning advance that sent President Bashar al-Assad fleeing to Russia after a 13-year civil war and six decades of his family's autocratic rule.\n\nIn one of the biggest turning points for the Middle East in generations, the fall of Assad's government wiped out a bastion from which Iran and Russia exercised influence across the Arab world. Moscow gave asylum to Assad and his family, Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's ambassador to international organizations in Vienna, said on his Telegram channel.\n\nSign up here.\n\nHis sudden overthrow, at the hands of a revolt partly backed by Turkey and with roots in jihadist Sunni Islam, limits Iran's ability to spread weapons to its allies and could cost Russia its Mediterranean naval base. It could allow millions of refugees scattered for more than a decade in camps across Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan to finally return home.\n\nFor Syrians, it brought a sudden unexpected end to a war in deep freeze for years, with hundreds of thousands dead, cities pounded to dust and an economy hollowed by global sanctions.\n\n\"How many people were displaced across the world? How many people lived in tents? How many drowned in the seas?\" the top rebel commander, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, told a huge crowd at the medieval Umayyad Mosque in central Damascus, referring to refugees who died trying to reach Europe.\n\n\"A new history, my brothers, is being written in the entire region after this great victory,\" he said, adding that with hard work Syria would be \"a beacon for the Islamic nation.\"\n\nThe Assad police state - known since his father seized power in the 1960s as one of the harshest in the Middle East with hundreds of thousands of political prisoners - melted away overnight.\n\nBewildered and elated inmates poured out of jails after rebels blasted open their cells. Reunited families wept in joy. Newly freed prisoners were filmed at dawn running through the Damascus streets holding up the fingers of both hands to show how many years they had been in prison.\n\n\"We toppled the regime!\" a voice shouted as one prisoner yelled and skipped with delight.\n\nThe White Helmets rescue organization said it had dispatched five emergency teams to the notorious Sedhaya prison to search for hidden underground cells believed to hold detainees.\n\n## DEFACED ASSAD IMAGES\n\nAs the sun set in Damascus without Assad for the first time, roads leading into the city were mostly empty, apart from motorcycles carrying armed men and rebel vehicles caked with mud as camouflage.\n\nSome men could be seen looting a shopping centre on the road between the capital and the Lebanese border. The myriad checkpoints lining the road to Damascus were empty. Posters of Assad were torn at his eyes. A burning Syrian military truck was parked diagonally on the road out of the city.\n\nA thick column of black smoke billowed from the Mazzeh neighbourhood, where Israeli strikes earlier had targeted Syrian state security branches, according to two security sources.\n\nIntermittent gunfire rang out in apparent celebration.\n\nShops and restaurants closed early in line with a curfew imposed by the rebels. Just before it came into effect, people could be seen briskly walking home with stacks of bread.\n\nEarlier, the rebels said they had entered the capital with no sign of army deployments. Thousands of people in cars and on foot congregated at a main square in Damascus waving and chanting \"Freedom.\"\n\nPeople were seen walking inside the Al-Rawda Presidential Palace, with some leaving carrying furniture. A motorcycle was parked on the intricately-laid parquet floor of a gilded hall.\n\nThe Syrian rebel coalition said it was working to complete the transfer of power to a transitional governing body with executive powers.\n\n\"The great Syrian revolution has moved from the stage of struggle to overthrow the Assad regime to the struggle to build a Syria together that befits the sacrifices of its people,\" it added in a statement.\n\nMohammad Ghazi al-Jalali, prime minister under Assad, called for free elections and said he had been in contact with Golani to discuss the transitional period.\n\nGolani, whose group was once Syria's branch of al Qaeda but has softened its image to reassure members of minority sects and foreign countries, said there was no room for turning back.\n\n## ARAB WORLD STUNNED\n\nThe pace of events stunned Arab capitals and raised concerns about more instability on top of the Gaza war.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, in a televised address, cheered Assad's fall but acknowledged that it was also a moment of risk and uncertainty.\n\n\"As we all turn to the question of what comes next, the United States will work with our partners and the stakeholders in Syria to help them seize an opportunity to manage the risk,\" Biden said.\n\nThe U.S. Central Command said its forces conducted dozens of airstrikes targeting known Islamic State camps and operatives in central Syria on Sunday.\n\nLater in the day Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said he spoke with Turkish Minister of National Defense Yasar Guler, emphasizing that the United States is watching closely.\n\nJubilant supporters of the revolt crowded Syrian embassies around the world, lowering red, white and black Assad-era flags and replacing them with the green, white and black flag flown by his opponents.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Assad's fall was thanks to blows Israel had dealt to Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, once the lynchpin of Assad's security forces.\n\n\"The barbaric state has fallen,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said.\n\nWhen the celebrations fade, Syria's new leaders face the daunting task of trying to deliver stability to a diverse country that will need billions of dollars in aid.\n\nDuring the civil war, which erupted in 2011 as an uprising against Assad, his forces and their Russian allies bombed cities to rubble. The refugee crisis across the Middle East was one of the biggest of modern times and caused a political reckoning in Europe when a million people arrived in 2015.\n\nIn recent years Turkey had backed some rebels in a small redoubt in the northwest and along its border. The United States, which still has 900 soldiers on the ground, backed a Kurdish-led alliance that fought Islamic State jihadists from 2014-2017.\n\nThe biggest strategic losers were Russia and Iran, which intervened in the war's early years to rescue Assad, helping him recapture most territory and all major cities. The front lines were frozen four years ago under a deal Russia and Iran reached with Turkey.\n\nBut Moscow's focus on its war in Ukraine and the blows to Iran's allies following the war in Gaza - particularly the decimation of Hezbollah by Israel over the past two months - left Assad with scant support.\n\nReporting by Maya Gebeily and Timour Azhari in Damascus, Suleiman al-Khalidi in Amman, Tom Perry and Laila Bassam in Beirut, Jaidaa Taha and Adam Makary in Cairo, Clauda Tanios, Nadine Awadallah and Tala Ramadan in Dubai Writing by Michael Perry, Michael Georgy, Peter Graff, Phil Stewart, Patricia Zengerle Editing by Philippa Fletcher, Andrew Cawthorne, Frances Kerry and Lisa Shumaker\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

        "content": "**Iran Update, December 7, 2024**\n\n**Johanna Moore, Alexandra Braverman, Annika Ganzev and Nick Carl**\n\n**Information Cutoff: 3:00 pm ET**\n\n*The Critical Threats Project (CTP) at the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) publish the Iran Update, which provides insights into Iranian and Iranian-sponsored activities that undermine regional stability and threaten US forces and interests.*\n\n*Click **here** to see CTP and ISW’s interactive map of Israeli ground operations, and **here** to see CTP and ISW’s interactive map of the ongoing opposition offensive in Syria. These maps are updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.*\n\n*We do not report in detail on war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.*\n\n**The Bashar al Assad regime faces imminent collapse. **The Syrian Arab Army (SAA) appears to have already collapsed itself, as its units have fled repeatedly from advancing opposition forces across the country. The SAA is combat ineffective and has yet to present a meaningful defense against the advancing opposition. The opposition forces led by Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS) have exploited the collapse of the SAA by advancing further southward and taking control of Homs City, which is the last major obstacle before Damascus. Various opposition groups have similarly taken control of large swaths of central and southern Syria and begun advancing into the southern and eastern outskirts of Damascus. The Assad regime appears to only control parts of Damascus and the western Syrian coast at the time of this writing. Syrian President Bashar al Assad has been entirely absent through the crisis and has refrained from making any public address.[1] Some unverified reports have suggested that Assad has fled, possibly to Iran.[2]\n\nIran appears unwilling to intervene militarily at any meaningful scale to support the Assad regime at this time. Iranian-backed forces have avoided engaging opposition forces almost entirely. The *New York Times *reported that an internal Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) memo acknowledged the growing likelihood that the Assad regime will collapse.[3] It is far from clear, moreover, that Iran could mobilize the forces necessary to save Assad at this point anyway. Iran has launched an emergency evacuation of its diplomatic staff and military officers from Damascus.[4] Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called for political dialogue with the opposition, reflecting heightened Iranian concerns about the longevity of the Assad regime.[5] This Iranian concern and inaction come amid reports that Russia is similarly unwilling to intervene in support of Assad.[6]\n\n**HTS-led opposition forces seized Homs City.[7] **Opposition forces stated that they had full control of Homs City approximately an hour after announcing that they entered the city.[8] Opposition forces previously advanced to the city outskirts on December 6.[9] Western media and the HTS spokesperson reported that the SAA withdrew from Homs City and the surrounding neighborhoods before the opposition advance.[10] An SAA officer told Reuters that dozens of Hezbollah fighters retreated from Homs City after the SAA decided that it could not defend the city.[11] SAA commanders withdrew from Homs City via helicopter, while ground forces withdrew overland toward the Syrian coast.[12] HTS-led forces captured and freed 3,500 prisoners from the military prison in southern Homs City.[13] Retaining Homs City was key for regime survival because it connects Damascus to the western coast, which is a majority Alawaite area.[14] Assad is an Alawite and has significant support among the Alawite community in Syria..[15] Opposition forces took Hama City on December 5, only two days prior to their capture of Homs City.[16]\n\n**Local opposition forces took control of large swaths of Daraa, Quneitra, and Suwayda provinces in southwestern Syria and began advancing toward Damascus.[17] **Areas seized include Daraa, Quneitra, and Suwayda cities, as well as dozens of other towns and villages.[18] It is unclear to what extent—if any—these other opposition groups are coordinating with the HTS-led forces advancing southward from Idlib Province.\n\n**Syrian opposition forces captured Palmyra, Homs Province, after regime forces rapidly withdrew from positions throughout the central Syrian desert. **The Syrian opposition forces likely advanced northwards from the Al Tanf Deconfliction Zone and seized Palmyra.[19] These forces may continue to advance and capture other key points, including oil and gas infrastructure, in the central Syrian desert.[20] The United States backs the Syrian opposition forces based in the Al Tanf Deconfliction Zone.\n\nOpposition forces reportedly seized the towns of Darayya and al Moadamyeh immediately southwest of Damascus.[21] Al Moadamyeh is near the Mezzeh Military Airport. It is unclear whether opposition forces have taken control of the airport at the time of this writing. Opposition forces also reportedly seized Janarama, which is in the southeastern outskirts of Damascus.[22]\n\n**The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) clashed with the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) east of Aleppo City, northeastern Syria, on December 7. **An SNA operations room claimed that its forces clashed with the SDF in Manjib, northeast of Aleppo City.[23] An SNA operations room also claimed that the SNA seized Tal Aswad, south of Majib, from SDF and regime forces.[24] The SDF reported that it engaged the SNA forces Tal Aswad.[25] The SDF also engaged Turkish-backed forces in four separate villages northeast of Aleppo City on December 7.[26]\n\n**The SDF has expanded its control over former regime-held territory in eastern Syria since CTP-ISW’s last data cut off on December 6. **Footage posted on December 7 shows a convoy of SDF fighters entering Mayadin City.[27] Iranian-backed Iraqi militias reportedly withdrew from unspecified areas of Syria toward al Qaim, Iraq, amid reports that the SDF took control of the Albu Kamal border crossing**.[28]** Iranian-backed Afghan Fatemiyoun Division fighters also reportedly withdrew from Mayadin City on December 6.[29]\n\n**Unspecified US officials said that Turkey approved HTS launching its surprise offensive on November 27.[30] **Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed support for the HTS-led drive toward Damascus from the north.[31]\n\n**A prominent Iranian-backed Iraqi militia leader called on Iraqi militias to intervene in Syria to defend Bashar al Assad.[32]** Badr Organization Secretary General Hadi al Ameri claimed on December 7 that Iranian-backed Iraqi militias cannot “wait for [the Iraqi federal government] to escalate” against opposition forces.[33] Hundreds of Iranian-backed Iraqi fighters have reportedly deployed already to Syria to fight opposition forces.[34] CTP-ISW has yet to observe any engagements involving Iraqi militias, however. Reversing the advances of the opposition forces would be a major undertaking, moreover, and it is unlikely that Iranian-backed Iraqi militias can gather enough strength to do so.\n\n**The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) sent troops to assist UN forces under fire by gunmen around Hadera on the Syria-Golan Heights border on December 7.[35] **The IDF reported that ”armed individuals” shot at UN forces at the UN post near Hadera.[36] The IDF previously reinforced its positions in the Golan Heights on December 6 in response to the rapid gains by Syrian opposition forces.[37] The gunmen attacking the UN position came as opposition forces took control of much of the southern Daraa and Quneitra provinces.[38]\n\n*CTP-ISW is scaling back in today’s update its regular coverage of activity in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Lebanon, and the broader Middle East to focus on the rapidly evolving situation in Syria. We will resume regular coverage of these areas in the coming days.*\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n**Syria:**The Bashar al Assad regime faces imminent collapse. The SAA already appears to have collapsed itself. Iran and Russia appear unwilling to intervene militarily at a meaningful scale in support of Assad.**Syria:**Opposition groups took control of large swaths of Daraa, Homs, Quneitra, and Suwayda provinces. These forces then began advancing toward Damascus from its southern and northeastern flanks.**Syria:**The US-backed SDF clashed with the Turkish-backed SNA east of Aleppo City. The SDF separately expanded its control of formerly regime-held territory around the Euphrates River in eastern Syria.\n\n**Gaza Strip:**\n\n**Axis of Resistance objectives:**\n\n- Erode the will of the Israeli political establishment and public to sustain clearing operations in the Gaza Strip\n- Reestablish Hamas as the governing authority in the Gaza Strip\n\n**Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) fired a rocket targeting an IDF bulldozer in eastern Rafah City on December 6.[39]**\n\n**West Bank**\n\n**Axis of Resistance objectives:**\n\n- Establish the West Bank as a viable front against Israel\n\n*Nothing significant to report*\n\n**Northern Israel and Lebanon**\n\n**Lebanese Hezbollah objectives:**\n\n- End Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip\n- Survive the October 7 War as a capable political and military organization with control over Lebanon\n\n**The IDF conducted an airstrike on December 7 targeting a Lebanese Hezbollah fighter in Deir Seryan, southern Lebanon.[40] **The IDF reported that the fighter posed a threat to Israeli forces in the area.[41] The IDF reiterated its commitment to the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire agreement.[42]\n\n**Iran and the Axis of Resistance**\n\n**Nothing significant to report**\n\n*The Iran Update provides insights into Iranian and Iranian-sponsored activities abroad that undermine regional stability and threaten US forces and interests. It also covers events and trends that affect the stability and decision-making of the Iranian regime. The Critical Threats Project (CTP) at the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) provides these updates regularly based on regional events.*\n\n*CTP-ISW defines the “Axis of Resistance” as the unconventional alliance that Iran has cultivated in the Middle East since the Islamic Republic came to power in 1979. This transnational coalition is comprised of state, semi-state, and non-state actors that cooperate to secure their collective interests. Tehran considers itself to be both part of the alliance and its leader. Iran furnishes these groups with varying levels of financial, military, and political support in exchange for some degree of influence or control over their actions. Some are traditional proxies that are highly responsive to Iranian direction, while others are partners over which Iran exerts more limited influence. Members of the Axis of Resistance are united by their grand strategic objectives, which include eroding and eventually expelling American influence from the Middle East, destroying the Israeli state, or both. Pursuing these objectives and supporting the Axis of Resistance to those ends have become cornerstones of Iranian regional strategy.*\n\n[1] https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/syria-civil-war-12-07-2024-intl#cm4ehedbd002g3b6nxdwf2ltc\n\n[2] https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-07/syria-s-besieged-assad-makes-overtures-to-us-in-bid-to-survive?embedded-checkout=true\n\n[3] https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/world/middleeast/iran-syria-rebels.html\n\n[4] https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/07/israel-hamas-war-news-syria-gaza-lebanon/#link-JJGVY7IMFVB3BKFBZYDOFQKZHY ; https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/middleeast/iran-syria-evacuation.html\n\n[5] https://www.barrons.com/news/iran-fm-urges-political-dialogue-between-syria-govt-opposition-3af50c75\n\n[6] https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/syrian-rebels-eye-next-prize-while-assad-awaits-russia-and-iran\n\n[7] https://x.com/hasanabdalgany/status/1865520498135752979\n\n[8] https://x.com/hasanabdalgany/status/1865504605041299840 ; https://x.com/hasanabdalgany/status/1865520498135752979\n\n[9] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSnTeWSoP8&ab_channel=AlJazeeraMubasher%D9%82%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A9%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%B1 ; https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1088219522757320 ;\n\n[10] https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/syrian-troops-withdraw-south-country-rush-defend-homs-116552588 ; https://x.com/hasanabdalgany/status/1865507120445047209 ; https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-rebels-seize-fourth-city-close-homs-threat-assads-rule-2024-12-07/\n\n[11] https://www.timesofisrael dot com/liveblog_entry/dozens-of-hezbollah-fighters-flee-homs-as-rebels-close-in-says-syrian-army-officer/\n\n[12] https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-rebels-seize-fourth-city-close-homs-threat-assads-rule-2024-12-07/\n\n[13] https://x.com/hasanabdalgany/status/1865510550437822522\n\n[14] https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hama-homs.html\n\n[15] https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-rebels-seize-fourth-city-close-homs-threat-assads-rule-2024-12-07/\n\n[16] https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-6-2024\n\n[17] https://t.me/aleamaliaat_aleaskaria/256 ;\n\n[18] https://x.com/Asia_Intel/status/1865343031185903892 ;\n\nhttps://x.com/Zeldamices/status/1865322748483928275 ;\n\nhttps://x.com/ThomasVLinge/status/1865096728594022803 ;\n\n[19] https://x.com/OALD24/status/1865336748454097043; https://x.com/ThomasVLinge/status/1865349350290772454;\n\nhttps://x.com/TwistyCB/status/1865354368309989714; https://x.com/clashreport/status/1865340438971879689; https://x.com/DeirEzzore/status/1865344626883764432; https://t.me/wargonzo/23561\n\n[20] https://x.com/thiqanewsagency/status/1865336936249835740; https://x.com/Nuorgolan/status/1865325922305425462;\n\n[21] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olv_7E4Wz_0\n\n[22] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olv_7E4Wz_0\n\n[23] https://t.me/Dawn_of_Freedom1/228\n\n[24] https://t.me/Dawn_of_Freedom1/226\n\n[25] https://x.com/SiyamandAli/status/1865379051004723561\n\n[26] https://x.com/SiyamandAli/status/1865364826635239565\n\n[27] https://x.com/ThomasVLinge/status/1865167609865359455\n\n[28] https://www.shafaq dot com/ar/%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%80%D9%86/%D9%81%D8%B5%D8%A7-%D9%84-%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%AD%D8%A8-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7-%D9%85-%D9%88-%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%82%D8%B3%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%83%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84\n\n[29] https://x.com/nahermedia/status/1865011140398301456\n\n[30] https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index.html\n\n[31] https://www.aa dot com.tr/en/middle-east/turkiye-wishes-syrian-oppositions-march-to-continue-without-accidents-president-erdogan/3416234\n\n[32] https://t.me/platformB/3146\n\n[33] https://t.me/platformB/3146\n\n[34] https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iraqi-militias-enter-syria-reinforce-government-forces-military-sources-say-2024-12-02/\n\n[35] https://www.timesofisrael dot com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-it-is-aiding-un-forces-to-repel-attack-on-post-on-syrian-side-of-golan/\n\n[36] https://x.com/IDF/status/1865424194063700026\n\n[37] https://www.timesofisrael dot com/liveblog_entry/idf-again-shoring-up-forces-on-golan-as-syrian-rebels-take-area-close-to-border/\n\n[38] https://www.timesofisrael dot com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-it-is-aiding-un-forces-to-repel-attack-on-post-on-syrian-side-of-golan/\n\n[39] https://t.me/sarayaps/18899\n\n[40] https://x.com/idfonline/status/1865385848625131651 ; https://x.com/GLZRadio/status/1865348913504387089\n\n[41] https://x.com/GLZRadio/status/1865386598486987173\n\n[42] https://x.com/idfonline/status/1865385856392962457",

        "content": "# The Burning Heart of the World Follows an Armenian Family in Exile\n\n### Released on the 50th anniversary of the Lebanese Civil War and the 110th anniversary of the Armenian genocide, this heartfelt book weaves humor and love into a wartime coming-of-age story.\n\n#### Eleanor J. Bader\n\nNancy Kricorian’s latest novel, *The Burning Heart of the World*, is a powerfully spare, poetic evocation of the 15-year Lebanese Civil War (1975−1990) and its long-term impact on one Armenian family living in Beirut**. **It’s the fourth book in a series Kricorian calls the “Armenian diaspora quartet.” The book follows Vera, whose grandmother moved to Beirut after surviving the Armenian genocide—a three-year period from 1915-1918, during which the Ottoman Empire killed approximately 1.5 million people.\n\nDuring the Lebanese Civil War, Vera’s family flees to New York City; more than a decade later they witness the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. Though Vera grows to become a successful visual artist and married mother of twins living in Manhattan, neither she nor her parents have fully adjusted to life in the United States. “I came here like a wounded bird from a burning country,” her father tells her. “This is no country for humans. People work all the time. When they aren’t working, they lock themselves in their houses surrounded by white fences. It’s a land of the lonely.”\n\nNavigating this loneliness while trying to find one’s place is the core of *The Burning Heart of the World*. Released to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the start of the Lebanese Civil War and commemorate the 110th anniversary of the Armenian genocide, this beautiful, heartfelt book weaves humor, romantic foibles and love into a coming-of-age story that is a prayerful lament for the victims of war.\n\nI sat down with Kricorian to discuss the themes of displacement and community that give this story heft, and the invisible thread that links war to racial and religious animus.\n\n**Eleanor J. Bader: The transmission of generational trauma is one of the novel’s themes. From the Armenian genocide to the Lebanese Civil War to 9/11 in the United States, trauma is ever-present as people go about their daily lives. Why is this important to you?**\n\n**Nancy Kricorian: **Although I am interested in intergenerational trauma, I am also interested in the ways people remake their communities. On one hand, yes, the novel is about trauma, but on the other, it is about perseverance.\n\nI grew up in an Armenian community in Watertown, Massachusetts. We lived in a two-family house and my grandmother, who had survived the genocide, lived upstairs. We never spoke about it directly, but in my first novel, *Zabelle*, I refer to the unspoken residue of the genocide as living with “dead and rotting animals behind the walls.”\n\nWhen I was in college, I took a class on mothers and daughters in literature. One of the assignments was to conduct an oral history with a woman in our family. I went home and interviewed my grandmother who, for the first time, told me about what she called the “deportations” or the “massacres.” She never used the word genocide. My grandmother never told anyone in our family about being forced from her home and made to walk into the desert.\n\nShe ended up in a tent camp with 8,000 Armenian orphans in the desert outside the Syrian town of Ras al Ain and explained how she found her way to Watertown, a town that has had a large Armenian community since the early 1900s, with multiple churches, cultural centers, shops and bakeries. These refugees came to the United States and recreated an Armenian life in America. Hearing my grandmother’s story explained a lot that I had not understood about her and our community. She died in 1985.\n\nAfter she died, I did a lot of additional research and steeped myself in Armenian history. I feel that all four of my novels are a tribute to the ways Armenians have persevered despite trauma and pain. In *The Burning Heart of the World*, Vera’s grandmother refuses to leave Lebanon for the United States, causing emotional upheaval for Vera and her parents and siblings, who feel badly about leaving her behind.\n\n**EJB: The character Vera, her parents, brothers and husband all respond to the same events differently. Seeing the role personality plays helps the reader avoid formulaic assumptions about how events impact individual people. How did you model these characters?**\n\n**NK:** I interviewed at least 40 Armenians who had lived through the Lebanese Civil War. Some of the folks who were kids during the war remembered the period as fun. They told me that school was frequently canceled and, for them, staying in a shelter and playing with their friends was pleasant. In the novel, you see some of the girls flirting with boys. You also see the boys collecting bullets, which I was repeatedly told was a common male pastime. The adults, of course, had a very different account of those years.\n\nAs for temperament, even as a child, Vera was considered sensitive. She often wept over things she saw. Her mother was angry much of the time and presented as tough and businesslike. At one point in the book, when Vera is crying over something that happened, her mother berates her, saying, “You can’t cry for the whole world.” But Vera doesn’t accept this and thinks to herself that her mother is wrong, that it is absolutely possible to cry for the universe.\n\nHer brother, Armen, the middle child, has his own way of dealing with the war and is a daredevil. He not only collects bullets but, in one scene, shows his friends an unexploded grenade he found. At another point, he gets caught in a crossfire while riding his bike. He sees the war as an opportunity for adventure.\n\n**EJB: How much archival or other research did you do to learn about the civil war?**\n\n**NK: **The amount of detail about the war that made it into the final version of the novel is relatively small, but I immersed myself in Lebanese history. I learned about all the different militias in the civil war and about the leaders of each. But because the story is told from Vera’s perspective, and covers the period when she was between the ages of 10 and 15, when she is still in Lebanon, I wanted the story to focus on what she was thinking, feeling and seeing as a child and adolescent.\n\nPart of my research involved going to Lebanon. I traveled there three times; my goal was to make the experience of reading the book as immersive as possible. I wanted to present the streets, the sounds and the smells of the Armenian areas. I walked everywhere, went into people’s homes and visited the school Vera would have gone to. I looked at yearbooks for the years she would have been there and became fully engaged with the community despite being there decades after the war ended.\n\nAnd I read dozens of books. In fact, my early drafts of the novel were bristling with historical details that I later pared away.\n\nAs for the first section of the book, about 9/11, I went back to my journals from that period. I was in the city when the attacks happened, so I reread what I’d written. But I had to be sure to keep “Nancy” [referring to herself] and Vera separate. I needed to make sure that what I wrote in the novel was authentic to Vera’s personality and voice and did not reflect my own experience.\n\nFinally, I spoke to Lebanese-Armenian friends who had been in Beirut during the civil war and were also in New York City on 9/11. They told me that being in New York City during the attacks opened up old wounds for them. This helped me understand that the attacks would cause Beirut-Vera’s trauma to reemerge in American-Vera.\n\n**EJB: What do you hope readers will take away from ***The Burning Heart of the World***?**\n\n**NK: **The book’s release is timed to coincide with the start of the Lebanese Civil War 50 years ago. It also commemorates the 110th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. The book feels timely since Lebanon and the Middle East are again under assault.\n\nAll four books in the quartet are part of a chain. *Zabelle* was a fictionalized account of my grandmother’s experience as a genocide survivor and immigrant bride. *Dreams of Bread and Fire* was about people of my generation coming to terms with the unspoken trauma that overshadows their community. *All the Light There Was* is about people who fled to Paris during the genocide only to face the Nazis several decades later. The themes in my books are often dark, but I try to brighten them with humor. I enjoyed writing the scenes in *The Burning Heart of the World* where Vera’s 15-year-old cousin is hiding a romance with a 30-year-old man. Each of these books is for my people, Armenians around the world, but, of course, I mean for the books to be read more widely.\n\nIn addition to being a writer, I’m an organizer and I do Palestine solidarity work. The goal in my writing and activism is to inspire the humane in the human. Humans do a lot of terrible things, but I am interested in showing how people are able to retain their humanity in the face of war and mass violence.\n\nEleanor J.

        "content": "# What happened in Syria? How did al-Assad fall?\n\n*Opposition forces have taken control of the capital after a significant offensive. Here is how it unravelled.*\n\nIn the early hours of Sunday morning, opposition forces declared Syria liberated from the rule of President Bashar al-Assad as opposition forces surged into the capital.\n\nThe former president in question reportedly fled Damascus, with no information yet as to which country will receive him.\n\n## Recommended Stories\n\nlist of 4 items- list 1 of 4Where does Iran stand on Syria’s fast-moving conflict?\n- list 2 of 4Russia, Turkiye, Iran want ‘immediate end’ to fighting in Syria: Lavrov\n- list 3 of 4Syria war to have ‘massive’ effect on Lebanon: US envoy Hochstein\n- list 4 of 4Opposition fighters declare Syria’s Damascus ‘liberated’, al-Assad ousted\n\nThe stunning collapse of more than 53 years of al-Assad family rule has been described as a historic moment – nearly 14 years after Syrians rose in peaceful protests against a government that met them with violence that quickly spiralled into a bloody civil war.\n\nJust a week ago, the regime still maintained control over significant portions of the country. So how did it all unravel so quickly?\n\n\n\n## When did it start?\n\nOn November 27, a coalition of opposition fighters launched a major offensive against pro-government forces.\n\nThe first attack came at the front line between opposition-held Idlib and the neighbouring governorate of Aleppo.\n\nThree days later, the opposition fighters took Syria’s second-largest city, Aleppo.\n\n## Who did this?\n\nNamed Operation Deterrence of Aggression, this offensive was fought by several armed Syrian opposition groups led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and supported by allied Turkish-backed factions.\n\nHTS – led by Abu Mohammed al-Julani – is the largest and most organised, having ruled the governorate of Idlib for years before this offensive.\n\nOther groups that took part in the operation were the National Front for Liberation, Ahrar al-Sham, Jaish al-Izza and the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement, as well as Turkish-backed factions that fall under the umbrella of the Syrian National Army.\n\n\n\n## Has all of Syria fallen?\n\nProbably. Although opposition fighters did not enter Lattakia and Tartous, coastal governorates – seen as al-Assad strongholds.\n\nThe rebels advanced quickly – within days, they took Hama and Homs, a city once dubbed “Capital of the Revolution” during the early years of the war.\n\nOn Saturday, Deraa – the birthplace of the 2011 uprising – also slipped from government control.\n\nThe Syrian army announced it was “redeploying and repositioning” in the province and nearby Sweida, but that seemed to come to nought.\n\nThe United Kingdom-based war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), said Syrian troops were withdrawing from positions in Quneitra, near the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.\n\n\n\n## Why did al-Assad fall so fast?\n\nSyria was struggling as its economy tanked, reportedly propped up largely by an illicit trade in the psychoactive drug Captagon.\n\nAl-Assad became hugely unpopular as people found it harder and harder to survive, including his soldiers, the majority of whom did not want to fight for him.\n\nSoldiers and police officers were reportedly abandoning their posts, handing over their weapons, and fleeing ahead of the opposition advance.\n\nMilitarily as well, the al-Assad regime has been weak for years, relying on Russian and Iranian military support to prop it up.\n\nBut, analysts say, Russia is bogged down in its invasion of Ukraine and Iran and their Lebanese ally Hezbollah have been damaged by Israeli attacks – they could not come to the rescue of the faltering Syrian army.\n\n\n\n## Where is al-Assad?\n\nNobody knows where al-Assad is yet.\n\nHe and his Defence Minister Ali Abbas are both in unknown locations, according to Syrian Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali, who told Al Arabiya news website that they had lost communication on Saturday night.\n\nAccording to SOHR head Rami Abdel Rahman, al-Assad left Syria via Damascus international airport while it was secured by the army. Soldiers abandoned it shortly after and opposition fighters took control of it.\n\n## Has the whole government fled?\n\nNo, Prime Minister al-Jalali has stayed, speaking to the press early on Sunday to say he had remained to make sure things kept running.\n\n\n\n## Are Syrians happy?\n\nDamascus, Homs and other Syrian cities erupted in celebrations as the departure of al-Assad was announced.\n\nImages from Damascus captured opposition fighters firing into the air at sunrise. People climbed atop tanks in jubilation, amid crowds waving the flag of the revolution.\n\nIn some locations, people toppled statues of al-Assad’s father, Hafez.\n\nCrowds gathered to pray together in mosques and to celebrate in public squares, chanting anti-Assad slogans and honking car horns.\n\n\n\n## What happened in Sednaya prison?\n\nThe opposition fighters have opened regime prisons along their advance, setting free the prisoners of conscience held inside.\n\nHTS announced that its fighters had stormed the jail on the outskirts of the capital, declaring an “end of the era of tyranny in the prison of Sednaya”, a facility synonymous with the most notorious abuses of al-Assad’s regime.\n\nSOHR confirmed that “the doors of the infamous Sednaya prison … have been opened for thousands of detainees who were imprisoned by the security apparatus throughout the regime’s rule”.\n\n\n\n## What happens next?\n\nThat remains to be seen.\n\nAnalysts point out that there is a lot of potential for Syria, just as there are a number of possible pitfalls if the various parties do not cooperate.\n\nAl-Jalali said in a video statement that his cabinet is ready to “extend its hand” to the opposition and hand over its functions to a transitional government.\n\n“This country can be a normal country that builds good relations with its neighbours and the world … but this issue is up to any leadership chosen by the Syrian people,” al-Jalali said in a speech broadcast on his Facebook account.\n\nHTS leader al-Julani said in a statement on social media that “public institutions will remain under the supervision of the prime minister until they are officially handed over”.",

        "content": "The more than 50-year Assad dynastic dictatorship was on the cusp of collapse on Sunday, as rebel forces seized the capital of Damascus in a lightning offensive that has swept the country's largest cities in a matter of days.\n\nThe defense forces of the Russia and Iran-backed government have been struggling to stymy the rebel advance that kicked off with the rapid sweep of northern city Aleppo last week, breaking a years-long stalemate. The attack has been led by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) — which the U.S. and U.N. Security Council designated as a terrorist organization — and its allies, who have widened the scope of their campaign to the south of the country and now also captured the key cities of Hama and Deir el-Zor.\n\n\"We declare the city of Damascus free from the tyrant Bashar al-Assad,\" Hassan Abdul-Ghani, senior HTS commander, said in a post on WhatsApp. \"To the displaced people around the world, Free Syria awaits you.\"\n\nCNBC could not independently verify developments of the ground.\n\nThe whereabouts of President Bashar al-Assad, who assumed leadership in 2000 after the death of his father Hafez, were uncertain. Multiple media reports, which CNBC could not independently confirm, state he has fled Damascus. The Russian Foreign Ministry later on Sunday said that Assad had decided to leave his presidential post and the country.\n\nSyrian Prime Minister Ghazi al-Jalali said he remained at his home and was prepared to support the continuity of Syrian governance.\n\n\"We believe that Syria belongs to all Syrians and to all its citizens, and that this country can be a normal state, one that builds good relations with its neighbors without entering into any regional alliances or blocs,\" he said, according to NBC News reporting. \"This matter is left to any leadership chosen by the Syrian people, and we are ready to cooperate with them by providing all possible facilitation.\"\n\nThe U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen on Sunday stressed this is a \"watershed moment\" in the Syrian civil war, calling for \"stable and inclusive transitional arrangements.\"\n\nSeveral nations have evacuated their embassies amid the Damascus conflict, with outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden \"closely monitoring\" the events and retaining contact with regional partners, according to White House National Security Council Spokesman Sean Savett.\n\n## Distracted allies\n\nThe advance on Damascus comes after militants reached Homs – the country's third-largest city and a chokepoint between rebel-held territories and the capital city. Holding Homs would pose significant challenges for the rebels, who would have to confront a concentration of government forces and gain the support of local pro-Assad Alawite communities, Atlantic Council Senior Fellow Qutaiba Idlbi wrote on Dec. 5.\n\n\"More importantly, the rebels advancing toward Homs will test Russia's redlines in Syria. So far, Russia has been absent from providing serious military support to uphold Assad's defenses across areas he's losing to the rebels,\" Idlbi added. \"While Russia has conducted some airstrikes in Idlib and Aleppo to counter rebel advances, it has not engaged directly in Hama. This restraint reflects Moscow's strategic calculations to avoid overextension.\"\n\nSyria has been rocked by 13 years of civil conflict, sparked by the March 2011 pro-democracy demonstrations against repressive governmental rule, in lockstep with similar regional uprisings during the Arab Spring. The Assad administration answered the Syrian protests with deadly force, leading to calls for his resignation, nationwide unrest and the rise of opposition groups. Peace talks carried out separately by the U.N. and by Russia, Iran, and Turkey have yet to bear fruit.\n\nThe Syrian escalations take place as Assad's allies Russia and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have been increasingly distracted by battle on their own home fronts, engaging Ukraine and Israel, respectively. The Syrian unrest exacerbates the broader conflict in the Middle East, which was set off in October 2023 by a terror attack perpetrated by Palestinian militant group Hamas in Israel, leading to the Jewish nation's retaliatory military campaign in the Gaza Strip and to its fire exchanges with Hezbollah, Yemeni Houthi and Iran.\n\n\"This lightning-fast offensive is a monumental shift in the Syrian conflict and highlights the regime's inherent weakness,\" wrote Natasha Hall, a senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, further noting that the \"fragile stasis collapsed as Assad's allies, Iran and Hezbollah, have been significantly weakened\" by Israeli military offensives, while \"Russia has been bogged down in Ukraine and unrest in Georgia.\"\n\nIn an update on his Truth Social platform, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump suggested Assad's \"protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer. There was no reason for Russia to be there in the first place. They lost all interest in Syria because of Ukraine.\"\n\nMarkets have been watching the military developments for signs of an impact on supplies in the oil-rich Middle East, as well as further trade disruptions along critical trade routes.",

        "content": "# The Latin American grandchildren of Spanish exiles return 100 years later\n\nOne million Spaniards emigrated to Latin America after the Civil War. Today, their grandchildren — many with dual nationality — are residents of the Spanish capital\n\nJuan Acevedo Fernández discovered by chance that he was living just steps away from his family’s past. He’s 34 years old and lives on Augusto Figueroa Street in the center of Madrid. One day, while searching for a document to renew his grandmother’s passport, he read an address that sounded familiar: Gravina 7, main floor. It was the building he saw every day when turning the corner.\n\nHe looked it up in the city’s property registry, verified the details, and stood frozen. “I said, ‘Wow, I’m living a hundred meters away.’ Without knowing it, I’d come back to the starting point,” he recalls. There, in that very building, on October 7, 1928, his grandfather Jesús Fernández Merino was born. Almost a century later, his grandson had returned to the place where it all began.\n\nConsuelo Naranjo Orovio, former director of the Center for Human and Social Sciences at Spain’s CSIC research center, explains in her book *The Migrations from Spain to Latin America since Independence* that “between 1880 and 1930 [a period known as the ‘mass emigration’], just under 4.5 million Spaniards emigrated. All regions of Spain took part in this process. Argentina and Cuba were the main destinations, followed by Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Mexico. The 1929 crisis marked the end of mass emigration. Starting in 1945, departures to Latin America resumed, although the destinations changed and the composition of emigrants was different.”\n\nThe Fernández family’s story spans the Spanish Civil War, exile, and Spain’s rebuilding. In 1939, after the fall of Catalonia, a van from Spain’s National Telephone Company — the origin of what is now Telefónica — evacuated several Republican families through the Portbou border in Girona.\n\nJesús’s father was interned in the Argelès-sur-Mer camp, while the rest of the family settled in Poitiers, where Jesús grew up under Nazi occupation. In 1950, they emigrated to Caracas on a humanitarian flight.\n\nThree years later, the French construction company Campenon Bernard sent him to Colombia to work on the Bajo Anchicayá dam in Valle del Cauca, on the Colombian Pacific coast. He married, settled down, and founded a distributor of Spanish technical books that became a well-known name in the industry. He never wanted to change his passport. “He said that if he became a citizen, he’d have to stop being Spanish — and he never wanted that,” Juan recalls.\n\nAt home, they ate dinner late, drank vermouth, and spoke with a Madrid accent. Long after-dinner conversations, books, and the way stories were told kept the family connection alive. “My grandfather used to say his perfect place was somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic, not knowing whether he was coming or going.”\n\nIn 2016, Acevedo began working in Bogotá for a Spanish communications agency. Years later, he was offered a transfer to Madrid. “My grandfather always wanted to return, but couldn’t. So when the chance came, it was an instant yes.”\n\nWhen he arrived, he lived in several places in Madrid, all near old family addresses: Campoamor, General Pardiñas, Gravina. “I’m not starting from scratch. I’m continuing a story.” Acevedo has held Spanish nationality since birth, but he doesn’t think that’s what matters most. “I feel very Latin American, and also deeply Spanish. Every time I walk past Gravina, I feel like something has come full circle. That my grandfather is there, that the exile wasn’t in vain. I feel like we’ve all made a long journey back home. And this time, we’ve made it.”\n\nLike Acevedo, more and more grandchildren of Spanish emigrants are returning to Madrid, completing a family cycle of departure and return. Some come for work, others to study — many with European passports from birth, and others having recently regained citizenship thanks to the Democratic Memory Law, which since 2022 allows descendants of exiles to obtain Spanish nationality without residing in the country. Migration, as always, flows in both directions — though some would rather forget that.\n\nBetween the 1950s and 1970s, more than 80,000 Spaniards settled in Colombia alone, according to the Francisco Largo Caballero Foundation, which published a study in 2009 on Spanish emigration to Latin America. Fleeing the dictatorship and the poverty of the postwar years, these Spaniards integrated into industrial, agricultural, and commercial sectors. In cities like Bogotá, Medellín, or Barranquilla, they built community networks that still endure.\n\nIn Colombia’s capital, for example, places like the Casa de España were cultural hubs of the Republican exile. Some children of exiles studied at the Colegio Reyes Católicos, which follows the Spanish education system and is now part of Spain’s network of public schools abroad. In many homes, memories of Spain survived through accents, recipes, and photo albums. Today, more than half a century later, the grandchildren of those migrants walk the streets of Madrid.\n\nDiana Cid, a 27-year-old Venezuelan journalist, has lived in Madrid for a decade. Three of her four grandparents were Spanish. Her paternal grandparents, from the Spanish region of Galicia, emigrated to Caracas in the 1950s — he in 1957, she in 1960. They were farmworkers fleeing hunger.\n\n“My grandfather was one of those thousands of Galicians who boarded a ship in search of work and opportunity,” says Cid. In Venezuela, her grandfather worked in agriculture, construction, and as a building superintendent. Her grandmother was a cleaner. They never returned, but never disconnected either. “They watched Spanish TV, talked about their hometown, and about how hard it had been to leave,” she recalls.\n\nCid grew up eating *cocido gallego *[a traditional stew] in Venezuela’s sweltering heat and humidity: “One morning it was *arepas*, the next, Galician bread with whatever was available.” Her memories are full of contrasts. “My grandfather brushed his teeth for the first time at 18 in Caracas. My grandmother tasted butter for the first time on the ship to Venezuela.” They were humble migrants, but they managed to get ahead. They bought a house, educated their children. “They built a life there that they never could have had in Spain.”\n\nToday, Cid walks through the city her grandparents never returned to. She arrived with a Spanish passport and a clear sense of purpose: she wasn’t just passing through. “I always knew I wanted to stay.” The first time she visited Galicia, things clicked into place. “I understood why my grandfather always searched for greenery in Caracas. That landscape was his refuge.” For her, migration was also a way to recover a borrowed memory.\n\nJosé Luis Díaz García, a 53-year-old industrial engineer, arrived in Madrid 14 years ago. Like many others, his story is one of opportunity and roots. His partner was Venezuelan, and he had Spanish nationality through his grandfather, who was born in the town of Ólvega, back when the region was still called Old Castile rather than Castilla y León. That’s how his grandfather wrote it in his diary, which Díaz read many years later. It tells the story of a man who left Spain in 1923, first traveling to Cuba and later settling in Colombia, where he founded one of the first photography shops in Pereira, in the heart of Colombia’s coffee region. He became Kodak’s second distributor in the country.\n\n“He migrated with practically nothing and ended up building a fortune. He was a pioneer,” his grandson recalls. The business left behind a photo archive that is now part of the city’s history. “He had a strong character, was very charismatic, and turned everything he touched into an opportunity,” says the Spanish-Colombian Díaz.\n\nAccording to Spain’s National Statistics Institute (INE), around 9.3 million people living in Spain today were born abroad — of these, four million were born in Latin America. Of that total, roughly 30% have acquired Spanish nationality, meaning many retain the citizenship of their country of origin. Behind many of these dual nationalities lie migrations that are, in fact, returns.\n\nDíaz grew up with chickpeas, *sevillana *music, and copies of *¡Hola!* magazine arriving by airmail. “My grandfather was a monarchist. He listened to shortwave radio and kept up with everything happening in Spain,” says Díaz.\n\nThat shared identity lived on in small details: the names of farms, family temperaments, certain traditions. When he landed in Madrid for the first time, Díaz didn’t plan to stay — but he did. “It felt like a revelation. I walked down Gran Vía and started recognizing things I had only ever heard about. Everything made sense.”\n\nDecades later, he returned to Ólvega and even met the grandchildren of his grandfather’s siblings. “I feel a sense of responsibility as a migrant. You represent your country, but also the family that once left with nothing. My grandfather was welcomed with open arms in Latin America. Now that I’m here, I try to honor that story — with work, respect, and remembrance.”\n\nMigration is one of the far-right’s favorite targets, but official data points to a quiet and legitimate transformation. More than one million Latin Americans live in the Madrid region, according to the latest INE figures. Often, those returning don’t even realize they’re walking the same ground where it all began. Other times, they seek it out intentionally. But all of them carry a story with them — the story of human migration, as old as humanity itself.\n\n*Sign up for **our weekly newsletter** to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition*\n\n## Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo\n\n¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?\n\nSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.\n\nFlecha## Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.\n\nSi quieres compartir tu cuenta, cambia tu suscripción a la modalidad Premium, así podrás añadir otro usuario.

        "content": "On May 3, the Organisation of Hellene and Hellene-Cypriot Women of Australia (SA) Inc (OEEGA SA), Festival Hellenika, and the Greek Museum of Adelaide, as part of the South Australian History Festival, held ‘*The **Greeks of Tashkent** – A Photographic Exhibition*.’ It reveals a largely untold story of the Greek civil war, political exile, and cultural persistence in the city of Tashkent in Uzbekistan, through rare Soviet-era photographs and archival material.\n\nThe keynote address was delivered by Dr Helen Vatsikopoulos, award-winning journalist and academic, whose family history is directly connected to the narrative. Her aunt Aspasia was a teenage conscript in the communist Democratic Army of Greece (DAG) and one of the thousands sent into exile.\n\nDr Vatsikopoulos traced the trajectory of over 12,000 DAG fighters and supporters who fled to Albania after their defeat in the Greek Civil War (1946–1949), describing their movements through a secret Soviet evacuation, ordered by Joseph Stalin, from Albania, across the Black Sea and into the USSR. Their journey ended in Tashkent, capital of Soviet Uzbekistan. The destination remained a secret to all except to DAG commanders and Greek Communist Party (KKE) leaders. By December 1949, the rollcall of the Tashkent Greeks was “8,571 men, 3,401 women, 25 children…[and] 70% were members of the Greek Communist Party.”\n\nDr Vatsikopoulos explained that after Stalin’s death in 1953, de-Stalinisation policies led to ideological cracks emerging in the community, where, in 1955, violent in-fighting broke out. Despite this, the community would evolve, with the mid-1950s to 1960s bringing opportunity. Greeks attended universities, became engineers, artists, doctors. Cultural life flourished with Greek language, dance, theatre, and music uniting a people longing for their homeland.\n\nIn 1972, the Tashkent Greek population peaked at approximately 35,000. After 1974, following the end of the Junta in Greece, the first wave of Tashkent Greeks began repatriation to Greece under the supervision of the International Red Cross.\n\nSome Tashkent veterans and their offspring migrated directly to Australia, Canada and the US. Approximately 6,000 Greeks across four generations, remained in Tashkent.\n\nIn 1982, Greece’s Government declared a full amnesty for all remaining Civil War political refugees and restoration of Greek citizenship.\n\nBy 2024, only 1,500 Greeks remain in Tashkent. Their story is preserved through the Greek Cultural Centre of Tashkent, which was recently restored.\n\nFollowing Dr Vatsikopoulos’ keynote, Consul General of Greece in SA, Dr Alexandra Theodoropoulou, officially launched the event and reflected on the painful and important past events, stating that “all the stories of the civil war and secrets are amazing, and we all have parts of our family [history] that are silent. Sometimes we get the lessons not from the Motherland Greece but from the diaspora [through exhibitions such as this].”\n\nThe exhibition brings to light the resilience of Greek identity and its enduring preservation even when separated from Greece, and serves to educate Greek and Philhellenes alike on a chapter of Greek history shrouded by sorrow, complexity and intergenerational stories.\n\n*The exhibition is open from 3–30 May, Wednesdays to Saturdays, 11:00am–3:00pm at the Cowandilla Community Room, Hilton SA.*\n\n*The exhibition was conceived and co-curated by Centre President Costas Politis, former ABC Foreign Correspondent journalist Mark Corcoran, and journalist and University of Technology Sydney Fellow Dr Helen Vatsikopoulos.*",
